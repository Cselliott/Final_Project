transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of december 11 2007
chairman bernanke  good early morning  laughter  i would like to start by
thanking the committee for the very useful discussion we had last week although i must say that
videoconference is not the most intimate format  people raised a number of important
reservations about the taf including the fact that capital perhaps more than liquidity is the
issue now issues about the size of it and concern about stigma  i think that those points are well
taken and that we need to be modest in our expectations about at least the initial effect of this
facility  however as i indicated last week i think that it will perhaps provide a platform for us
to create a more flexible tool that will allow us to use our discount window facilities in a more
effective way as we go forward  in the near term it has also provided a good vehicle for us to
cooperate with other central banks and i would like to update you on that now
first the board did approve the taf on friday by notation vote as we expected
second we have been in communication with the whole g10 about these matters and have
widespread support from our colleagues for this action  in particular i believe that you have a
draft press release that will be very similar to what will be released tomorrow morning  what
time is it  its at 830 am now
mr kohn  900 am
chairman bernanke  tomorrow morning at 900  it will be a joint release of five
central banks  the press release will have a common first paragraph as you see in front of you
and then each central bank will describe its own actions in more detail followed by web links to
the other central banks  in particular the european central bank will take the 20 billion in
swaps that we approved last week and will do two essentially noncompetitive auctions  that is
they will allocate 20 billion in two tranches to european banks needing dollars at the price that
clears the us taf so they may have to ration or otherwise allocate  that is their problem
the swiss national bank will also do a 4 billion onetime auction  lets see they are going to
do an actual auction
mr kohn  are they  i think with a reservation price
vice chairman geithner  with a reservation price is our understanding
chairman bernanke  okay  at our stopout rate
mr sheets  the minimum bid will be onemonth ois
chairman bernanke  okay  so they have the same auction plan that we have
essentially  in addition we are being joined by the british who are doing two auctions of
10 billion each before yearend  these are sterling auctions not dollar auctions but they are in
fact of the same actual size as oursan indication of the appreciation of the pound  finally the
canadians were already planning to do some auctions before the end of the year and they will
simply join us in announcing those at the same time  in addition the japanese and the swedes
although not planning anything in the near term will issue statements supporting our actions and
affirming their willingness to support liquidity as necessary  so i am hopeful  again i think our
expectations should be modest  this is not a oneshot deal  we will continue to try to address
these problems but i am hopeful that the international aspect of this will also be at least
somewhat reassuring to markets  there will be i think a bit of disappointment today that we
dont cut the discount rate spread but by tomorrow morning i hope that will be resolved one
way or another
a few people have asked about informing their boards  i have no objection to your
informing your board if you wish in advance of the announcementso long of course as it is
with the usual confidentiality rules  what i might suggest to you to consider is that perhaps a
compromise between doing nothing and informing your whole board might be to give a call to
your chairman sometime today and just give a headsup if you choose  i am just indicating that
we have no objection to your doing that
there is one piece of business remaining associated with this which is that we have to
approve the 4 billion swap request from the swiss national bank  what i would propose to do
is allow bill to begin his report on desk operations  subsequent to that we can take questions
either on the financial conditions that bill describes on any of these aspects and then i would
like along with the ratification of operations to ask you at that time also for a vote on the swap
so if there is no question or comment at this point i will turn to bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the exhibits that you should have in front of you  over the past few months the outlook for residential housing has continued to darken  rising inventories and tightening credit standards have led to outright declines in home prices in many major housing markets  the deterioration in the subprime mortgage space continues  as shown in exhibit 1 delinquency and foreclosure rates for subprime mortgages continue to rise very quickly and as before the degree and the pace of deterioration are much worse for more recent vintages see exhibit 2  but most important the problems in residential mortgages can no longer be thought of as a subprime or even an alta mortgage problem  as shown in exhibit 3 delinquency and foreclosure rates on prime mortgages have moved up sharply in recent months
the ongoing deterioration in the housing market has had a number of important implications  the first important development is that highly rated collateralized debt obligation cdo tranchesincluding socalled supersenior aaarated tranches are now vulnerable  that is because these tranches typically are backstopped in part by lowerrated subprime abs tranches and other mortgagerelated securities product for highly rated cdo tranches to be protected against loss it is important that the average loss rate on the underlying collateral stays relatively low and that the correlation in loss performance among the different assets that underpin the cdo stays low  unfortunately for many of the cdos issued in 2006 and 2007 these conditions no longer apply  as housing has deteriorated not only have expected loss rates climbed but the correlation among the assets within cdos has also moved sharply higher  this has occurred because a growing proportion of bbbrated and
arated abs tranches now appear likely to suffer losses  at a 10 percent average

1  materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
loss rate on subprime arms many bbb and arated tranches are likely to survive there is a dispersion of loss ratessay between 5 percent and 15 percentthat helps keep correlations low  but at a 15 percent loss rate the same degree of dispersion protects many fewer tranches than before  instead most of these tranches will become impaired  as this occurs the correlation rate will climb sharply  the net result is that cdo tranches that were thought to be safe become highly vulnerable to losses
exhibits 4 and 5 illustrate the sensitivity of cdo performance to the mortgage loanloss rate  these exhibits summarize a study by ubs of a large number of cdos brought to market in 2006 and 2007  exhibit 4 shows how sensitive the performance of the cdo market is to changes in underlying mortgage loss rates  the base case scenario assumes a relatively favorable loss experience  for example in the base case losses for subprime mortgages are assumed to be about 11 percent for both 2006 and 2007 vintages  in this case total loss estimates for mezzanine cdos are around 20 percent and less than 5 percent for highgrade cdos  in the base case the losses for the supersenior tranches are trivial  but when loss estimates increase 50 percent above the base case loss estimates on the cdo tranches climb much more sharply
for example the average losses for the mezzanine cdos triple rising six times faster than the rise in underlying loan losses and expected losses on the supersenior mezzanine cdo tranches soar  in this case they are anticipated to lose about one half of their value  exhibit 5 focuses on how a relatively modest change in the loss rate on the underlying mortgages leads to a sharp shift in the distribution of losses  in the base case the supersenior tranches of most cdos are expected to suffer no losses  however at the higher loss rate on the underlying mortgages about half the supersenior tranches are expected to lose more than half their value
the cdo market is now fully implicated in the housing crisis  the rating agencies are now downgrading many cdos and the magnitude of the downgrades is often quite large  as a result the value of many cdos has fallen sharply  this has led to 1 large writedowns at some major financial institutions and 2 questions about the financial health of the financial guarantors that ensure some of the super senior cdo tranches and that have other exposure to the residential mortgage market exhibit 6 illustrates the large movements in two of the major financial guarantors share prices and credit default swaps over the last few months  moodys recently indicated that mbiagenerally perceived as one of the stronger playersis somewhat likely to need to raise more capital to avoid a creditrating downgrade
mbia announced yesterday that they are raising 1 billion in equity capital from warburg pincus
the total outstanding volume of assetbacked commercial paper has begun to contract more rapidly again see exhibit 7  this contraction appears relatively broad basedit is not just an siv story  the master liquidity enhancement conduit mlec continues to move slowly forward with the syndication process having just started  but the mlec is not likely to be very large  siv assets have already shrunk sharply and some banks have already taken siv assets back on their own balance
sheets  the difficulties of the sivs have affected some money market investment fundswith the state of floridas local government investment pool the most notable casualty in this regard  fortunately most money market funds that have siv exposure are backed by strong parents that have been willing to lend support at least up till now
the second key developmentthe deterioration in the performance of the broader mortgage markethas had its own set of effects on the financial sector  first it has led to significant loanloss provision charges and marktomarket losses for the two major housing gsesfannie mae and freddie mac  the result has been a sharp decline in their share prices and a substantial rise in the cost of credit default swaps for these institutions see exhibit 8  second the mortgage insurers have also been implicated with even more substantial share price declines and increases in the cost of credit default protection see exhibit 9  in addition the big thrift institutions remain under pressure  yesterday for example washington mutual announced large loanloss provisions and other writedowns and slashed its common stock dividend
for commercial banks the consequence of cdo writedowns and of rising mortgage and other loan losses has been even more pressure on capital ratios and on balance sheets  also corporate debt spreads have increased markedly over the past few months see exhibit 10  the rise in highyield debt spreads is important for banks that still have significant leveragedloan exposure that they hope to distribute to the capital markets  the widening in spreads suggests a risk of further marktomarket charges for banks for these exposures
so is there any good news in any of this  i would emphasize four aspects that might provide some modest reassurance  first market participants know a lot more now than they did before  thus fear is diminishing which implies less risk of a crisis developing from this source  second although there remain considerable uncertainties on many frontssuch as the magnitude of mortgage losses the degree of further tightening of credit availability and the fate of some thrifts and mortgage and financial guarantors i believe we may have finally defined the broad dimensions of the crisis  most of those who are likely to be implicated may already have been identified with the cdo debacle the latest installment that has widened the circle of participants  the issue now seems to be shifting toward severity from dimension
third the market is resolving some aspects of the crisis on its own  for example the level of siv assets has shrunk sharply since august  fourth several major financial institutions in addition to mbia and washington mutual have raised capital from disparate sources  citigroup and ubs are raising funds from sovereign wealth funds etrade raised funds from a major hedge fund  fannie mae and freddie mac have raised capital through preferred stock issues  the willingness of opportunistic investors to make such commitments may limit the balance sheet squeeze somewhat and put a flooralbeit a low oneunder asset prices
let me turn next to market expectations about the path of shortterm interest rates at this meeting and beyond  exhibit 11 shows expectations for the current meeting calculated from options prices on federal funds rate futures  as can be seen the
probability of a 25 basis point cut has climbed to about 70 percent and the probability of no change in the target federal funds rate has fallen virtually to zero  as shown in exhibits 12 and 13 expectations for subsequent rate cuts have increased considerably since the october meeting whether one looks at the yields implied from federal funds futures contracts or from eurodollar futures contracts  looking out to the end of 2008 rate expectations have fallen more than 50 basis points since the october fomc meeting  the eurodollar futures rate for december 2008 implies more than 100 basis points of additional easing  our survey of primary dealers also shows a sharp shift downward in rate expectations since the october fomc meeting  as shown by comparing exhibit 14 with exhibit 15 the average of the dealer modal forecasts for the federal funds rate target in the first quarterthe green circles in the exhibitsfell about 30 basis points and the average of the dealer modal forecasts does not differ meaningfully from market expectations at that time period
however longer term the primary dealers forecasts seem to anticipate less easing than market participants  but this may reflect more the downward skew to rate expectations that pulls the mean below the mode rather than a more fundamental difference in expectations  as has been the case for several months there is a very wide dispersion of forecasts one year ahead with the primary dealers modal forecasts now ranging from 25 percent to 475 percent  despite an expectation of moreaggressive easing inflation expectations appear to be well anchored  exhibit  16 shows two measures that i discussed at the october fomc meetingthe market based barclays measure of fiveyear fiveyear forward inflation versus the board staff measure  as can be seen although the gap between these two measures has remained much wider than earlier in the yearpresumably reflecting in part a climb in the liquidity premium for ontherun nominal treasuriesboth measures have moved down a bit since the october fomc meeting
finally a very brief discussion of the desks open market operations is warranted
as seen in exhibit 17 which shows the cumulative effective federal funds rate since the last meeting we have managed to keep the federal funds rate close to the target on average  but it hasnt been easy  as you can see the rate did trade a bit soft to the target early in the intermeeting period  also we continue to see upward pressure on the federal funds rate early in the dayreflecting a strong bid by european banks and much greater intraday and daytoday volatility than before august
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the october 3031 fomc meeting  i also request a vote to ratify the swap agreement with the swiss national bank that chairman bernanke discussed earlier  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for bill on financial
conditions or for bill or me on the taf proposal  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i have an observation and that is bill that
most of your presentation has to do with spreads rather than with the absolute level of rates
although it is true that spreads remain wide the absolute level of the highquality rates in
general has come down i believe  prime mortgage rates are down and it seems to me that if we
look only at spreads then of course our actions to reduce the federal funds rate target may not
show up for quite some time  in fact i think most people have the sense that spreads had gotten
too narrow and they may end up being elevated for a long time even as a permanent matter
so i think it is very important to look at the level of rates as well as the spreads and i insert the
commentand i notice youre nodding your head yesthat the rates on highquality paper
have in general come down  the rates on riskier paper are perhaps higher than they were lets
say in july
mr dudley  yes i think that is correct  if you look at chart 10 which shows
corporate credit spreads you have a widening of about 50 basis points in investmentgrade
corporate spreads at a time that longtermyou know tenyeartreasury note yields have
come down by i think a little larger magnitude  in contrast in the highyield debt market you
have a widening of spreads of 200 basis points just in the last month and a half or two months
which is much more dramatic than any decline that we have seen in treasury rates
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i asked the staff to put together a tablethe
table iiit1 that we get in the greenbookand compare rates with august 6  it turns out that
all the rates are about the same as they were on august 6 for the bond yields and equity prices
are essentially unchanged maybe down or upactually upjust a tick  so i would say that the
75 basis points of easing we did and the additional 100 that the market has priced in since
august 6 have had no effect on the cost of longterm credit to corporations
chairman bernanke  i think it is probably worth observing that the spreads
probably also are correlated with nonprice terms  so it may not be an exactly neutral change
president fisher
mr fisher  bill we talked a bit about this on the phone yesterday but on the four
relatively optimistic points that you mentioned the fourth point which is what i call the
substitutability of capital we are seeing new sources  one of them is measurable which is the
gic in singapore  but do we have any sense of the dimension that is available for substitution
and is there a way to get a better sense of measurement  i just want to preface this by saying that
we went through the petrodollar issue in 1974  some of us were very involved in that exercise
it is a much more sophisticated business right now and we have much more sophisticated
investors  what we dont knowor i dont know and i would be curious whether we know at
the new york deskis how big this money is and how much is available to be tapped
mr dudley  well i guess i would say two things  i think you are absolutely right
that the sovereign wealth funds are of significant size and are growing rapidly  but i think that
you really have to distinguish between the equity side and the debt side of things  the
commitments that you are seeing from the sovereign wealth funds seem to be equity investments
and they are equity investments that have occurred only after share prices fell very sharply  if
you look at debt spreads in the united states debt spreads in europe and debt spreads
throughout the world they have widened  so it doesnt look as though the sovereign wealth fund
money is providing much help for that sector  it would be surprising if it were big enough given
the constraints on bank balance sheets globally that they could come in and fill the gaps  so i
think on the equity side the sovereign wealth funds are pretty important  they are providing
some floor on equity prices but only after the equity prices of some of these financial firms have
gone down very significantly in value
mr fisher  nonetheless they can restore tier 1 capital as we saw in the case of ubs
i mean that is how markets work
mr dudley  yes  it is a good development that we are actually finally seeing banks
raise capital  i dont think you were seeing that until last month  i would say that there was
stigma associated with raising capital and then things got progressively worse so banks were
just forced to raise capital despite the stigma associated with it
mr fisher  well i wanted to thank you for at least raising four rays of dim sunlight
mr dudley  we try for balance
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  bill the trouble with the mortgage
insurers has been a development since our last meeting and i am curiousdo they have the
capability for raising capital  will raising capital correct or help them get their ratings back to
aaa or is it more complicated than that  i have read some concerns about the effect for
example on municipal markets if the guarantors cannot in fact maintain their ratings  so do you
have some insight into their ability to raise capital and correct the potential for a downgrade
mr dudley  the risk to the municipal market is really through the financial
guarantors not so much the mortgage insurers  the fact that mbia was able to raise 1 billion
of equity capital yesterday for i think about oneseventh of their book valueso it is a fairly
large capital commitment relative to the size of the companyis an important development
you saw that mbia stock yesterday rose more than 10 percent because it basically was a
confirmation at least in the minds of some people in the market that mbia was a viable
business and that someone was willing to put 1 billion of new capital in  i think that was
reassuring to the market  generally the people i have talked with suggest that the barriers to
entry into those businesses are pretty high  the second thing that is happening is obviously as
you see this distress their pricing power on new business is actually improving  that would
suggest that there is a reasonable chance that these firms will be recapitalized but it depends on
how far down the path they are toward serious problems
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just a quick comment  i have talked to one of the large mortgage
insurance companies in some detail and their view is that their pricing power actually is
improvingthat their own ability to work their way out of this thing is getting better all the time
right now  even though they are taking some very large hits in the near term their outlook
actually has improved in recent months partly because of this  this was just to reinforce that
point
chairman bernanke  other questions for bill  if not we need to vote to ratify
domestic operations
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  okay  we also need a vote on the
swiss request for a currency swap
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any commentary  president poole
mr poole  i vote against the swap for the same reason that i did before which i
would like to amplify if i may just for a moment
chairman bernanke  why dont you make your comment and then we will take
a roll call vote
mr poole  okay  as i said in our conference call foreign central banks have ample
amounts of reserves  the swap is therefore in my view not necessary  i would like to make
one other observation  in the past the swaps have been most often used in conjunction with
operations to intervene in the foreign exchange markets  i worry that we may get a reaction in
the market given the concerns in europe about the value of the dollar that would say that this is
a precursor to some sort of coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market  i would be
very opposed to the intervention i think it would upset things quite substantially and i would
worry that the market concerns that there might be intervention coming would upset the situation
on this announcement  so those are my concerns and why i vote against
chairman bernanke  thank you  we will of course announce a swap in the
context of our plan to address money market issues  with respect to the issue of their reserves i
think there are two reasons for having the swap  one is that for technical reasons it is easier for
them to segregate their foreign exchange reserves from the money they would use in this auction
they felt it was bureaucratically easier for them to do it this way  second this obviously gives
uswhich is very important for our monetary controlsort of a clear marker in terms of what
the size of this operation will be and so on  but your points are well taken  any other
comments  if not debbie could you please read the resolution
ms danker  the federal open market committee directs the federal reserve bank
of new york to establish and maintain a reciprocal currency arrangement for the system open
market account with the swiss national bank in an amount not to exceed 4 billion  the
committee authorizes associated draws on the arrangement up to the full amount of 4 billion
the swap arrangement shall be for a period of up to 180 days unless extended by the
committee
chairman bernanke                              yes
vice chairman geithner                       yes
president evans                                     yes
president hoenig                                   yes
governor kohn                                     yes
governor kroszner                               yes
governor mishkin                                 yes

governor warsh                                    yes
chairman bernanke  all right  thank you  let us turn now to the economic
situation and dave stockton
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  we had a great deal to contend with over the intermeeting period and the forecast has changed in some important ways  nevertheless the basic story underlying our projection remains largely unchanged  the fallout from the slump in the housing sector the ongoing turbulence in financial markets and elevated energy prices result in subpar growth over the next several quarters  with some further easing of monetary policy a levelingoff of oil prices and a gradual improvement of financial conditions growth picks back up toward potential in 2009  the gap in resource utilization that opens up over the next several quarters in combination with the anticipated flatteningout of energy prices puts total and core inflation on a mild downtrend over the longer haul
overall our forecast could admittedly be read as still painting a pretty benign picture  despite all the financial turmoil the economy avoids recession and even with steeply higher prices for food and energy and a lower exchange value of the dollar we achieve some modest edgingoff of inflation  so i tried not to take it personally when i received a notice the other day that the board had approved more frequent drugtesting for certain members of the senior staff myself included laughter  i can assure you however that the staff is not going to fall back on the increasingly popular celebrity excuse that we were under the influence of mind altering chemicals and thus should not be held responsible for this forecast  no we came up with this projection unimpaired and on nothing stronger than many late nights of diet pepsi and vendingmachine twinkies
while our basic story hasnt changed much the events of the past six weeks have resulted in a considerable darkening of our outlook for activity over the next year  in particular the incoming data have been weaker than expected the projected path of household net worth has been revised down owing to lower prices for both equities
and houses oil prices average about 7 per barrel higher than in our previous forecast and the brief improvement in financial conditions that we experienced in september and october has been reversed in recent weeks  as a consequence we now project that real gdp will be about flat in the current quarter after having increased at an annual rate of 5 percent in the third quarter  although the sharp swing in activity from the third to the fourth quarters is exaggerated by some wide fluctuations in inventory investment we are reading the incoming data as suggesting that there has been a greater downshift in the underlying pace of growth than we had previously anticipated  furthermore we expect activity to remain sluggish next year growing 1 percent nearly  percentage point less than in our october projection
in 2009 real gdp is projected to grow at a 21 percent pace a touch below our previous forecast
most of the disappointing news that we have received over the past six weeks has centered on the household sector most especially on residential construction  single family housing starts came in a bit below expectations and permits plunged suggesting some further intensification of the decline in construction activity in the months immediately ahead  moreover substantial downward revisions to estimates of new home sales for earlier months indicate that housing demand has been weaker than we previously thought  meanwhile conditions in mortgage markets have deteriorated further and appear likely to remain impaired longer than we had projected in october  nonprime markets remain moribund spreads on jumbo mortgages have widened further and spreads on conforming mortgages to treasuries have increased  these developments along with the weaker incoming data on sales and starts led us to mark down our housing forecast once again  we now expect that sales and starts will post a further drop of nearly 10 percent by early next year
moreover we have delayed our projected recovery in starts until 2009  as a consequence the contraction in residential investment is now expected to subtract over  percentage point from the growth of real gdp next year about  percentage point more than in our october projection
in addition to these softer readings on housing activity the incoming data on consumer spending also have surprised us to the downside  real outlays are now estimated to have been nearly flat between august and october rather than increasing modestly as had earlier appeared to be the case  that subdued pace seems consistent with the slump in consumer sentiment that has followed in the wake of the increased financial turbulence  we now project that real pce increased at a
1 percent pace in the current quarter 1 percentage point less than in the october greenbook  i dont want to overstate the strength of our case that a noticeable slowing in consumer spending is under way  light motor vehicle sales ran at a
162 million unit pace in november an observation that creates a bit of tension with the survey reports of bummedout consumers  moreover it wouldnt take much more than a few modest upward revisions to earlier months or a pop in spending in december to undermine this part of our story  that said the picture doesnt seem likely to us to brighten much soon  the recent jump in oil prices coupled with a restoration of currently narrow gasoline margins points to steep increases in retail
energy prices that will take a bite out of the purchasing power of household incomes and further restrain overall consumer spending in coming months  furthermore with the lower level of the stock market and a downward revision to our houseprice forecast household net worth is expected to exert more of a drag on consumer spending over the next two years than in our previous forecast  while we dont expect a dramatic shift we are anticipating that households will face tighter standards and moreexpensive terms for consumer credit  all told we are projecting real pce to increase 1 percent in 2008 about  percentage point less than in our october projection
in contrast to the almost uniformly weakerthanexpected data on the household sector the information that we have received on business spending has been more mixed  investment in hightech equipment has been well below our expectations especially for communications equipment  that observation squares with some reports we have heard that orders for hightech gear from financial institutions have fallen off  other equipment spending has come in close to our expectations with the recent data on orders and shipments consistent with our projection for some modest slowing in capital spending  the data also have been mixed for nonresidential structures  as i noted at the last meeting the gdp data for the third quarter pointed to stronger drilling activity than we had earlier anticipated and we have revised up our projection for this category in response to both the incoming data and the higher projected path for energy prices  for nonresidential buildings the october data for construction put in place were a bit below our expectations and we have lowered our nearterm projection of activity in this sector  beyond the near term we have reduced our forecast for both equipment spending and nonresidential investment  most of that revision reflects an expected endogenous response of investment to the slower growth of final sales and business output in this projection  but we also have made some small allowance for what we expect to be less favorable financing conditions and greater uncertainty over the next year
taken as a whole the spending data have clearly fallen short of our expectations it might appear that like the spending data last weeks labor market report was also a downside surprise for us after all we noted in the greenbook that we had penciled in an increase of 100000 for private payrolls in november  however we did that only grudgingly after seeing the adp survey last wednesday morning and basically we did not allow that change to alter any other important aspect of our forecast  in fact the payroll employment figures are slightly stronger than we expected at the time of the october greenbook  indeed i still see the generally firm conditions in labor markets as suggesting some upside risk to our view that the economy is in the process of slowing sharply
let me now turn to the inflation forecast  total pce prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of 3 percent in the current quarter about  percentage point above our previous forecast  most of that revision reflects higher retail energy prices  but we have also raised our projection of core pce prices for the third and fourth quarters by  percentage point  that adjustment resulted from the upward
revisions made by the bea to nonmarket prices in earlier months  as you know we had been consistently surprised by the mild increases in nonmarket prices that had been reported since the spring  as a concession to those persistent errors a couple of forecast rounds ago we pushed off the reacceleration of those prices into 2008  well we should have stuck with our earlier story because the revised data now show that those prices picked back up in late summer and early fall
our slight upward revision to core pce prices in 2008 from 19 to 20 percent reflects the indirect effects of the higher oil prices in this projection  we continue to believe that the passthrough of energy prices is small but not zero  the other major influences on our price projection have remained relatively tame  although the exchange value of the dollar has fallen a bit global prices for nonoil commodities have revised down as well leaving the forecast for core nonoil import prices roughly unchanged  increases in labor compensation remain subdued  and taken as a whole readings on inflation expectations have not changed much  the michigan survey measures of inflation expectations are up some the survey of professional forecasters was flat and inflation compensation as inferred from tips has edged down slightly  with some slack emerging in labor and product markets in the second half of next year and with energy and import prices projected to decelerate we are forecasting a slight drop in core price inflation from its projected pace of 2 percent this year and next to 19 percent in 2009
in contemplating our forecast you might be concerned that our relatively benign muddlethrough scenario is increasingly looking like the average of two considerably less benign outcomesone in which the economy proves considerably more resilient growth bounces back more quickly and inflation picks up by more than we are projecting and another in which we drop below stall speed and the economy experiences outright recession  while i would readily acknowledge those risks i still see something like our forecast as the more plausible outcome at this point  at the september meeting i quoted from the greenbook of march 1999 in which we had raised the white flag of surrender on our story that the financial turbulence of the autumn of 1998 would significantly restrain the growth of the economy  we could be making that mistake again but it seems less likely to me now  in particular one important feature of the episode of the late 1990s was that we were almost immediately fighting the incoming data much of which came in well above our expectations over the final months of 1998 and early 1999  by contrast as i have noted today the recent data seem to be lining up comfortably with our projection of slower growth ahead  i also noted in september the possibility that we could be facing a situation similar to the fall of 2000 when we were forecasting a period of muddling through but were in fact on the brink of a mild recession  again this possibility certainly cant be ruled out  but here as well there are some noteworthy differences from that earlier episode  in particular through the fall of 2000 we were receiving increasingly grim stories especially from manufacturers about the dismal state of order books and a sharp shift in business psychology  at the time we didnt have the conviction to embrace those anecdotes given the strength of the official data ill be interested to hear your reports today but my sense is that the anecdotes from
businesses while mixed are not sharply at variance with the data at present  both seem to be pointing to slower growth but not to a serious retrenchment in activity for these reasons we are inclined to stick with our muddlethrough story for now nathan will continue our presentation
mr sheets  our reading of the recent data suggests that economic activity abroad decelerated toward the end of the third quarter and has remained on a decelerating path thereafter  in the euro area the united kingdom and canada this softening of activity appears to reflectat least in partincreasing drag from the ongoing financial turmoil  notably in the euro area business and consumer confidence have weakened some in recent months pmis for both the services and manufacturing sectors have declined and recent readings on retail sales and industrial production have softened  in the united kingdom indicators of sentiment and retail sales also have slipped of late and a slowdown in the housing sector is now under waywith declines in net mortgage lending mortgage approvals and major indexes of house prices  in response the bank of england late last week cut its key policy rate 25 basis points to 5 percent  the bank of canada also lowered its policy rate a notch last week citing concerns about financial market turmoil
in assessing the impact of the financial turbulence we continue to see little evidence that the emergingmarket economies are being significantly affected  over the past month or so debt spreads for many of these economies have risen and their equity markets have given back some ground but these moves are relatively mild when viewed from a longerterm perspective  all told foreign growth is projected to step down from an average rate of nearly 4 percent during the first three quarters of this year to below 3 percent in the current quarter and early next year  in addition to headwinds from the financial turmoil this slowing reflects policy actions in some countries particularly china to rein in abovetrend growth as well as the softer pace of activity in the united states  thereafter we see foreign growth rising back to a rate of 3 percent  this outlook is weaker over the next few quarters than in our october projection in line with the lower us forecast  in addition given the renewed market turbulence we now see the drag from financial developments as likely to be larger and more protracted than we had previously assumed  we continue to believe that these effects will be felt mainly in the advanced economies but an important downside risk to our forecast is the possibility that the emergingmarket economies may be more affected than we now expect  on friday we received revised japanese gdp data for the third quarter  the latest estimate cuts growth in the quarter to 15 percent at an annual rate down 1 percentage point from the initial reading  notably this growth can be attributed entirely to net exports as domestic demand contracted for the second consecutive quarter  residential investment plunged in the third quarter as new building regulations temporarily weighed on spending  our forecast calls for domestic demand to bounce back quickly but downside risks are increasingly evident for example the profitability of small and mediumsized companies has recently deteriorated labor market conditions seem to be softening and wages continue to contract
the spot price of west texas intermediate approached 100 per barrel in late november but mounting concerns about the nearterm outlook for global activity have since pushed the price back below 90 per barrel  at that level spot wti is down a few dollars per barrel since the last fomc meeting  continued concerns about the longerterm supplydemand balance however have kept the farfutures price at its latenovember level near 87 per barrelup about 7 since the last fomc meeting  nonfuel commodity prices fell sharply in the third quarter and have continued on a downward trajectory  the prices of copper and nickel have plunged driven by concerns that rising inventories may signal a softening of global demand for these commodities  the price of zinc has fallen as well  notably however the prices of food commodities including wheat corn and soybeans have continued to rise
this runup in food prices coupled with high oil prices has stoked inflation in a number of countries  for example in the euro area twelvemonth headline inflation has jumped from 17 percent in august to 3 percent in november led by food and energy prices thus prompting the ecb to leave policy on hold at its meeting last week  going forward this rise in inflation may continue to limit the ecbs willingness to ease policy as fallout from the financial turmoil weighs on activity  in the united kingdom however a recent rebound in inflation to slightly above the bank of englands 2 percent targetdriven in part by rising food pricesdid not deter last weeks policy move  indeed in cutting rates the boe noted that higher energy and food prices are expected to keep inflation above the target in the short term  in china food price inflation is running at more than 15 percent and has pushed overall inflation to 69 percent in november  the pace of inflation has elicited a range of policy responses from the authorities including a move over the weekend to further increase reserve requirements  our forecast sees global food and oil prices soon leveling off in line with quotes from futures markets and this would contribute to a welcome moderation of inflationary pressures in a number of countries
since the last fomc meeting the dollar has strengthened on balance rising
1 percent on average against the major currencies and  percent in broad nominal terms  notwithstanding this reprieve from dollar depreciation we continue to see the current account deficitwhich still exceeds 5 percent of gdpas a key factor that is likely to weigh on the exchange rate going forward  thus our forecast incorporates some modest further real depreciation of the dollar  notably this depreciation comes entirely against our emergingmarket trading partners and we have slightly raised our projections for the pace at which the renminbi and several other emerging asian currencies appreciate against the dollar
i conclude with a few words about the us external sector  we expect that export growth following its redhot 19 percent performance in the third quarter will moderate to a stillstrong pace of around 7 percent in the current quarter and through the next two years as exports are supported by past declines in the dollar and still solid foreign activity  import growth in the current quarter will be sustained at its
moderate thirdquarter rate by a seasonal rebound in oil imports but import growth is expected to fall off during the first half of next year in line with the softer pace of
us activity  thereafter imports are projected to gradually accelerate as growth in the united states firms  all told we see net exports making positive arithmetic contributions to growth of 01 percentage point in the fourth quarter of this year
05 percentage point in 2008 and a little over 01 percentage point in 2009  that concludes our prepared remarks and we are happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  are there questions  president
fisher
mr fisher  actually mr chairman i have a statement disguised as a question
laughter  i am glad on the international side that we raised the issue of food price inflation not
because it is on the cover of the economist but because we discussed it at our last meeting
what is curious to me david is that there is only one line on page 13 of the greenbook  it says
at the same time agricultural producers are expected to step up output of farm products and
that should help bring consumer food price inflation more in line with core inflation  my
statement is that given our communication exercise we are drawing more attention to headline
pce  my question is do i understand it correctly that the food weight in the pce is twice that
of energy and in the cpi is 1 times that of energy  therefore why are we not talking about
food price inflation as it affects headline inflation numbers and why do we spend so much time
on energy relative to food  that is my question  or are we just not worried about food  the
second questionby the way on the international side as well as the domestic sideis what is
the basis for our optimism that food prices will come down against the background of the
demand that you have described on the international side  thank you
mr stockton  food is important  in fact we devote i would imagine a surprising
amount of resources to it  we have an agricultural economist whose job is to follow those
developments and report on them  it is his viewand based on both the futures prices and some
of the modeling that we have donethat we will see a deceleration going forward in retail food
prices  as you know futures prices basically are projecting a flatteningout  i assume that is
part of what is in nathans forecast as well  we are not trying to outguess the markets in that
regard and the reports that we have received on agricultural production look relatively favorable
for the coming year  now most of that is a bit of winter wheat at this point and not much more
in terms of production although we have seen some significant rebuilding of both flocks and
livestock herds that suggests that we are on the right track in terms of an output response to the
higher prices that we have seen in the past year  markets are tight and i think there probably is
some asymmetry in the risk surrounding the food price forecast in that it is easier to see some
possibility of stockout problems if there is any shortfall in production over the coming year
than that there would be some massive boom in agricultural production that will depress prices
sharply  but i do thinkand in the greenbook part 2 quite often especially in the autumn when
we are actually doing a more careful accounting of the harvestwe devote a fair amount of
attention to resources to it  we can certainly do even more going forward
mr fisher  thank you
mr sheets  just to underscore what dave has said our forecast is driven largely from
the quotes from futures markets  so really the question boils down to why in the world do the
futures markets expect the prices of these foodstuffs to decline  i think a key factor is that there
are some important temporary developments that have driven up food prices  there have been
adverse weather conditions in a number of asian economies  for example in china they had
floods earlier this year that have significantly driven up vegetable prices  in addition there has
been a sustained drought in australia that has driven up wheat prices significantly  it has been
several years that we have seen these drought conditions in australia  it is an open issue as to
whether that goes away in 2008 or 2009 but the expectation is that at some point that is going to
abate somewhat
so we can point to temporary factors  there has also been a significant imprint on the
food prices of a move to ethanol in the united states and that has driven up the price of corn  at
the same time some acreage that had been in soybeans has shifted to corn and that has reduced
the supply of soybeans and driven up that price as well  but it is our view and i think the view of
the futures markets that over time you are going to see some of these effects balanced out and
the acreage production will be distributed in a way that will help bring these prices down  in
addition you could get more acres brought into production of these foodstuffs
the final point that i want to emphasize here is that there are also some important
structural factors that are driving up food prices two that i think are worth mentioning  one is
that you have a lot of people in these emergingmarket economies who are a lot wealthier than
they were ten years ago and they want to eat better and the world is going to have to find a way
to produce more and higherquality agricultural goods  it is imaginable that there will be some
upward pressure on price through that transition  the second important factor that i think is
structural is we have seen a sustained and now an apparently permanent increase in the price of
oil  it takes a lot of petroleum to produce these goods so that is a longerrun factor that may
contribute to higher agricultural prices
mr fisher  thank you for your thorough answer
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thanks  dave i have two questions i suppose  the first one is that the
greenbook gdp forecast has come down a good bit since october  at the same time the
greenbookconsistent shortrun equilibrium real funds rate was revised down  percentage
point  how much independent information is there between these two observations  i mean the
equilibrium real funds rate is the rate which if maintained for some period of time would get us
back up to potential growth  so the fact that you have marked that down suggests that you
would have a lower real rate  the second question is this  we were expecting the economy to
slow during the current period  expectations of slowing versus slowing that is revealed in the
data are very important for how we think about the outlookmaybe you said this but i dont
recall it  could you give me an idea of how in the greenbook your assumptions have evolved
since october with regard to prospective losses due to mortgage foreclosures and the write
downs that the banks are expected to take or have announced on this  do you have some
numbers in mind on how things have changed in that regard and how that might be influencing
your housing outlook  thank you
mr stockton  in response to your first question about whether there is independent
information in that estimate of the equilibrium funds rate for the greenbookconsistent measure the
answer is that there is no independent information  its just a transformation of the revision in the
gdp outlook into interest rate space  now obviously we provide a few other measures in that
table some based on a largescale econometric model and some on smallerscale models  those
have come down too  so i dont think our forecast is doing something different from well what
those other models suggest  in response to your second question our forecast of housing activity
going forward is not driven by the foreclosures  the foreclosure forecast that we have is driven
importantly by the houseprice developments and there we have marked down our houseprice
forecast  we would expect some increase in foreclosures and obviously that would have some
feedback on overall lending and conditions of bank balance sheets
in general since the october forecast we have built in more broadly about  percentage
point to the level of gdp in additional restraint on spending coming from the increased overall
financial turmoilnot just in the housing markets but weve taken down a little our forecast of
consumption and our forecast of business fixed investment too  basically looking at the past
correlation between measures of overall financial stress and the residuals of our spending equations
theres considerable correlation there  that is our standard models as i noted in the past have very
rudimentary financial transmission mechanisms in themmostly a few interest rates a few asset
prices housing equity and the exchange rate  in the past periods when weve seen significant
increase in financial stress have also been associated with significant shortfalls in spending and
weve tried as best we can to build that in  most of that effect overall is in housingover half of
itbut some of it we think will spill over elsewhere  those bank balance sheets are going to be
impaired  we think there will be some restraint on lending going forward  but boy its a lot of
guess work  on the housing side i do think we can go through morecareful calculations of the
implications of the shutdown of the nonprime market and the current impairment in the jumbo
markets but beyond that id say were very loosely calibrating it
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  dave i want to lump together all the various forms of financial distress
herethe mortgage market auto loans credit card loans and maybe even business failures  if my
memory serves correctly and it may well not if we look at the history of business cycle
fluctuations all those different forms of financial distress rise after a business cycle peak when we
have increases in unemployment and actual declines in gdp  assuming that we are not after a
business cycle peak right now it appears that we have a great deal of financial distress ahead of
im hoping it remains ahead ofa business cycle peak  so this is a very atypical situation in the
context of us business cycle history
mr stockton  i dont actually know in terms of the lag between financial stress and
activity  they look very contemporaneous in many cases and in some cases obviously they are
past leading indicators of economic activity such as the stockwatson index which ultimately
didnt work all that great but for a while it looked as though various quality spreads and term
spreads had some leading indicator value  so im not totally sure about whether or not this looks
incredibly unusual in that the stress might have increased
mr poole  im talking particularly about the delinquencies foreclosures and business
failures because i think that they usually occur on the way down during the contraction phase of the
business cycle and ordinarily those measures look their best close to a business cycle peak  thats
what i remember but i havent gone back and reviewed it but from just my memory of looking at a
lot of business cycle data over the years  that would say that if my observation is correct this is
quite an unusual situationunless of course we are past the peak or right at the peak
mr stockton  this is obviously a situation in which in some sense the financial
stress is the shock to the system rather than the endogenous response to some other shock either an
aggressive tightening of policy or some other type of aggregate demand shock  so in that sense this
particular configuration i think sort of fits with the situation were currently facing  obviously
were not forecasting a business cycle peak  so in our forecast were not yet saying that were on
the downside of a business cycle  we have a growth recession in this forecast and nothing more
than that  if we were to get a true cyclical downturn i think you could obviously expect that to have
some very considerable effects on foreclosures business failures and so forth that channel or
mechanism would amplify the downturn in this particular episode
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  dave im having difficulty reconciling the employment and hours data for
the current quarter with your forecast of no growth whatsoever  it seems to me that even if
domestic final demand doesnt grow or grows little we still have inventories and exports that could
take up whatever output turns out to be and we dont know very much about those two components
for the current quarter if i understand the situation right  alternatively obviously you can get a
very bad productivity number and that would square the circle  but im wondering what we know
in particular about inventories and exports that would lead us to something as weak as this forecast
mr stockton  in the forecast in fact we do square the labor market with our forecast
of weak gdp with basically flat labor productivity  now thats coming on the heels of a quarter in
which we had a 6 percent increase in nonfarm business labor productivity  thats a huge gap and i
dont think in some sense that the level of productivity that were forecasting here is at all at odds
with the basic trend that weve been seeing  now when you ask me what we know about
inventories and net exports ill let nathan speak to the net export side of things  on inventories we
know virtually nothing at this point and this forecast is actually predicated on nonmotorvehicle
inventory investment stepping up  we have some offset in some sense built into this forecast on the
nonmotorvehicle side that there will be some we think unintended accumulation of inventories
in the fourth quarter  obviously the standard error around our forecast is very large and it includes
much higher numbers on inventories which if that were to be the case would obviously not bode
well for activity going forward because we certainly dont see inventories currently as so lean that
they need to be rebuilt  as i indicated on the final sales side at this point we do have i think
enough data in hand to make us pretty comfortable with the notion that theres going to be a
considerable slowing in final demand in the current quarter  nathan do you want to say anything
mr sheets  yes just to echo what dave said we have very little hard data so far
essentially no hard data for net exports for q4  we will be receiving the october trade data later
this week  so at that point well start getting a bit more insight into it  that said we see the
contribution from net exports falling off from a substantial 14 percentage points in q3 to just a
touch above 01 in q4 and thats driven by a moderation in export growth and continued 4 percent
import growth  but obviously theres a lot of uncertainty around those projections
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have sort of a longerrun question that id
like to pose  i was looking at the alternative scenarios in the greenbook and one of the things that i
was looking at was the funds rate path that was described as the marketbased forecast for the funds
rate  it drops almost 150 basis points or 100plus basis points between now and the middle or end
of next year  one consequence of that though seems pretty benignthat theres not much change
in the inflation forecast at least through 2009 it changes only about 01 percentage pointand there
are some positive effects on output particularly in 09  it appears at least within this period that
100 basis point rate cuts seemed to be pretty much free  so i guess my question to the staff is is
there a price to be paid for that and if i run the forecast out beyond 2009 will any of those prices or
those consequences appear in the forecast for inflation  if so how long would i have to look before
i saw them in the model
mr stockton  i dont think youd need to look much farther than the horizon that
were showing here to see that in the context of the staffs view about activity that path for the fed
funds rate would probably not be sustainable because in some sense our is curve is considerably
stronger than the markets currently  if it makes you feel a little better we are planning on
incorporating the extended forecast into the greenbook next time and we want to take these
alternative scenarios and push them out because we recognize that one of the weaknesses in the
relatively short period that we have here is that much of the interesting action in these often takes
place just beyond the time frame that were showing  so i think that will help
mr plosser  i appreciate that  that would be very helpful to put in some perspective
what tradeoff in the costs we might see  thank you
mr stockton  we should make some progress there
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you  my first question is an extension of
president evanss question  dave there are two things to your monetary policy assumption in the
greenbook  one is that you lowered the path 50 basis points over the forecast period but the way
you did it was sort of interesting  you did 25 now and you did the rest just at the point where i
think in your forecast the economy is coming back up toward trend growth  can you say a little
about the shape of that path
mr stockton  yes  in some sense that reduction in the middle of 2009 goes back to
president plossers point  were trying to get on track so that when we actually show the extended
greenbook we have been following roughly speaking the optimal control simulation on a 1
percent inflation target  the 25 basis points up front is in some sense dealing with the current
weakness in overall activity  the 25 basis points in 2009 really reflects the fact that at that point
inflation is coming down a little and youve opened up an output gap  you have an unemployment
rate at 5 percent and you can start a process then according to that optimal control of lowering the
real funds rate to encourage growth to move above potential and eventually reduce the
unemployment rate back toward the nairu  i recognize its going to be a cosmetici mean not a
cosmetic but a small analytical wrinklethat might be more confusing than enlightening  but as
you know in the greenbook extension memo that we circulate we do see the fed funds rate coming
down to 4 percent or below in the extended greenbook part  so it really is more to try to stimulate
growth to above potential once you have inflation moving down
vice chairman geithner  may i ask one followup question  in the note for the
board that you circulated on monday dave you said that the magnitude of the credit crunch youre
contemplating is roughly comparable to the unusual weakness of private spending seen during the
headwinds episode of the early 1990s  so i was curious  it is sort of interesting because you think
that capital at banks going into this period is much stronger than going into the 199091 period
corporate balance sheets based just on the crude leverage ratios are much healthier today than they
were then  on the other hand banks are a smaller share of the financial system and you could say
that the nonbank part looks kind of weak  the fhlb is growing very dramatically taking up a fair
amount of the room left by the shrinking of the nonbank sector  i dont know  gses have less
room to grow  its sort of mixed  its complicated  i was curious about how you thought about the
comparison  you didnt seem to like the comparison
mr stockton  so the headwinds of the 199091 periodthat was a calibration we
used for the credit crunch scenario in the greenbook
vice chairman geithner  oh its just the alternative scenario  i misunderstood
im sorry
mr stockton  in our baseline forecast we dont have what i would call a real credit
crunch  we have some tightening of terms and standards in a period of financial stress that we think
will depress spending  but if youre really thinking that we are on the verge of something that looks
more like the 199091 period then i think that credit crunch scenario gives you a better sense of the
dimensions of the demand shock  now as we discussed at the board meeting yesterday and
governor kroszner suggested we might want to think about elongating that particular shock  we
piled a big shock into a relatively short time and certainly another reasonable alternativeif you
were in a situation like thatwould be that you would face a longer period of weak demand but not
necessarily that sort of recessionary type of scenario that we showed there
chairman bernanke  other questions  president evans
mr evans  as i was looking at the alternative simulations and the credit crunch scenario
and trying to make sense of what financial markets are thinking about in terms of the expected fed
funds rate path it seems as though you need that credit crunch scenario to get to that type of path
and thats not where you are  then there are also other scenarios that are slightly stronger which i
think are in line with more blue chip types of forecasts too  so there really is a disconnect in a lot
of this
mr stockton  well i think as we showed in the alternative scenarios something like
either the credit crunch or the greater housing correction scenariosin the real world obviously
wouldnt necessarily be shocks that would be independent of each otherbut either one of those
two scenarios is constructed to produce something that looks similar to what the markets might be
thinking  and we dont think those scenarios are unreasonable
chairman bernanke  all right  president hoenig
mr hoenig  david in listening to this i have a question  as you are looking at and
projecting forward were talking about a fed funds rate path that comes down and yet weve talked
a great deal about inflation rising temporarily in some views  the question i have is does it give
you pause  how do you analyze the risk that you are lowering rates in an environment of rising
inflation on a global basis  do you have any concerns about the risk  are you reevaluating the risk
of how stable inflationary expectations might be in that scenario
mr stockton  obviously in our baseline forecast we dont really have a pickup of
inflation even headline inflation beyond the very near term  so we do think that in the next
quarter or two were going to be looking at some pretty large headline numbers that will be
reflecting the jump in energy prices and some lingering increases in food prices
mr hoenig  right and youre saying the slowdown in the economy makes that
temporary
mr stockton  the slowdown in the economy helps in the sense that we do think
opening up an output gap is going to limit and eventually bring down some of those inflation
pressures  in terms of the risks surrounding the forecast i think an important element in the
baseline forecast is that taking on futures markets for both energy and foodand those markets are
expecting almost an immediate flatteningout and even oil prices coming down just a bitis
probably more important in some sense over the next year or so in terms of relieving inflation
pressures  certainly our experience in the past several years is that we dont know any better way to
do it  its not as though the futures markets have done a great job for us theyve always been
forecasting that things were going to be flattening out right around the corner  so if you were
skeptical about whether that was going to occur you might be concerned about whether or not you
could experience some continued upside surprises there  now weve been encouraged in looking at
inflation expectations because we havent yet seen any really broadbased deterioration and we
think things have to date been reasonably well contained  in our forecast that continues  this
forecast does not assume that there will be any deterioration of inflation expectations going forward
if we saw that it would be at odds with what were seeing now and would probably lead us to
revise up the forecast
mr hoenig  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  lets begin our goround  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  at the time of our last meeting i held out
hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without
serious damage  subsequent developments have severely shaken that belief  the bad news since
our last meeting has grown steadier and louder as strains in financial markets have resurfaced
and intensified and as the economy has shown clear signs of faltering  in addition the downside
threats to growth that then seemed to be tail events now appear to be much closer to the center of
the distribution  i found little to console me in the greenbook  like the board staff i have
significantly marked down my growth forecast  the possibilities of a credit crunch developing
and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real
conditions in financial markets have worsened  rates on a wide array of loans and
securities have increased significantly since our last meeting including those on term
commercial paper term libor prime jumbo mortgages and highyield corporate bonds  cds
spreads from major financial institutions with significant mortgage exposure including freddie
and fannie have risen appreciably  in addition broad stock indexes are down nearly 5 percent
at the same time measures of implied volatility in equity bond and foreign exchange markets
have all moved up reflecting the greater uncertainty about the economys direction
the most recent data on spending have been discouraging as well  data on house sales
prices and construction have been downbeat and foreclosures on subprime loans have moved
even higher  even with efforts such as those facilitated by the administration to freeze subprime
rates foreclosures look to rise sharply next year which may dump a large number of houses on a
market already swamped with supply  this will exacerbate the downward pressure on house
prices and new home construction from already elevated home inventories  indeed the tencity
caseshiller homeprice index has declined more than 5 percent over the past year through
september and futures contracts point to another sizable decline over the next twelve months
i am particularly concerned that we may now be seeing the first signs of spillovers from
the housing and financial sectors to the broader economy  although the job market has remained
reasonably healthy so far real consumer spending in september and october was dead in the
water and households are growing more pessimistic about future prospects  the december
reading of consumer sentiment showed another decline and the cumulative falloff in this
measure is becoming alarming  gains in disposable income have been weakened  with
consumer sentiment in the doldrums house prices on the skids and energy prices on the rise
consumer spending looks to be quite subdued for some time  this view is echoed by the ceo of
a national highend clothing retailer on our board who recently emphasized to us that the
positive chain store sales data in november were in fact artificially boosted by the thanksgiving
calendar shift and that the underlying trend for his business has worsened notably
my modal forecast foresees the economy barely managing to avoid recession with
growth essentially zero this quarter and about 1 percent next quarter  i expect growth to remain
below potential throughout next year causing the unemployment rate to rise to about 5 percent
much like in the greenbook  this forecast assumes a 50 basis point decline in the federal funds
rate in the near future placing the real funds rate near the center of the range of estimates of the
neutral rate reported in the bluebook  i should emphasize that i do not place a lot of confidence
in this forecast and in particular i fear that we are in danger of sliding into a credit crunch
such an outcome is illustrated by the credit crunch alternative simulation in the greenbook
although i dont foresee conditions in the banking sector getting as bleak as during the credit
crunch of the early 1990s the parallels to those events are striking  back then we saw a large
number of bank failures in the contraction of the savings and loan sector  in the current
situation most banks are still in pretty good shape  instead it is the shadow banking sector
that is the set of markets in which a variety of securitized assets are financed by the issuance of
commercial paperthat is where the failures have occurred  this sector is all but shut for new
business
but bank capital is also an issue  until the securitization of nonconforming mortgage
lending reemerges financing will depend on the willingness and ability of banks thrifts and the
gses to step in to fill the breach  to the extent they do that will put further pressure on their
capital which is already under some pressure from writedowns on existing loans and holdings
of assets  banks are showing increasing concern that their capital ratios will become binding and
are tightening credit terms and conditions  several developments suggest to me that this
situation could worsen  in addition to the problems plaguing the adjustablerate subprime
mortgages delinquencies have recently started to move up more broadlyon credit card and
auto loans adjustablerate prime mortgages and fixedrate subprime mortgages  my contacts at
large district banks tell me that because the economy continues to be reasonably healthy and
people have jobs things are still under control  but if house prices and the stock market fall
further and the economy appears to be weakening then they will further tighten the lending
conditions and terms on consumer loans to avoid problems down the road and these fears could
be selffulfilling  if banks only partially replace the collapsed shadow banks or worse if they
cut back their lending in anticipation of a worsening economy then the resulting credit crunch
could push us into recession  this possibility is presumably increasingly reflected in cds and
lowgrade corporate bond spreads  thus the risk of recession no longer seems remote
especially since the economy may well already have begun contracting in the current quarter
indeed the december blue chip consensus puts the odds of a recession at about 40 percent
this estimate is within the range of recession probabilities computed by my staff using models
based on the yield curve and other variables
turning to inflation data on the core measure continues to be favorable  wage growth
remains moderate and the recent downward revisions to hourly compensation have relieved
some worries there  inflation expectations remain contained  as i mentioned i expect some
labor market slack to develop and this should offset any in my view modest inflationary
pressures from past increases in energy and import prices and help keep core pce price inflation
below 2 percent  continued increases in energy and import prices pose some upside risk to the
inflation outlook but there are also downside risks to inflation associated with a weakening
economy and rising unemployment
to sum up i believe that the most likely outcome is for the economy to slow
significantly in the near term flirting with recession and i view the risk to that scenario as being
weighted significantly to the downside  in contrast i expect inflation to remain well contained
and i view those risks as fairly balanced
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i think i took the same pessimism pill
as president yellen this morning  the greenbook makes very somber reading and i would
make several observations about the forecast it provides  first greenbook forecasts of two
successive quarters of growth below 1 percent are quite rare and often in the past have occurred
shortly before or during recessions  second the 70 percent confidence interval for the
greenbook projection of gdp using historical forecast errors has a negative lower bound
third i would note that when the unemployment rate rises at least  percent it tends to rise
much further than just  percent  that is historically when we have unemployment rates rise
 percent we have subsequently found ourselves in a recession  these observations indicate
that while a recession is not forecast in the greenbookas david has been careful to statethe
probability of a recession is clearly elevated
at our last meeting the housing market was very soft but weakness in other components
was not yet reflected in the data  but now we have some evidence that consumption and
investment may also be slowing and residential investment may be even weaker than we
thought  while incoming data have generally been weak some higherfrequency data like the
recent labor report might be consistent with a stronger outlook than the greenbook forecast
however i am concerned that housing prices may actually fall more than assumed in the
greenbook potentially resulting in consequences that are difficult to forecast with models using
only postwar data  i am also sympathetic to the view that disruptions in financial flows have the
potential to result in significantly more weakness than would result from an econometric model
that does not capture significant liquidity disruptions in part because the occurrence of such
events is quite rare  added to these concerns is the current state of financial markets both here
and abroad  the elevated rates for term lending even over relatively short maturities indicates
significant risk aversion by market participants  financial institutions with very low
probabilities of default as measured by credit default swap rates are nonetheless having
difficulty securing term lending over yearend
bank supervisors of large financial institutions are beginning to report correlations in
nonperforming experiences of auto credit card and mortgage loans  geographic regions hard
hit by mortgage defaults are also experiencing rising default rates in other types of loans
portfolios that are not highly correlated during good times can become highly correlated during
bad times and the initial trends being reported in bank supervision are not encouraging  i would
also highlight this as one of the instances in which bank supervision is providing some very
relevant input into thinking about the macroeconomy
finally i would highlight several institutional concerns that could have broader
implications  first financial guarantors as was highlighted earlier have credit default swap
rates inconsistent with their aaa rating  significant downgrades would further depress cdos
but also disrupt the municipal bond market and force some banks to fulfill agreements to
purchase securities that do not maintain at least an aa rating  second there is the potential for
significant further announcements of downgrades of assets related to sivs and cdos  money
market funds are currently experiencing inflows  however those flows could quickly reverse if
investors lose confidence in their ability to redeem money market funds at par  third i would
note that for securities like lowergrade bonds that have not previously shown elevated risk
premiums those premiums are now becoming quite elevated providing evidence that what was
initially a liquidity concern is now becoming a more widespread and generalized concern about
the state of the economy
with core inflation a little below 2 percent and future reductions in labor market
pressures likely we have the flexibility to respond aggressively to slowing economic growth and
the ongoing financial turmoil  this seems to be the appropriate time to take significant further
action knowing that should the economy perform much better than we currently anticipate we
could be equally nimble in raising rates as appropriate
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  just before the meeting i learned something
about how we select the order  there are a bunch of us sitting with debbie and most people
seem to want to go toward the end  debbie apparently has been in touch with too many
econometricians because she said it is overdetermined laughter  anyway here i am
let me start with some of the anecdotal reports  it is pretty clear that the anecdotal
reports that i am getting from large national firms on the goods side of the economy are coming
in on the soft side  the holiday season according to ups is coming in about 2 percentage
points below projection and ups and fedex are revising down somewhat their longerterm
projections and their capital spending plans  my fedex contact said that the lessthantruckload
business is in his terms pitiful  my contact with a large trucking company jbhunt said that
the company is cutting its capacity  its volume is down 13 percent from a year ago  the
company has reduced capacity 13 percent over the past twelve months and will cut another 12
percent  that is after all a full onequarter cut in capacity of that company  hunt is selling its
trucks  many of them are going to russia interestingly enough  perhaps the only good news
from this company is that drivers are plentifully available which has not been so true in the past
in the quickserve restaurant business there is a ray of hope  the projection is that food prices
will increase much more modestly than they have been doing this year but they said that most
people in the restaurant business are pessimistic  on the other hand a large software company
reports that it is optimistic  the sales of pcs are good gaming devices and software are doing
well and capex plans are substantialnothing being cut back there  a contact with a large
money center bank said that the banks analysis of its consumer credit card business indicated
that the increase in thirtyday delinquencies is entirely explained by what is going on in florida
california and nevada and delinquencies in the rest of the country are about unchanged
a general comment on the business outlook  we have a lot of specific newsand
certainly janet talked about some of thatthat is pretty negative  i have an inherent optimism
about the economy which is hard to put any real flesh on the bones i guess but i think that the
economy in the longer run is inherently strong and resilient  a lot of the adjustments in the
credit markets i believe are under way  we see it with a lot of the recapitalizations that are
taking place and the initial shock back in july and august  there are a lot of smart people with
sharp pencils who are digging into their situations deciding what to write off and then getting
on with things and they are past the initial scramble  so those things together give me some
sense of optimism  i would also note that although many households are certainly stressed
there does seem to be a lot of discretionary spending taking placeconsumer electronics for
example are pretty strong  there was an article in the newspaper noting that the hot items this
christmas season are gps navigation devices  to add one of these to your car hardly seems to
be an essential expenditure  computer games are another example
mr mishkin  talk for yourself bill  laughter
mr poole  i bought my gps a long time ago and i dont play computer games  but
at any rate flat panel tvs a lot of stuff like that suggest that many households are not on the
edge of being highly stressed  so i dont know where to come out on this  i guess that my
outlook has more variance to it than usual and it seems to me that when we get to the policy
discussion what we need to do is to find a way to react promptly to the surprises that i think are
inevitably ahead of us  thank you
chairman bernanke  is the sale of a used truck to russia an export or a capital
inflow  laughter  think about that one
mr poole  well it is not current production so it is not an export
chairman bernanke  no i understand  lets see  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  economic conditions in the fifth district
appear to be generally sound but with some notable areas of weakness  our survey readings on
the services firms indicate continued moderate growth in november and our index of
manufacturing activity gained a few points following a sharp decline in october though it
remains in neutral territory  a number of our contacts reported that the weaker dollar is
providing a boost to manufacturing exports and i have noticed a definite increase in the number
of coal trains rumbling by my office on their way from west virginia to port  on the other hand
our merchant contacts were much less optimistic about their sales prospects going into the
holiday season  our retail sales survey indicator slid another 8 points pulled down by
significant declines in big ticket sales and shopper traffic components  district housing markets
continue to weaken overall with distinctly morepessimistic tones in some markets particularly
around the dc area although there are a couple of areas that are still reporting decent activity
to the south
in commercial real estate reports from the retail and industrial markets are generally
upbeat  one former director whose firm owns a sizable portfolio of retail properties throughout
the east coast described the sector as in the best shape he has seen in his lifetime and he is by
no means a young man  industrial leasing appears to be in good shape even tight in some
markets  in the office market however contacts in maryland and the carolinas report slower
office leasing activity in october and early november
the community bankers i have talked with say that portfolios are still quite clean but that
they are scrutinizing deals much more carefully in the current environment  they also complain
that large banks are raising deposit rates and competing more intensely for deposits  at large
banks the cost of capital has increased and they are responding accordingly by reevaluating the
profitability of various lines of business  this does not appear to have resulted in any wholesale
cutback in lending but more in a tightening of terms in selected market segments
i view the information from our district as fairly consistent with my economic outlook at
the national level  housing investment continues to contract and the overhang of unsold homes
and general tightening of credit terms suggest a quite prolonged period of relatively depressed
activity  consumer spending clearly has slowed  for the months of september and october real
consumption showed almost no growth  while early reports on the holiday shopping season are
notoriously slippery it seems clear that shoppers are far from ebullient perhaps with the
exception of these gps toys  this seems consistent with the virtual absence of growth in real
disposable income over the past two months and the flatteningout of household net worth in the
third quarter  job growth has shifted down to a more modest pace over this year and revisions to
the payroll series when we finally get them seem likely to make the slowdown look bigger  so
it wouldnt surprise me if consumer spending came in fairly tame next year  i am expecting a
slowdown in consumer spending growth however not a sharp pullback  labor markets are still
fairly tight  household net worth is still at fairly elevated levels  so while the increase in the
saving rate projected by the greenbook for next year is plausible i think consumer spending
could come out on the high side of that forecast
a key factor in the outlook and a key source of uncertainty is the continuing drama in
credit markets  large banks are bringing impaired assets onto their balance sheets and are facing
a higher cost of capital and increased funding costs  it would seem reasonable to expect them to
respond by tightening terms of credit for households and business borrowers implying a further
drag on spending  the magnitude of this sort of fallout is still quite uncertain  reduced credit
flows appear so far to be less a reduction in credit supply than in demand  that is they appear to
reflect a genuine deterioration in borrower creditworthiness in some segments  residential real
estate fits this description as does some though not all commercial real estate  beyond these
sectors we have seen some evidence of yield spreads widening but the cost of credit to
investmentgrade nonfinancial firms is low and has been falling along with the riskfree rate at
least until very recently  the flow of credit to such firms seems to have been holding up well as
has the nonmortgage consumer credit flow  so at this point it does not look as though an
indiscriminate acrosstheboard credit crunch is taking place although marginally higher credit
costs may exert some additional drag on spending growth  overall then i do see a weaker
outlook for growth in the near term and the timing of the return to trend is going to depend
somewhat on the bottomingout of the housing cycle which unfortunately appears to be getting
even more remote each time we meet
if we have a more protracted slowdown ahead of us as seems likely now we need to be
careful not to lose sight of inflation  core pce inflation has edged up over the past two months
and it now appears likely to move above 2 percent for a time  overall inflation of course has
been higher on average over the last year and we have seen a slight upward trend in fiveyear
forward inflation compensation since earlier in the year  in fact the behavior of energy and food
prices over the past several years calls into question the standard presumption we make that
overall inflation is going to return to the core inflation trend in a reasonable period of time  that
points to the possibility that inflation may give us more trouble ahead
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  coming out of our october meeting i
expected a period of subpar growth stretching into the middle of 2008  since i was anticipating
some soft data it was not obvious to me that the outlook had worsened until later in the
intermeeting period  a lot of the data that we have cited are financial items that are difficult to
assess and are somewhat unusual for the current period  but the incoming information has
caused us to mark down our outlook further although we dont see growth declining as far
below potential as in the greenbook baseline forecast  although housing continues to weaken
that by itself did not cause a substantial revision to our outlook  the bigger factor was a
noticeable weakening of consumption  pce was basically flat in september and octoberi
guess dead on arrival  the financial headlines are taking their toll on consumer sentiment and
higher energy prices are lowering real incomes
it is not clear however that we are seeing a major sustained pullback in consumption
but of course that is arguable  the limited information we have about novembermotor
vehicle sales and the chain store datasuggest at least modest gains in consumer expenditures  i
realize that the chain store sales could be a bit artificial  i was talking to one of my business
contacts who has a significant presence in retail and i am accustomed to hearing that well the
christmas season is a bit short this year so that could be a problem  but i actually caught him
this time saying gee its so long this time that people seem to be losing interest  laughter
on balance i think the fundamentals for consumption are still reasonably good
importantly although they may be somewhat lagging the payroll numbers are still
consistent with decent growth in wage income and the unemployment rate remains low
elsewhere foreign growth remains good which along with the lower dollar should support
continued growth in exports  we have seen some softening in capital spending as well but the
usual indicators still point to moderate gains in investment  these developments seem
reasonably consistent with what i heard from business contacts  most of them think that growth
is slowing and they are more cautious but i would summarize their views as guarded and not
alarmist  furthermore many say that their improved inventory control methods are preventing
an inventory cycle from exacerbating the current situation and they bring this up without my
prompting  so to me their comments do not yet suggest a sharp curtailment in real economic
activity
of course the financial markets continue to weigh negatively on the outlook  in my
view the biggest concerns are the large markdowns on structured securities and the volume of
assets that may be returning to banks balance sheets  these effects appear to be larger than the
banks had planned for as of october and could have a significant impact on lending capacity
this is an important downside risk to the real economy as the greenbook highlights in many
places  that said when i talk with my business contacts there continues to be a disconnect
between the credit conditions they report facing and the turbulence we see in money and credit
markets  outside of lending for residential and nonresidential construction my ceo contacts at
nonfinancial firms do not report much change in credit costs or availability  we have heard this
from a number of sources  for example two of the larger banks in our district said they have
not changed terms to borrowers and they expressed relatively sanguine views of lending
conditions overall  for the time being some lenders report offsetting a portion of their higher
funding costs by taking a hit on their interest margins
credit conditions for constructionrelated industries are another matter  a major
shopping center developer who has been one of the largest issuers of commercial mortgage
backed securities indicated that this market has dried up completely  however the developer has
been able to obtain financing from other traditional sources such as life insurance companies
he is paying similar interest rates he says but the terms include lower loantovalue ratios  so
there is some credit effect but he still has access for the moment  that is a bit like what
president lacker was suggesting  he said the switch is not a big deal for him currently but if it
continues for too longsay for more than six months or soit would then weigh more heavily
on his business activity  the evolution of such developments will obviously be an important
thing to watch over the next few meetings  i would just note that i dont often look at the duke
university survey of cfos  but as i looked at itand i dont have a great deal of experience
it did seem to indicate that they had higher spending plans on average from their september
survey for capital expenditures and technology spending  it wasnt a great bit but given all the
negative headlines associated with the credit conditionswhich are unweighted whereas these
spending plans are weightedthat was a bit of a surprise
putting all of this together we have marked down our current quarter and 2008 real gdp
forecasts 04 percentage point which is pretty significant  we now have growth next year of
2 percent  we expect growth to improve to our assessment of potential thereafter namely
about 2 percent  this forecast assumes two policy easings similar to but sooner than the
greenbook and it is shaded toward the stronger domestic demand alternative scenario which
has less financial restraint on pce and business fixed investment than in the greenbook baseline
turning to inflation our forecast is for pce inflation to settle in at 18 percent  this
continued favorable projection for inflation is important for my policy views now  we think
resource utilization likely will be about neutral for inflation over this forecast period  our gdp
projection does not result in appreciable resource slack over the forecast period  even under the
weaker greenbook scenario the gdp gap remains less than  percentage point  but there are
upside risks  the most recent data on core prices have been a bit higher  the lower dollar could
put pressure on prices and my business contacts remain concerned about the cost of energy and
other commodities  finally at least by the board staff calculations fiveyear forward tips
inflation compensation has moved up to the range that it was in during the spring of 2006 a
period when we were more concerned about the inflation outlook  i wouldnt put too much
weight on this particular inflation expectation development at the moment but it may be looming
ahead  so i continue to see upside risk to inflation which if realized would complicate our
policy reaction to developments on the growth and employment side of the ledger  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  it probably goes without saying that i think the
main development since the last fomc meting has been the renewed deterioration in some of
the financial markets  in the absence of thatthat is had financial market conditions either
stabilized or continued to improve as they had from the september to october meetingswe
would be probably having a somewhat different conversation this morning  we would be talking
more about parsing the recent incoming macro data and talking about whether the economy was
slowing as anticipated or a little more or a little less  we should remember we were expecting a
significant slowing in the rate of growth and that in fact does seem to be occurring  but as i
said i think the financial market developments have been the dominant ones
as far as the economic outlook is concerned my view of the next few quarters is for
growth a bit better than that in the greenbook for a couple of reasons  one is that i think the
incoming data as always are noisy and i am reluctant to put a lot of weight on them  second it
seems to me that some of the underlying fundamentals particularly the labor market data
present a more favorable picture of the outlook than the spending numbers at the moment  but it
seems to me that the risks are clearly on the downside and they are on the downside because of
financial market conditions  perhaps the most interesting anecdote i came across in the
intermeeting period was that about two weeks ago we had a meeting with about fifteen leaders
from firms in the financial services industry in the twin cities  there was a good deal of
concern among i would say virtually all the participants in that meeting and it wasnt so much
about yearend funding and that kind of thing  it was really about the economic outlook and it
had to do with the fact that some markets are not working or are barely working at the moment
there is no doubt that in their own businesses they are all tightening terms and other conditions
they believe that is appropriate but they wouldnt argue that it isnt going to have an effect on
spending  they also believe that at least some of their customers are acting in anticipation of
that  that is they are starting to cancel or at least delay spending plans believing that they
arent going to be able to find financing or at least find financing at terms they would like  so it
seems to me that we are in an environment as far as financial conditions are concerned where
that poses a very real downside threat to what otherwise might be a pretty acceptable economic
outlook
just a word about inflation  i havent changed my outlook for inflation going forward  i
dont have a sense from the incoming information that there is any compelling reason at the
moment to do so  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the conversations that i have had with my
business contacts indicate that business conditions in our region have clearly softened since the
last meeting and perhaps even more than what is reflected in the beige book report that we
prepared just a few weeks ago  a sense of pessimism about the economic outlook seems once
again to be sweeping over our business community and it is not just the financial community
this is a decided change from what i was hearing in october and is clearly an added threat to our
already fragile outlook  my banking supervision staff reports that the district banks continue to
address the risks in their portfolios by shifting focus away from residential and commercial real
estate and by requiring more collateral stronger covenants and better debtservice coverage in
their deals  but our examiners are not reporting that capital positions of our financial institutions
have been impaired such that they cannot accommodate sound projects  a few of the corporate
cfos i talk with say that credit commitments are more difficult to come by  the ceos of the
fourth district financial institutions advise me that what we are facing is a liquidity squeeze and
not at present a credit crunch  that said these bank ceos have expressed concern that their
capital positions could become impaired if the current pressure for more liquidity forces them to
sell some of their assets at large discounts
the incoming data for the economy appear to be unfolding reasonably close to my
october projection  i was fairly pessimistic about our nearterm growth prospects and that
pessimism seems to have been well founded  so the economic data by themselves havent been
enough to push me off the forecast trajectory that i submitted at our last meeting  but as i noted
earlier i do observe a sharp drop in business confidence across a broad collection of industries
not just those tied to residential real estate  what i am hearing sounds more substantial than the
transitory slowing that i was projecting just six weeks ago  what i am hearing from my business
contacts is probably more aligned with the prolonged slow growth outlook that i now see in the
greenbook baseline or worse  i am somewhat thankful that i didnt have to submit a projection
for this meeting because i am torn between what my mostly datadriven model says and what i
am hearing from my business sources  about the only thing that i can say with much confidence
is that the reemergence of liquidity pressures combined with the deterioration in business
confidence has increased the downside risk to growth  i think it is prudent to address that risk
with our policy decision today but i will hold my comments about our policy moves for later in
the meeting  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i think president stern framed it well in
bringing focus to the effect on our thinking that the financial markets are having  as many have
said the central question is not whether the economy is softening but whether it is softening beyond
the range that underpinned the policy decision in october  id add to that a range of questions
related to financial markets particularly the question of whether the deterioration in the financial
markets changes the prospects for achieving financial stability the potential for spreading to a wider
array of financial markets and institutions the potential for spillover to the general economy and
the compounding of the already heightened degree of uncertainty  all of these weigh heavily on my
thinking  like the greenbook projections atlantas forecast has been revised down as a result of
incoming data since the last meeting  i just point out speaking only for ourselves that these
downward revisions of previous forecasts and our general outlook have been a pattern over recent
months
the current situation is extremely difficult to readwhich is another way of saying that
uncertainty around our forecast has increased yet again  contributing to this uncertainty is the
continuing if not accelerating gap between the anecdotal information and the views ive received
from wall street versus main street  the expectations of financial market participants have
deteriorated and can be characterized as extremely serious  however the message i get from
directors and representatives of nonfinancial businesses outside the housing sector though relatively
pessimistic has not changed substantially since our october meeting  in my conversations with
financial market contacts to varying degrees i heard the persistent and growing apprehension
concerning the spread of turmoil to an expanding set of affected markets and institutions and a
wondering of what will be the next shoe to drop  one consistent message is the belief that the
recent volatility and increase in term spreads cannot be entirely explained by the yearend problem
most of my contacts agreed that yearend balance sheet concerns are adding to market stress but no
one expressed confidence that getting past yearend will bring much reduction of concerns over
counterparty weakness asset values and secondary market liquidity  most expect financial market
turmoil to be protracted with increasing risk to the general economy  almost all my contacts noted
that deteriorating housing values are a root cause feeding problems in the markets  this view holds
that the adjustment in prices and inventory required to stabilize the housing sector will take many
months to play out and until that occurs the value of structured financial instruments and the
solvency and liquidity of structured investment vehicles will be uncertain  there remains a great
deal of skepticism that arrangements like the super siv and the treasurys rate freeze plan will have
much tangible effect  the issue of siv restructuring and support by sponsors is a growing focus of
concern because of their linkage to money market funds as well as their contribution to a general
contraction of credit availability  in sum my contacts in the financial industry uniformly express
the belief that things will not get better any time soon and may well get worse  while recognizing
that a rate reduction does not directly address the information problems in the markets there is
widespread sentiment that lower costs of funds will help
turning to the anecdotal inputs from contacts in my district there is some divergence of
views between contacts directly affected by the housing sector including bankers and others  bank
loan activity remains particularly weak in real estate segments  trucking large retailers auto
dealerships and businesses supplying building materials and household durables were identified as
segments where loan volumes are slipping  industrial warehouse markets have weakened in some
metro areas as subcontractors have exited  bankers also expect that consumer credit exposures in
credit cards auto loans prime mortgages and helocs will see a combination of credit
deterioration and demand contraction in 2008  the anecdotal messages from other contacts are less
dire  we took great care in our informationgathering this round to probe hiring expectations
investment plans and credit availability conditions  though credit conditions do seem to have
tightened we still are not hearing that they are preventing planned spending  spending and hiring
plans remain on the weak side but no more so than was the case at our october meeting
consistent with the greenbook projection for exports we heard that spending from abroad
including international tourism and condopurchase activity continues relatively strong  at the
branch board meeting in miami i heard that russians are the latest foreign buyers of condos  so
combine that with president pooles comment on trucks as a child of the cold war i think it is very
ironic that our bailout is coming from the russians  laughter  on the employment front the
demand for workers in sectors such as hospitality and energy remains quite strong but overall plans
appear to be more cautious  the trend in regional labor data mirrors the slowing trend in the
national statistics
each fomc round my staff provides a summary sentiment index of expected economic
conditions over the next six months based on responses of directors and contacts  relative to the
october meeting that index is little changed with the majority expecting flat or slower growth
when i combine the somewhat but not dramatically worse data inputs since the last meeting with
the anecdotal and survey information from regional and other markets im left with a view that
economic fundamentals current and prospective have not yet fallen off a cliff  that being said
theres not much of a case to be made for any risk assessment other than one weighted to the
downside  in my view the potential for protracted and growing financial market troubles should
weigh heavily in the policy decision and though recent core inflation readings are acceptable i
continue to be concerned about the ongoing divergence between headline and core inflation  until
they converge price pressures cannot be removed from the watch list  but overall i see more
uncertainty and therefore more downside risk in the real economic growth picture  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  there has been little change in the economic
conditions in our district since the october meeting  except for housing activity manufacturing
and other businesses are expanding at a modest pace somewhat below trend  our business contacts
are a little less optimistic about growth in the near term than they were earlier in the fall primarily
because of uncertainty surrounding the outlook rather than any immediate change in their business
activity  ill begin by reporting on what our contacts say about credit conditions  business contacts
as well as our board of directors have told me that credit activity has changed very little
creditworthy borrowers as far as they were concerned have had no problem accessing credit
banks have reported some tightening of lending standards but mostly that has occurred for real
estate developers and in residential mortgages  some loan demand has dropped because of
businesses uncertainty about the future as i suggested earlier  that is businesses seem to be a bit
more cautious  but banks do not appear to be conserving capital  in fact theyre actively seeking
good credits  to quote one of my directors the crunch on wall street has not hit main street  a
couple of bankers i spoke to one representing a very large regional bank and another a very large
community bank expressed the view that they were actively seeking to regain market share from
the larger banks because they did not engage in the same offbalancesheet financing of riskier debt
that the large banks did and so they were not facing either capital or funding constraints  some
bankers acknowledge that consumer credit quality seems to have deteriorated slightly but they
reminded me that this was from very good levels  so the defaults and delinquencies remain well
within historical norms
turning to the economy payroll employment continues to expand at a somewhat slow pace
in our three states yet the unemployment rate is still 04 percentage point below that of the nation
retail sales picked up in november  moreover retailers generally said they met their expectations
for the thanksgiving weekend  however these sales seem to have been boosted by fairly heavy
discounting according to them and despite the reasonable showing to date retailers are wary and
uncertain for the holiday season  housing construction and sales continue to decline but the pace of
that decline is in line with the expectations at the time of our last meeting  nonresidential real estate
markets remain firm in our district  office vacancy rates continue to decline and commercial rents
are rising  new contracts for commercial real estate have declined however but with the decline in
vacancy rates and with rising rents the outlook of many developers is not as negative as the current
level of spending would suggest  according to our business outlook survey manufacturing
activity in the district has been increasing at a modest pace for the past few months  the index of
general activity moved up slightly to 82 in november from 68 in october  this is actually about
the same average level that the outlook survey has maintained over the past two years  shipments
and new orders moved up slightly  however optimism regarding the outlook over the next six
months declined  its a common theme of many of our business contacts that their businesses have
not changed much but they seem to be reacting to the steady stream of negative news and it is
affecting their outlook  indeed the ceos of several very large industrial firms in our district report
business to be very strong both domestically and overseas and the ceos have seen little effect of
the turmoil on wall street on their ability to obtain credit
now last time i said that there had been little change in the districts inflation picture
however we have started to see evidence of increased price pressures  the business outlook
surveys pricespaid index has risen considerably since the beginning of the year and has doubled
since august  the index for prices received has also more than doubled since august rising
sharply in both october and november  also retailers have noted spreading price increases for
imported goods and a wide range of industries are reporting increases in energy and transportation
costs  firms continue to report higher health care costs and at the same time wages continue to be
moderate they say
in summary economic conditions have changed little since our last meeting  the business
activity in the region is advancing at a moderate pace  credit constraints experienced by the large
money center banks have not appreciably affected the banks in our district or their lending
practices  in general firms in the district remain cautiously optimistic about their businesses six
months from now but not so much as they were last month  price pressures have increased on the
input side related to energy and commodity costs more generally many firms are now prepared to
raise their own prices and are looking to do so in the near future and the financial conditions of our
banks remain good
turning to the nation financial market conditions especially those associated with the big
money center banks have clearly deteriorated in recent weeks  until the end of october spreads
were gradually declining  it seems that the potential for a serious meltdown was monotonically
declining  however since early november as we all pointed to a number of financial institutions
subprime mortgages jumbo mortgages assetbacked commercial paper belowinvestmentgrade
bonds and libor have experienced increased spreads  volatility has risen as well  clearly risk
premiums have risen for certain classes of assets and investors have fresh concerns about the way
credit market conditions are evolving  overall the recent financial developments suggest that it will
take longer before conditions are back to normal in all segments of the market  as ive said
before i continue to believe that price discovery still plagues many of these markets  it now looks
as though it will take a little longer before these markets can sort things out and return to normal
financial institutions continue to write off some of the investments and take losses  i view these
writedowns as a necessary and healthy part of the process toward stabilization  infusions of capital
in some financial institutions i think are encouraging and helpful to the process  this does not
mean that the ultimate agreedupon market prices for some of these assets will bear any
resemblance to what they did before august  indeed they probably wont  but thats not
necessarily a bad sign nor is it a cause for concern  in general it may be a very healthy
development
the news on economic activity has softened somewhat since our last meeting  among the
negatives of course the housing market and residential investment continue to decline
foreclosures have continued to grow at unprecedented rates  firms have become a little more
cautious in their investment plans  consumer spending has softened slightly and real disposable
personal income declined in october  oil prices have moved higher  on the brighter side so far
there is some evidence of spillovers from the financial and housing markets to the broader economy
but i believe it is limited  net exports and business fixed investment have been surprises on the
upside  finally and most important the labor market still looks pretty solid  foreclosures and
consumer weaknesses appear to be heavily concentrated in those states where the housing boom and
thus the housing price declines have been most pronouncedespecially california nevada and
floridaand in those states such as ohio and michigan that are feeling the effects of the decline in
automobile manufacturing  as president poole indicated credit card delinquencies were up but
highly concentrated in california nevada and florida  thus based on such observations and the
news that i hear from my district i sense that the stresses in the economy vary significantly by
region and we must be mindful that the weaknesses on wall street are in those states that have
exaggerated housing volatility and may not be representative of the rest of the economy  to be
sure we must be wary of continued deterioration and spillovers but at this point my assessment is
that they remain concentrated in a few regions and are not as widespread as some of the aggregate
data might suggest
its important to note that for a good part of the forecast for the fourthquarter gdp its
payback for strong inventories and net export numbers in the third quarter  i note that absent
payback and despite the worsening news economic growth would be on the order of 2 percent
higher  to put this differently the news since the last meeting has not altered the overall gdp
forecast for the second half of 2007  its about the same  the news has clearly altered the
greenbooks forecast for 2008 especially for the first half of the year but also extending into the
second half of 2008  the forecast calls for explicit spillovers from financial markets and the
housing sector to the broader economy to consumption to fixed investment and so forth  i should
note however that most private sector forecasters are significantly less pessimistic than the
greenbook  the blue chip survey our justreleased livingston survey our survey of professional
forecasters and several of the major forecasting firms that have issued forecasts in the last couple
of weeks see weakness extending into the first and maybe the second quarter of 2008 but a much
more rapid bounceback in the second half of 2008 than is suggested in the greenbook  these
private sector forecasts are more in line with my own view
while the news on growth is somewhat on the downside the news on inflation is on the
upside  readings on core inflation have been stable over the last few months but headline inflation
rates have risen sharply with increases in energy and commodity prices  the broader scope of
these commodity price increases and their breadth suggest that perhaps there are moregeneralized
inflationary pressures out there rather than these isolated relative price shocks  i will note that the
core pce inflation rate for march to june was 1 percent and in every threemonth window
subsequently the inflation rate has risen monotonically now reaching 226 percent for the latest
threemonth period from august to october  this comes after fairly steady declines in core rates
during the first half of the year  in my comments on the third district i noted the greater prospects
for price increases indicated by our manufacturing firms  i also am going to cite another statistic
from the same survey that president evans referred toduke universitys cfo magazine survey
the survey to which he referred was a survey conducted in late november and early december of
more than 600 cfos  in the survey the average price increase that these cfos were estimating for
their own products in the coming year was 28 percent and that was up from just 2 percent in the
previous quarter  thus it appears that firms are beginning to be more interested in increasing prices
and are more able to do so than they were just a few months ago even though the same cfos were
more pessimistic about the economy than they were in the last quarter
another piece of news on inflation expectations comes from the livingston survey which
was just released yesterday  there the forecast of the average annual change for the cpi for 2007 to
2008 moved up from 23 percent to 3 percent  this of course partially reflects the behavior of oil
prices during the past several months  the decembertodecember forecast on the other hand also
rose but only slightly
thus overall the economy is weak but only slightly more so than i anticipated  volatility
in the financial markets continues and the repricing of risk has not progressed as smoothly as i
would like to see  nevertheless the spillovers from the financial turmoil seem geographically
concentrated and broader spillovers appear limited to date  i view inflation expectations as fragile
and see evidence that price pressures are growing and that more and more firms feel that price
increases are coming and are supportable  i think we will have to be very careful not to presume
that just because price expectations and prices have remained contained that they will continue to be
so independent of our actions  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  ill start on the local level  overall our district
economy continues to perform generally well with ongoing weakness in the housing sector being
offset by strength in agriculture energy and manufacturing  we have seen some slowing in
employment growth over the past few months but this appears in part to be a supply consideration
our directors and business contacts continue to report that the labor markets are in fact tight across
much of the district with shortages of both skilled and unskilled labor and rising wage pressures
there is some reduction in employment obviously in the housing sector but that is being offset by
these other considerations  i would also note that manufacturing activity remains basically solid
with manufacturers reporting strong export orders  the districts manufacturing index moved
upward in november and still points to moderate growth  in addition district manufacturers
capital spending plans actually rose but remained below most of last years readings on balance
turning to spending general retailers reported a rebound in sales in the latter part of
october and early november  automobile dealers on the other hand did report weaker sales and
have also become more pessimistic on future sales  travel and tourism continues to expand in our
region with district airline traffic figures solid particularly in the denver area  likewise hotel
occupancy figures have continued to increase from already strong levels in the region  as has been
true for some time housing activity as i said remains soft  for example the value of residential
contracts dropped again in october and the rate of decline in residential permits steepened again in
the past few months in our region  offsetting this weakness in housing though is considerable
strength in agriculture and energy  district energy producers continue to expand their capital
investments as they are relatively confident that oil and gas prices will remain firm over the longer
term  in fact their capital expenditures have been slowed by a continuing shortage of labor and
access to some equipment  our larger regional banks are still reporting fairly good conditions  the
deal flows seem to be coming through although they are looking at those carefully just given the
environment that they find themselves in on a national level  finally price pressures remain mixed
most businesses report rising input costs both labor and materials but differ in their ability to pass
those costs on at this point  in transportation input costs are passed through one for one through
customer surcharges  other businesses continue to find it a little more difficult to pass through the
higher costs but they are beginning to push harder on that as we talk to them
let me turn to the national outlook  weakness in incoming data and continuing stress in
financial markets obviously are noteworthy and others have noted that here today  compared with
the greenbook however i see stronger growth in both the short run and the longer run  i expect
fourthquarter growth to be closer to 1 percent not the zero percent in the greenbook and the
economy to strengthen slowly through a good part of 2008 starting out slowly obviously and then
picking up as we go through the year  comparing my views with those in greenbook the basic
difference appears to be largely in some of the judgmental adjustments in the greenbook concerning
spillovers from the housing and financial stress to consumer spending  the current greenbook
forecast as others have noted is similar to the blue chip bottom ten forecast which suggests to
me that it might be better seen as the downside risk outlook not necessarily the most likely outlook
at this point  the first half of 2008 as i said is likely to be somewhat slower than i previously
projected because of the high energy prices and continued drag from housing  however i expect
that growth will gradually strengthen as we move toward the end of 2008 and then remain there
through the rest of the forecast period  having said this i realize that the downside risk to economic
activity does remain elevated  the housing slowdown could be deeper and last longer and
continuing financial turmoil could further affect consumer and business spending  however while
financial factors remain a risk to the outlook in my view the economy though it will grow below its
potential can weather these forces and is being supported by the policy actions that we have taken
in the past two meetings
against this outlook for economic growth let me turn now to the inflation outlook  year
overyear overall and core inflation rates have risen  in addition greenbooks 2008 forecast for
overall and core pce inflation has increased since our last meeting  while belowtrend growth in
the near term may exert some downward pressure on inflation the combination of higher prices for
oil commodities and some services and dollar depreciation should place upward pressure on both
overall and core inflation going forward  over the past several years the passthrough of dollar
depreciation and higher oil prices to inflation has been limited in part because of longerterm
inflation expectations remaining as we said anchored  my concern is that if we continue to lower
the fed funds rate into a rising inflation environment and the dollar continues to depreciate these
expectations may become unhinged perhaps more quickly than we would like to think  in this
environment i think we should not lose sight of not just the downside risk to the real economy but
also some very serious upside risk to inflation  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman having listened to various views starting with president
yellen on the one end and president plosser on the other and president hoenig on inflation i was
thinking that edward r murrow said that anybody who isnt confused really doesnt understand the
situation  laughter  im confused and i dont understand the situation  i would like to report
what i see however  first in terms of my districtin sharp contrast to the twelfth district
because i think they are two extremes or say florida in president lockharts district
employment growth has slowed  i mention this because last time i mentioned a data point which is
that within our districtactually in one stateyear to date we may have created up to onefifth of
the jobs in this country  we were growing our employment base at 39 percent in the first quarter
we expected it to slow to 31 in the third quarter and then to slow down to the high 2s as we
approached the end of the year  housing prices in our district are appreciating and were
benefiting from what we call the california diasporathat is particularly the techies and others
who are pushing up prices in dallas and austin  finally one point to bear in mind is wage pressure
oil and gas extraction represents only 2 percent of the employment of texas despite how
everybody stereotypes our state  yet the wage index in that industry and the labor shortage are
putting enormous pressure on skilled labor in other areas and the overall wage index for our district
is rising at the highest rate since january  unemployment is down to 41 percent for our district
so like president plosser we are enjoying a relatively strong situation
however my views on policy are not governed by the outlier district that i inhabit and id
like just to give some anecdotal evidence for what it is worth since most of the information i was
going to impart has been given by other thoughtful people at this table  first of all on the growth
side my conversations with the ceo of mastercard were quite detailed this month because i was
following up on what i was hearing from retailers at different price points  he said that retail sales
through november were up 6 percent year over year taking out gasoline 4 percent  he reported
that most banks are expressing some concern about receivables growth in california florida
nevada and arizona  but elsewhere and at the largest issuers as he put it he does not see
consumers running up their lines  i think this is in keeping with chart 4 the middle panel in the
bluebook which shows consumer credit fairly steady as you go through time and not significantly
increasing  second the ceo of walmart usasince you didnt mention walmartfeels a shift
in view in that consumers as he said with a terrible pun have driven through 300 gasthat is
they accept 300 gas  the ceo of jcpenney who reported before our last meeting that he felt that
the wheels were coming off the economy has sales 10 percent year over year to date through last
monday  as to black friday yes there was discounting on black friday  for jcpenney their total
volume was up almost 30 percent over their previous record year and there is a sense in the retail
industry that there may be a calming down between the two periodsthe prolonged shopping
period that you mentioned  nonetheless most of the retailers i speak to at different price points on
the gross side are happier than they expected to be  another phenomenon that seems to be
occurring is an increase in confidence with regard to inventory management  that was best
expressed by the ceo of texas instruments who reported that when we last met and actually
during the summer there was almost a freeze in terms of the willingness to build inventory and that
their customers were not willing to think beyond thirty days  now having looked through the
clouds that are presented on the financial front which ill address very briefly in a second they see
more willingness for ninetyday commitments
on almost every other front with the exception of the homebuilders i havent heard from
my ceo contacts the negativism that again is reflected on the wall street side of the equation
with three exceptions  in terms of the airline industry southwest airlines overall volume is down
36 percent in the third quarter  its pretty uniform across all districts including my own  we
talked about trucks earlier  one of my contacts is the largest truck dealer in the country  he
estimates according to what he calls if youll forgive the expression swagwhich is
sophisticated wildassed guess  i ask for the transcript to put the third letter in the third word as
in a snake rather than the posterior  laughter  but the estimate of class a truck sales whether
theyre going to russia or not was 350000 in 07  the original forecast for 08 was 280000 and
they now estimate 200000  so there is a significant slackening on that front
finally with regard to the housing market you obviously dont want to talk to anybody in
the homebuilding industry currently  but those with the strong balance sheets are taking advantage
of weaknesses in certain areas and ill give you one data point that was startling  in the
sacramento california area one of the large house builders just bought a fully developed set of
lots that were priced at 175000 a lot and the going price was 35000 a lot  significant deflation
clearly is occurring in that sectorbut also significant opportunity
id like to address the inflation situation more thoroughly mr chairman  the ceo of
walmart usa said that for the first time in his career at that firm they have approved a plan in
which purchase costs will increase 3 percent in 08  he hadnt seen that before in his experience
and said im totally used to deflation  deflation is finished  in terms of the suppliers to
walmart this was verified  i think on food prices we have to be extremely careful  fritolay is
seeking a 5 percent price increase for next year  walmart has acquiesced  according to the cfo
of that company thats the highest rate in fifteen years  kimberlyclark and other paper producers
as i reported before pushed through price increases  procter  gamble and others have followed
in terms of the energy situationwhether it is as i mentioned before exxon or the large
independentsthey dont see much price relief other than what is the variable factor presented by
the socalled city refiners
our own data at the dallas federal reserve indicate on the international side that there has
been some slackening as indicated in the bluebook but our work with jpmorgan and the index
were developing indicate that capacity remains very tight and that the tight capacity has added to
fuel and food prices and may well explain why inflation in the euro zone the united kingdom
japan and other areas including canada is higher than the benign trends theyve been experiencing
or are targeting in countries like mexico  so on net mr chairman from our perspective i cant
say i much agree with the greenbook because i have different views about business investment
im hearing reports of significant capex expansionand on the inflation front i believe that we
are understating inflationary pressures
now very quickly on the comment that was made about conditions in financial markets
having worsened  we hear this repeatedly  president plosser mentioned price discovery  i think
we have to be very very careful to not overreact to what we see developing on wall street and to
realize that there are benefits to price discovery  it is because of that price discovery that were
seeing a substitution effect which i referenced in my questions earlier  it may be equity for debt
but it is restoring balance sheets and reasonable prices obtain  i would argue that it is a healthier
condition than as i said earlier living in the fantasy world where we were pricing things at
ridiculous levels rather than realistic levels
well come to the policy discussion shortly but i would like to ask when we have that
discussion what we are really buying with a fed funds rate cutgiven the other mechanism that
were going to be putting forward and very very important remembering as president hoenig
president plosser and others have mentioned that we still have significant price pressures baked
into the cake  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  its 1030  it would be a good time to take a
coffee break  why dont we return at 1050
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we recommence  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you  the outlook for real activity has deteriorated
somewhat since our last meeting  in our modal forecast we now expect several quarters of growth
below potential with real gdp for 08 a bit above 2 percent  the sources of the deterioration in the
outlook for us are pretty much as outlined in the greenbook  what separates us from the
greenbook still is about 40 or 50 basis points of different views on what potential growth is  our
view of the likely path of the output gap is similar  so as in the greenbook we expect a deeper
contraction in housing activity and prices  we expect nominal and real income growth to slow
more than we expected and consumer spending also to moderate more than we had anticipated  part
of that lower path of real spending is of course due to energy prices  we also expect the rate of
growth in business fixed investment to slow a bit more than we had previously thought and these
changes are in part but not solely due to the expected effects of tighter financial conditions  for a
given path of the nominal fed funds rate they are tighter now than they otherwise would have been
because of the fall in the estimated neutral rate  in our view growth in the rest of the world will
slow a bit but along with the effects of the decline in the dollar it will still provide enough pull for
net exports to contribute positively to growth offsetting part of but just part of the deceleration in
domestic demand growth  our forecast for core inflation is little changed  we expect the core pce
deflator to rise at a rate just under 2 percent over the forecast period
like many of you we see considerable downside risks to the forecast for growth and they
have intensified since our last meeting  the greenbook alternative scenarios on housing and the
credit crunch seem plausible perhaps more likely to happen together than to happen independently
and i think reality is likely to fall somewhere between the baseline greenbook scenario and these
two darker alternatives  the risk to the inflation forecast still seems closer to balance in the forecast
period  the higher forward curve of energy prices and the lower path of the dollar will raise
headline inflation a bit and in the near term the core inflation path  but these pressures should be
offset by the fall in anticipated pressure on resource utilization not just here but also globally where
the economies that have been growing above potential are likely to slow as monetary policy
tightens
i think its important to recognize that breakevens in inflation at longer horizons have stayed
relatively stable in the context of the fairly substantial move in the dollar the fairly substantial move
in actual and expected energy and commodity prices and the very dramatic change in expectations
of how the fed is likely to respond to the change in the balance of risks to growth  in light of these
changes to the outlook and the risks to the outlook weve lowered our expected path for the fed
funds rate  we now think its likely that the committee will reduce the target rate to 375 percent
over the next few quarters and this puts our real and our nominal fed funds rate assumption for 08
a bit under the new path in the greenbook  wed raise it back in 09  but our fed funds rate path is
significantly above the markets estimate  as youve all recognized conditions in markets have
deteriorated substantially since our last meeting but the basic dynamic is still the same  actual and
anticipated losses to financial institutions have risen as the prices of a large range of assets have
fallen  uncertainty over the path of housing prices in the real economy and complexity in valuing
assets and structured financial instruments that are most exposed to those risks make it very hard for
markets to know with confidence the likely dimension of total losses and who is most exposed to
them
financial institutions have seen a sharp increase in their cost of funds a substantial
shortening in maturities at which they borrow and a significant reduction in their ability to liquidate
or borrow against their assets  most banks have seen a very large and unanticipated expansion of
their balance sheets as theyve been forced or have chosen to provide funding in various forms  as
banks and other financial institutions have moved to position themselves to deal with a more
adverse economic and financial environment they have become much more selective in how they
use their liquidity and capital  the consequence of those actions is evident in the sharp increase in
the cost of unsecured borrowing and the spreads on secured financing
now its important to recognize that although a source of this pressure is concern about
macroeconomic risk and its consequence for credit loss and asset values the consequences of the
adjustment by institutions to this new reality are very severe liquidity pressures in markets  these
are particularly acute in europe and they areat least in the markets expectationslikely to
persist well beyond yearend  these pressures are the symptom of the underlying problem as fever
is the sign of the immune systems response to an infection  but just as high fevers can cause organ
failure before the infection kills the body illiquidity itself can threaten market functioning and the
economy  the longer we live with these conditionslarge spikes in demand for liquid riskfree
assets a general shortening of funding maturities a limited amount of available financing even
against highquality collateral the risk of substantial liquidation of financial assets and the chances
of runs on individual institutions fundsthe more we are vulnerable to a selfreinforcing adverse
spiral that leads to a greater retrenchment in credit supply than fundamentals might otherwise
suggest and with a greater effect on growth
i dont think the past four to six months have been kind to those who have argued that this
was just a mild and transitory bump  as in august i think we have to be willing to treat both the
fever and the infection and if you step back a second the appropriate policy response to this set of
challenges will entail a mix of measures  monetary policy will probably have to be eased further to
contain the risk of a more substantial and prolonged contraction in demand growth  i think we will
probably need to continue to adjust our various liquidity instruments  we may need to encourage
some institutions to raise more equity sooner than they otherwise might choose to do  we need to
be very careful to avoid making both types of the classic errors in supervision in financial crises
these are on the one hand actions that would amplify the credit crunch by forcing banks to protect
their ratios by selling more assets  la new england or on the other hand the commission of what
you might call irresponsible forbearance  la japan in the hopes of masking weakness and stretching
out the pain  we also need to be careful to keep thinking through more adverse scenarios for the
economy and the financial system and the policy responses that may be appropriate if they
materialize
the united states is i think a remarkably resilient economy still  outside of housing we
dont have the same imbalance in inventories with the same degree of overinvestment in other parts
of the economy that we have had going into past downturns  corporate balance sheets still seem
relatively healthy  the world economy is no doubt stronger  current account imbalance is coming
down  our core institutions entered this adjustment period with a fair amount of capital  it is very
encouraging to see so many of them start to raise capital so early  the financial infrastructure is
more robust  inflation expectations imply a fair degree of confidence in our ability to keep inflation
low over time  the speed and the extent of the adjustment that weve seen in housing and by
financial institutions to this new reality are really signs of health of how well our system works
but we need to be cognizant that the market is torn between two quite plausible scenarios  in one
we just grow below potential for a given period of time as credit conditions adjust to this new
equilibrium in the other we have a deep and protracted recession driven as much by financial
headwinds as by other fundamentals  there are good arguments for the former the more benign
scenario but we need to set policy in a way that reduces the probability of the latter the more
adverse scenario  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  the outlook for economic activity has weakened
over the intermeeting period  the housing bust looks steeper with importantly greater declines in
prices and that will affect future consumption  weakness in housing and the uncovering of greater
losses at key financial intermediaries have contributed to a notable deterioration in financial markets
and a tightening of some financial conditions  we are also beginning to see signs that economic
weakness has not been confined to the housingrelated sectors  with regard to activity outside of
housing like many others who have spoken today i see the most notable development as the
flatteningout of consumption spending in september and october  that could reflect the rise in
energy prices but it seems to me that the very deep dip in consumer sentiment suggests that more is
at workthat the actual and expected effects of financial market turmoil for example on the cost
and availability of credit to households along with lower house and stock prices might also be
contributing to lessebullient consumption spending in the recent past and going forward
capital spending also seems to be slowing  although business investment spending hasnt
been revised down in the fourth quarter in the greenbook logically slower consumption growth will
show through before long as it does beginning in the first quarter in the greenbook  in addition we
have some more evidence of greater business caution which could damp business investment
relative to expected activity  the nfib survey for november for example shows that the outlook
by small businesses deteriorated decidedly in november  theres a sharp downturn in almost all the
outlook indexes for small businesses in this november survey and as i listen to the reports from
around the table i think for all except a swath of states from nebraska through texas maybe the
lower midwest im hearing a little more pessimism from other places around the country consistent
with this  to be sure employment continues to expand  various purchasing manager surveys also
suggest that activity continues to increase albeit slowly  but i agree with the staff that on balance
the incoming data suggest more nearterm weakness than anticipated at our last meeting including
some tentative evidence of spillovers from housing
financial market conditions have deteriorated substantially and that will place further
restraint on growth next year  i think what we learned in the first few weeks of november was that
losses are much larger than had been previously anticipated  those losses stretched into what had
been seen as higher quality mortgagerelated assets as bill dudley showed us and the losses are
large enough to call into question the ability of some very essential intermediaries to provide
support for markets or to extend much additional credit  those intermediaries include fannie and
freddie and the financial guarantors as well as some investment and commercial banks
as concerns about downgrades and potential fire sales rose investors and institutions moved
to protect themselves with the rise in term funding spreads symptomatic of the greater level of
concern  it is logical and reasonable that the response of intermediaries to this concern would be to
tighten terms and conditions for their loans to exert greater control over their balance sheets
expectations that intermediaries will be tightening credit along with the incoming spending data
led to a more pessimistic view of the economic outlook and although treasury rates fell
substantially concern about the performance of borrowers meant that those declines did not show
through very much into the cost of funds to private lenders and borrowers  indeed a number of
indicators point to a net tightening of credit conditions across a range of borrowing sources over the
intermeeting period and that tightening will persist past the new year  that tightening will have
adverse implications for demand by households and businesses in 2008that is i do think theres
going to be some spillover from wall street to main street  forward measures of the liborois
spread for after the yearend moved substantially higher  in effect the cost to banks of funding will
not reflect the full extent of the easing weve done in the federal funds market  the spreads on
corporate bonds have widened sufficiently to actually increase borrowing costs for both investment
grade and junkbond issuers over the intermeeting period  the leveragedloan market deteriorated
in late november forcing banks to take more loans onto their balance sheets using up scarce
balance sheet room  secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages remain moribund with no
signs of life and any loans that will be made in these nonconforming sectors will be placed onto the
balance sheets of thrifts and banks many of which are already facing strains  perhaps as a
consequence rates on prime jumbo mortgages have actually risen over the intermeeting period
fannie and freddie have increased fees and are tightening standards and they face slightly higher
spreads  so the damping effect of lower treasury rates on the cost of conforming housing credit
will be held down
all that said i do see some encouraging signs that the preconditions for future
improvements are coming into place  as others have noted specifically institutions are recognizing
and dealing more directly with the implications of these losses  they are recognizing the losses
more aggressively  theyre raising capital and theyre being more explicit about taking contingent
liabilities like sivs onto their balance sheets  even so i think that what we have learned over the
intermeeting period is that the process of returning financial markets to more normal functioning is
going to take longer and the disruption to the cost and availability of credit will be greater than i had
thought just six weeks ago
prospects for a period of weaker economic growth and reduced resource utilization do work
to lower inflation risks  in addition weve seen a downward revision to compensation and unit
labor costs and commodity prices outside food and energy have fallen substantially in recent
weeks  at the same time energy prices have risen and past inflation data have been revised higher
and the staff has actually revised up its inflation forecast by a tenth or two over the next few years
so on balance i judge the inflation risk still to be to the upside if the economy follows the modal
forecast but by considerably less than i thought at the last meeting  i look forward to a discussion in
the next part of the meeting about how we deal with the policy implications of this changing
situation
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  like many of you i think that the risks of bad
economic outcomes are higher than they were when we met in october both here in the united
states and among our trading partners  the profound deterioration in financial marketswhich in
my view has changed significantly more so than the data on the real economyas been much
discussed already  ill make two separate observations about that deterioration now versus on the
darkest days in august or september  first were seeing a very meaningful preference for
treasuries as opposed to agencies  in our discussions and in the data several months ago they
would have tended to be bundled together but are putting more pressure on treasuries in this
current environment  second it strikes me that more overnight funding is being done by more large
financial institutions and that has to concern us as we talk in the next round about policy  liquidity
conditions have been hurt by several related factors most of which speak to a lack of confidence
certainly there are lower expectations about the macroeconomic environment and a lack of
confidence in counterparties and in funding through yearend but perhaps mostly the escalating
risk aversion within the four walls of most but not all very large financial institutions has caused
this market turmoil both in the formal banking system and in what president yellen described as
the shadow banking system
so why have these institutions lost faith and so much conviction  ill give a few reasons
first senior management instability  second a lack of confidenceby boards senior managers
who are still around and the rest of their peoplein the riskmanagement systems  there is a
growing chasm of confidence between the boardsand those who are around themabout their
stress tests and about their ability to withstand a series of shocks that could lead to further
deterioration  there is also a very bad riskreward tradeoff for those who are prepared or have been
given some ability to put balance sheet capital to work  if they make a bet and it turns out to be very
bad in this environment their jobs and the jobs of many of their peers will be over  if they make a
bet and it turns out to be as good as they expect they wont be keeping much of the fruits of that
trade  as a result i think we are finding that key people across institutionswhich president fisher
and others talked about as keen to provide opportunistic capitalhave stepped back i would say
materially  finally its not yearend pressures with respect to balance sheets that strike me as
having the biggest effect here  its that as these managers are looking at their businesses for 2008
theyre fundamentally having to ask themselves the questions about what businesses they are really
inwhether they all should be originators distributors and holders of credit and risk or whether
they need to go back to where they were five or six years ago when they were picking their
comparative advantages  as they look at the budgets for next year i think they have a lot of
understanding of what their cost structures are if they dont change their personnel but they have
very little clarity about what their topline revenue will be  that has led to some serious questions
about putting capital to work when youre really not sure what your core businesses are  i expect
that process not to be completed in weeks or months but really in quarters and its for that reason
among othersas governor kohn referencedthat i expect this period of relative strain to last for
a while
let me raise a question that i asked at the last fomc meeting  are we seeing merely a
change in the competitive landscape or a fundamental weakening across classes of financial
institutions  i would say that today most large financial institutions both money center commercial
banks and large investment banks are on the sidelines to some meaningful extentunable or
unwilling to put their balance sheets with any real force to work on new capital or on new projects
theyre likely to be stuck there for a while  surely there are a few large institutions with both
capital and conviction that are opportunistically deploying capital with extremely compelling equity
risk premiums  i think about that more as cherrypicking than any interest or ability of these
institutions to buy the entire orchard  so they will be survivors but they are being very very
careful
is there enough opportunistic credit from those institutions that distinguish themselves
along with classes of other institutions that we talked about todaylarge foreign banks us
branches superregional banks midsized banks community banks credit units the gses the
home loan banksto pick up market share and take advantage of that slack thats been left for a
period  i think in a word the answer is no  that is they will inevitably pick up some market
share during this period  this is good news for the institutions that had been crowded out by the
money center banks invading some of these regions  but as i look at their own conviction at their
own balance sheets and importantly at where their source of credit might come fromfrom these
same capital markets that are in dysfunctioni get encouraged that they can pick up some of the
slack but i wouldnt expect them to be able to pick up enough for us to avoid the spillover effect to
the real economy  it is true that many of these institutions now find business and new loans to be on
better terms  theyre price leaders rather than price takers  there is less competition for some of
these new ci loans and some of these new consumer loans  this is a good thing but again i
wouldnt overemphasize that they are somehow going to be able to pick up the slack
what about other forms of opportunistic capital like sovereign wealth funds and hedge
funds that are playing an important role in reliquefying large banks  again i see that as part of a
solution but in my view were really still early in that process and most of those institutions that
are out looking for capital are likely to get more rounds of capital in the coming weeks months and
quarters  the terms of the investment by some of these external funds suggest that this is not the
final fund raising but really one of the first  in some ways this is a much trickier position than if we
saw one class of financial institutions that was weaker and thought that others could fill in  again
the provision of credit normally made possible in this environment by the structured finance
markets is affecting all financial intermediariesthe weak the strong the regulated the
unregulated those on wall street and those in other cities
so what does the immediate future hold  let me spend a moment breaking down a few
classes of these institutions  investment banks first  i expect most of them to be on the sidelines for
a while  i expect the 2008 budgets which are still coming together now to likely suggest that they
are exiting from some businesses and firing employees in larger numbers than markets expect right
now  what about large money center commercial banks particularly those that have been in the
headlines  obviously i would expect them with some leadership clarity to take a direction but
these businesses take a very long time to turn  so what will they do  they will continue to prune
their balance sheets continue to sell noncore assets and businesses continue raising capital and
continue their discussions with rating agencies about meeting rating agencies expectations  these
rating agencies want to be observers  they no longer want to be market makers or market
participants but i suspect theyre going to find a reversion to the role of some years ago hard to pull
off in this environment  what about superregionals and community banks which many of you
spoke about with some view that their current balance sheets look okay  i think there is a sense of
foreboding in that group about their commercial real estate exposures  even though they are largely
open for business we shouldnt overstate their ability to pick up some slack  after all the
secondary market is closed for many of them  their portfolio lending is up  the credit line
utilizations are being fully tapped  their own profit projections are likely to be coming down over
2008 and even though they certainly want to increase market share theyre reading the same
headlines and my own judgment is theyre likely to be still somewhat worried
in sum these problems appear to me to have been long in the makinglong before they
struck the housing marketsand will be somewhat longer in the rebound than we might have
thought even some weeks ago  the catalysts for improvement though are manifold  first new
leaders with dispassionate views are coming to many of these financial institutions and are willing
to sell assets at prices that the leaders who brought them into different businesses might have been
unwilling to do  again it strikes me that the ability to sell an entire book of business at a fixed
dollar amount and run a competitive auction might help clear many of these prices that have
otherwise looked pretty stubborn and pretty hard to mark  in terms of other validators that might be
coming into these new investments as i mentioned i think the raising of equity funds is
encouraging but these validators particularly those in the united states and some in sovereign
wealth funds elsewhere are pretty patient and i dont see any of them thinking that they need to
deploy their capital quickly or on terms with which they are uncomfortable because they will have
an opportunity to look at tens and dozens more term sheets in the next several quarters  as many of
them are making investments now they have a range of term sheets in front of them and that
judgment wont be rushed in their view  so the idea that it would be a panacea for the real economy
strikes me as a bit overstated in the current environment
so what about the real economy  no doubt the turmoil in financial markets some of which
was selfinflicted has the potential to do more harm to the broader economy in the fourth quarter
and in early next year  but we have to be humble about our understanding of that transmission
mechanism  the preceding discussion strikes me as giving less comfort than i had at the last
fomc meeting on the shortterm resilience and dynamism of our financial markets to repair
themselves quickly  im still very optimistic over the forecast period and the medium term but it
puts more of a burden on the resilience and dynamism of our labor markets and more of a focus on
the resilience and dynamism of our product markets and of our businesses  they do appear to be
holding up okay  in my view if you look at the various surveys that were referenced earlier today
and the business roundtable survey of ceos these would be much more dire forecasts if we were
in recession now than they appear to be at this moment  most of these ceos who are not great at
calling inflection points still think that their business is okay  the economy has slowed it is
riskier but it strikes me that we have a good shot of being able to follow through on the pattern
outlined in the greenbook
finally just let me make a quick note about inflation risks  i think the inflation risks have
garnered certainly less of my attention in this intermeeting period and might have garnered even
somewhat less of the discussion around this table  the inflation risks that we saw six weeks ago
strike me as not having improved very much  inflation risks are quite real and so as we are
choosing our policy options we have to keep these in mind  but we obviously have to take the
shorterterm risks and the illiquidity in the markets into account first and foremost as we think about
both monetary policy and liquidity policy  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  at the last meeting i expected a somewhat rougher patch
particularly in housing than the last greenbook scenarioa sort of slowburn scenario or
something that dave made reference to  but over just the past three weeks or so the heat of that fire
has become a lot greater than i had expected in terms of the burn that im seeing in the financial
markets as well as in the real markets particularly with respect to consumption as many people
have mentioned and then more broadly just the reclosing of markets that had opened up  i
described some of the markets and the turmoil saying that things were in sort of a brittle
circumstance  unfortunately i think in certain parts were starting to see some cracks show
i want to focus on thinking about banks balance sheets and how that addresses some of the
issues that weve talked about  for commercial and industrial lending as many people said there
still seems to be reasonable robustness in the investmentgrade corporate sector  those guys
havent yet seen a lot of pressures in terms of increased cost of fundingnot a reduced cost of
funding but also not an increased cost of fundingjust a slight increase in terms but its no
problem for them to deal with those kinds of terms  they have the markets open to them both for
longterm debt issuance and for intermediateterm debt issuance  they have bank funding that is
available  most of the banks the large banks as well as smaller banks are suggesting that although
they may be tightening standards somewhat there is still a reasonable amount of credit demand and
that most boards and executives are saying continue to make those loans  firms balance sheets
are still quite strong  firms have built up a lot of cash or liquid assets on their balance sheets over
the past few years of profitability so that part hasnt seen that much of a challenge  some of the
increases that weve seen and measured on the books of banks in terms of their ci portfolios are
the taking on board of some leveraged loans on which they had made commitments a number of
months ago those commitments are now being drawn down and so theyre increasing their
portfolios  so some of the increase in ci lending is really just commitments that have come in
earlier  the leveragedlending market which had opened up for syndication has quite affirmatively
closed once again  thats clearly a negative development
with respect to sivs assetbacked commercial paper conduits it seems that many of the
banks are going it alone without waiting for the mlec  virtually all major banks have announced
programs for bringing assetbacked commercial paper or sivs onto their balance sheets  so this is
still orderly but its beginning to show some stress on the balance sheets with the leveraged lending
and all of the sivs coming on board and this underscores the importance that a number of people
mentioned about capitalraising efforts and ensuring that capital will be available not just above the
regulatory minimums but enough to make the market certifiers the rating agencies and others
continue to feel comfortable
a number of people have also mentioned that the flattening and in some cases the
downturn in commercial real estate and the tightening of terms are of particular concern at the
midsized and smaller banks  as you know we had issued some guidelines a little more than a year
ago on commercial real estate concentration and concerns about that because we had looked back to
what happened during the savings and loan crisis and saw that we were starting to get banks into the
same levels of concentration that we had seen back then that were associated with troubles
although we had a lot of negative pushback at that time i think that was not an unreasonable thing
to do but there are still a lot of challenges at those institutions
consumer lending is probably the area in which ive seen the greatest change and it has
raised my concerns the most  ill hold off on mortgages for a moment  first i talked with a very
large provider of credit cards and other consumer products helocs mortgages et cetera who
said that since the report that i received just before the last fomc meeting when things were
reasonably stable they had seen significant deterioration  as some people have said even though it
has gone up sharply the numbers are still reasonable but its the delta that concerns me the very
sharp deterioration that theyre seeing  theyre seeing this nationwide  the sharpest deterioration
is as a number of people have said in the areas that have seen the greatest housingprice stress
california nevada and floridabut its not limited to those  i wont go through all the details of
what they told me on delinquency rates on different types of products but nationwide they are
seeing doubling tripling or quadrupling in those areas and this is over a period of just six to eight
weeks  so thats really quite significant and concerns me in combination with some of the lower
numbers that were seeing with respect to consumption
also one of the phrases that they use is that theyre now seeing contagion in their book
so its not just in one particular area but through a series of consumer products and its not just for
subprime borrowers  they noted that onethird of the chargeoffs had a credit score of over 700 at
the origination of the mortgage  so its far beyond just the subprime area  obviously as a number
of people have said the mortgage markets have really not reopened  there had been some hope
around the last meeting that the jumbo market would reopen  were seeing no evidence of that
the subprime market is not really open  the abx indexes and other indexes are suggesting that
markets are anticipating extremely high loss rates even beyond what bill was suggesting with the
15 percent loss  now i dont know whether those are reflecting just loss rates or whether other
issues with respect to a lack of liquidity in the markets or hedging that is going on but still its a
concern  as i mentioned last time the caseshiller sp index although extremely thinly traded
when you go out a year or two is still suggesting potentially a 20 percent decline on average in the
ten cities that they look at  so nothing has improved there and given the tightness in the markets
given that we know that there will be more resets coming given the continuing pressures theres
probably going to be a lot more downside potential for housing prices and that of course could
again feed into lower consumer spending  so thats the concern on the real side
the concern on the financial side is that obviously all these things put a lot of pressure on
bank balance sheets  gathering capital is very important but basically what were seeing is a very
very slow revival of the markets and i agree with many of the others who have said that its going
to take a while  a lot more information model building and hiring of people who can analyze
these things will be needed  something that was disheartening to me is that the mortgage bankers
association said that they hope by early next year to be able to provide sufficient information to the
market so that people can really assess on a loanbyloan basis whats in their cdos and thats a
real concern  the information is simply not out there  so its not just confidence or concerns
people are now looking carefully and saying i just dont have the information to be able to make
an assessment  thats of course on top of the macroeconomic risk and uncertainty about housing
prices in general  so i do think its going to take a while for these markets to revive  as the vice
chairmanactually both vice chairmenand others mentioned if you look into the forward
markets for the ois spread and other things this is going to persist  this is not just an endofthe
year problem
people are looking to the banks for reintermediation and for taking a lot of things on the
balance sheets  thats going to continue to put a lot of pressure on the capital that they have and i
think there will be continuing uncertainty for both us institutions and international institutions that
things have to keep coming on their books and they wont be able to get other things off their books
so that is a real challenge going forward
just a moment on inflation  i certainly am heartened as many other people have said that
as expectations about our policy moves have changed we havent seen a significant uptick in
inflation expectations although by some survey measures we have seen some upticks  but real
inflationary pressures are out there and each incremental step we take with respect to policy easing
potentially has higher and higher costs with respect to inflation  there are no free lunches here but
we do have to be mindful of the downside risk particularly with respect to the banking and the
financial system  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  you are all aware that i have a very optimistic
personality and at the last fomc meeting i actually had that kind of optimism  i felt that the
economy was evolving in a quite reasonable way and in fact was responding to our policy changes
in a way that i felt was very appropriate in order to minimize the cost of the financial destruction
that were experiencing  in particular with the credit markets stabilized we were in a situation in
which our policy moves had reduced a lot of the macroeconomic risk that was out there in terms of
credit spreads  clearly we were still left with the opaqueness spreads or valuation risks that would
require price discovery to resolve  it looked as though that was going to progress very slowly and
over time wed get out of the situation we were in and the economy would go through a solid
rebalancing moving away from some sectors that had too much going onthat is housingto
sectors which we needed to expandfor example the tradable sectorto deal with some of the
global imbalances that we had  so i was actually feeling very positive  i felt that things were going
exactly the way that i had hoped
of course things dont always work out that way and we started to see shortly after the
october meeting a substantial deterioration in credit markets  my view is that the deterioration that
were seeing is appropriately reflected in the substantial revision to the forecast  im very
comfortable with the way the staff has revised the forecast downward  its obviously something
that is an art because you have to do it in terms of add factors but you do want to inform it by
science and i think they have appropriately done so in terms of thinking about what weve learned
from past experiences that may tell us about how credit disruptions of this type will actually lead to
lower spending in many categories
but i want to talk about why my sunny disposition is much less sunny right now and why
im actually very very worriednot to say depressed but at least a little more that way than usual
it is because i think that the kind of negative scenarios that are pointed out in the greenbook are
very real possibilities  in particular there are two scenarios that they go into separatelythe
housing correction scenario and the credit crunch scenario  i think that theres a very strong
possibility those would come together because if housing prices go down more that creates a much
more serious problem in terms of valuation risk and a serious problem in valuation risk will mean a
further credit market disruption which then can lead to more macroeconomic risk because it leads
to this downward spiral  the real economy gets worse  that means that there is more uncertainty
credit spreads get worse and you get a very bad scenario happening  that could lead to the credit
crunch scenario  similarly a credit crunch scenario i think would have a very negative effect on
the real economy which would mean that housing prices would go down which would then make it
much more likely that we have the greater housing correction scenario  so thats the first part of my
depression
the second issue is that the greenbook does not go into the issue of what effect that might
have overseas  there has been a lot of discussion in the media about decoupling the us economy
from foreign economies and when its just trade thats going on i think that is usually completely
reasonable  but when its financial then there is very good reason to think of recoupling because a
financial disruption in the united states is very likely to spread to financial disruption abroad  we
of course have already seen that  its remarkable that what happened in the subprime sector has in
some sectors affected european banks maybe even more than american banks  so the possibility
that problems develop in the united states and lead to problems in europe and other advanced
countries and then those problems actually spill over back into the united states again means that
theres a third scenario that could be all tied together
when you look at all of this i get very nervous  the bottom line is that my modal forecast
is certainly down very much along the lines of what the staff has suggested  but i think there is a
significant probability that things will go south  you dont like to use the r word but the
probability of recession is i think nearing 50 percent and that really worries me very much  i also
think that theres even a possibility that a recession could be reasonably severe though not a
disaster  luckily all of this has happened with an economy that was pretty strong and with banks
having good balance sheets otherwise it could really be a potential disaster  i dont see that but i
do see that there is substantial risk that the economy could have a severely negative hit to it that
would be very very problematic
now when i look at the issue of inflation i have a different view from many of the people
at this table  i feel strongly that the one thing a central bank can never afford to do is to lose its
nominal anchor  if we do that its a disaster  with that viewpoint i should say that if shocks
occurred such that recession was going to occur and the only way we could stop a recession from
occurring was to inflate the economy we couldnt allow that to happen  we actually have to
preserve the nominal anchor because in the long run the pursuit of price stability is what makes
good monetary policy and has been a key reason for the remarkable success of monetary policy by
the central bankers throughout the world in recent years that i think nobody would have predicted
but when i look at whats going on in terms of inflation right now i really do not see the substantial
upside risk that a lot of people are talking about  for me the key driver of inflation is as you know
inflation expectations  the question is whether inflation expectations are grounded and i think the
answer is yes  in fact weve had a situation in which higher energy prices have not led to any
upward movement in expected inflation as far as i can tell  neither has the dollar declinedthat
actually happened when the economy was doing much better
now were facing a situation in which we have some substantial negative shocks to the
economy and those substantial negative shocks actually if anything put some downside risk in
terms of inflation  i dont see that inflation will move much from 2 percent  one thing that has
happened recently is that we have not seen some of the favorable inflation numbers  president
plosser talked about the fact that weve seen less favorable inflation numbers but thats because we
had temporary factors that were going to make inflation look overly good and drive it below 2
percent  the staff strongly indicated to us in the greenbook and in past greenbooks that those
temporary factors were not going to persist  they got that one right but theres no information
from the fact that those temporary factors are no longer present that says that inflation pressures
have actually heated up  indeed what we see is that inflation seems to be moving around 2 percent
thats where i think inflation expectations are grounded and i see no tendency at all for things to
get much worse in that regard  im not saying that couldnt change and so i think we have to be
very vigilant  but in the current environment where i see a very negative potential path of the
economy the idea that inflation is our primary concern right now is not where i am  with that let
me end
chairman bernanke  thank you governor  well again thank you for a very
helpful discussion  let me just try to briefly summarize and then offer a few additional comments
many participants obviously gave considerable attention to the resurgence of stresses in financial
markets including the increased losses by financial institutions widening spreads and poorly
functioning markets  some expressed concern that these developments were likely to result in
tighter creditnot just in mortgages where conditions are already tight but in other areas as well
perhaps resulting in spillovers to the broader economy  a weakening economy could cause
financial conditions to worsen further leading to a negative feedback loop and indeed there are
signs of some broader credit deterioration  impending mortgage rate resets and foreclosures pose
further risks  some took these developments as increasing downside risk to growth perhaps
significantly  however other participants noted some mitigating factors including the fact that
banks came into the situation with a lot of capital  some institutions have raised capital  theres
the possibility that other credit providers could take over from money center banks  corporate
balance sheets are strong  the credit problems have a regional focus in some cases and there is a
lack of effect so far on many on main street  some also noted that the price discovery process was
inevitable and needed
with respect to the macroeconomic data overall the incoming data were slightly weaker
than expected particularly in housing and consumption although again the anecdotes were
somewhat mixed  fundamentals for consumption are weaker but not collapsing with the labor
market and perhaps wealth still providing some support and mixed information on retail sales
differences across regions and products were noted  with the possible exception of commercial
real estate in some cases investment is not yet much affected by credit conditions  improvements
in inventory management were cited as a positive  unemployment remains low and wage
pressures exist in some areas but they were less cited i think its fair to say than in past meetings
export demand related to the weaker dollar and strong foreign growth provides some help to the
manufacturing sector although it was noted that other countries might not be immune to a
slowdown in us growth  overall most participants saw slower growth but there is greater
agreement that the outlook is in any case more uncertain
on inflation some took a relatively benign view noting the restraint from a slowing
economy and less tightness in labor markets  others noted some recent increases in core inflation
and continuing pressures from energy food and the dollar  many stressed that stable inflation
expectations cannot be taken as a given  any comments or questions
let me just add a bit to the discussion because as usual it has already been very thorough
again if one looks at the incoming macro data i think a fair judgment is that it was a little weaker
than we expected  the economy has been a little slower than we expected  housing data
consumption and i would argue investment and production numbers were all somewhat lower than
we thought was going to be the case at the end of october  i would also argue that in particular the
consumer who of course is crucial to the expansion is facing somewhat weaker conditions
including higher oil prices less wealth from lower stock and house prices and perhaps tighter
creditthan was the case a month and a half ago  i think it is noteworthy that the unexplained
portion of consumer sentiment has declined considerably  there seem to be attitudes or if you like
forecasts among consumers that are even weaker than would be suggested by some of the
conditions they are currently seeing and i think that is a concern
now there have certainly been positive developments in the data  the labor market has
held up pretty well  the unemployment rate actually dropped a bit last week  stocks have come
back a bit from their socalled correction although i should say that this is conditional on a lot of
expected easing by the federal reserve  ism surveys show manufacturing as flat but
manufacturing is still growing and there was a bit of good news yesterday in housing with some
slight indications of improved pending sales  i think its interesting that the michigan survey notes
that prospective homebuyers are actually a bit upbeat because they see interest rates as low and
prices as more favorable  so again the data suggest some weakness but the story is not entirely
unmixed
so how would we interpret this  i think you could take a more sanguine view that we are
seeing the continuation of a zigzag pattern that weve seen for quite a while  we had very weak
growth in the first quarter of this year for example but even with the zero growth projected for the
fourth quarter we will see 22 percent growth in the first half of 07 and 25 percent growth in the
second half of 07  so it could be that were just seeing a zigzag pattern and some of that is
certainly true  its also still true that a lot of the weakness were seeing is in the housing sector  for
example for all of 07 growth excluding housing is about 3 percentso again not suggestive of
great weakness  now all of that being noted i dont think id go quite as far as governor mishkin
i try to maintain an even keel here in my mood  laughter
mr kroszner  i believe david and his fellows can provide you with some pills
laughter
chairman bernanke  but i think im in the camp of those who see a fundamental
softening going on here  one indicator is the pattern of final demand  this zigzag pattern has been
mostly in a situation with basically about 2 percent growth in final demand but with quarterto
quarter variation in exports and inventories  we see in this case the opposite  growth in private
domestic final demand is projected by the greenbook to fall to minus 02 percent in the fourth
quarter and another minus 03 percent in the first quarter of next year  it does seem to have been a
stepdown in economic growth outside of housing
the other issue is the financial markets which so many people have commented on  i just
note that there are several elements to this  first are the losses and the downgrades that have hit
capital  these have been only partially offset by new capital issuances  in particular weve seen
about 75 billion in writedowns or losses in the financial sector of which 45 billion has occurred
since our last meeting at a time when we thought things were clearing up  criticized loans by our
supervisors for the top fifty bank holding companies rose from 26 to 28 percent over the last quarter
so were seeing continued losses and i expect to see that to go forward  the second element of this
is the pressure on balance sheets  banks are taking offbalancesheet assets onto the balance sheet
an example that governor kroszner mentioned is the leveragedloan market which was open for a
while and now seems to be closed and securitization markets remain closed
moreover and i think this is particularly worrisome going forward supervisorsand you
all of course talk to your supervisorsare increasingly concerned about credit quality as it looks
likely to evolve  commercial real estate is one area in which weve seen essentially no defaults yet
but these things tend to lag and theres a lot of expectation both among bankers and among
supervisors of that sector weakening  one indicator of banks views is that they have been raising
their loanloss provisions at a rapid rate 17 billion in the third quarter  it was at a twentyyear
high and we are certainly hearing from for example the federal advisory council that they expect
credit quality to continue to deteriorate  the result of this is that although i do not expect
insolvency or near insolvency among major financial institutions they are certainly going to
become much more cautious and i think that will affect their lending behavior and their willingness
to extend new credit  as has been pointed out some of the natural substitutes like the socalled
shadow banking system are not really there at this point and i would also be less sanguine than
some about regional and community banks which face their own problems  lack of securitization
outlets and a lot of exposure to commercial real estate
so i do think that were going to see some tightening of credit and that it could get worse
experience suggests that while financial conditions are always different and the financial structure
has changed significantly credit crunches can have a big effect on the economy  the case thats
been cited the most is the 199192 crunch when the capital losses were pretty limited regionally
but nevertheless there was a national impact  another smaller perhaps less relevant example is
the carter credit controls in march 1980 which were very small in their aspiration yet somehow
managed to create a short recession  so i believe that the financial conditions are going to be a
significant drag  it is going to go on for a while  given the low growth expectations it could lead
us into a negative growth area  i see realistically only one way in which we could avoid a drag from
the financial system which would be if in fact we get lucky and the housing market begins to
stabilize and theres a sense that weve reached bottom there and house prices are stabilizing  i
think that would do a tremendous amount of good for the financial system  it might lead to
sufficient improvement as to avoid some of these consequences
you know i do think that we have to take note of the fact that the twoyear government
yield is down about 75 basis points in real terms since our last meeting and that fiveyear bond
yields are down about 60 basis points in real terms  thats certainly a market view on whats
happening to growth expectations and its not terribly inconsistent with some of the figures that
come out of the greenbook calculations  so obviously there are mixed views but i think it is very
hard to argue that both the modal growth forecast and the rest of that output forecast have not
shifted adversely
with respect to inflationagain people made these points as wellit is unfortunate that we
do have some instability some risks there  we saw some stabilization of the dollar over the past six
weeks  that is obviously not exogenous  it depends on our behavior and our communication  i
think oil prices depend also to some extent on our policy directly or indirectly  we will be seeing
some ugly nearterm inflation numbers with oil price increases which we hope will move out of the
data shortly but were not sure  so obviously we have to watch that  i think there are a few things
that are slightly helpful on that front  one is that relative to the previous intermeeting period
theres more conviction now that other countries may be easing monetary policy  in fact weve
seen cuts in canada and the united kingdom  i think that takes a bit of the risk away from the
dollar
i do not know how big the impact of the national intelligence estimate about iran will be but
it certainly reduces a bit the geopolitical risk that has been around oil over the past couple of years
but of course i agree with governor mishkin and many others that whatever we might be tempted
to do in terms of trying to get ahead of the financial conditions and what i fully believe will be
ultimately a main street problem as well as a wall street problem we need to be highly
cognizantthis is not a ritual but an honest statementof those implications for inflation
expectations and the dollar as well  so let me stop there just adding that i think the situation is very
difficult and we need to recognize the uncertainty that were facing  i believe that in response we
will have to make sure that we are sufficiently flexible open minded willing to accept new
evidence and new information and willing to respond actively and quickly when we do get that new
information  let me stop there and let me now ask for volunteersoh sorrybefore we do that
brian will introduce the policy goround
mr madigan2  thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the draft announcement language in table 1 which is unchanged from the version distributed in the bluebook and which is included in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  as shown in section 4 of the lefthand column following the october meeting the committee issued a statement that concluded that the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth suggesting that the committee saw reasonably good odds that after 75 basis points of easing the stance of policy would foster sustainable economic growth and price stability over time  as many of you have noted however events over the intermeeting period have undermined this view  the staff and the markets have interpreted incoming information as pointing to a distinctly weaker outlook for the economy  as dave discussed the staff has lowered its forecast for aggregate demand in light of deteriorating conditions in financial markets incoming data on spending and output that were weaker than expected and the higher path for energy prices suggested by futures markets  that weaker forecast for aggregate demand was reflected in a 70 basis point decline in the greenbookconsistent measure of the equilibrium real federal funds rate which placed it about 40 basis points below the current real federal funds rate  these developments have prompted the staff to tilt down its assumed trajectory for monetary policy with a 25 basis point easing at this meeting and another  point move in 2009  the assumed easing is not quite fast enough to offset the adverse shock to aggregate demand and a small degree of economic slack consequently emerges over the next year or so that was not present in the october greenbook  that slack can be seen as purposeful as the staff has also interpreted incoming information as implying a modest adverse shock to aggregate supply  recent inflation data and higher energy prices point to higher total and core inflation in the third and fourth quarters and in the staff forecast over the next few quarters as well  given the restraint on inflation resulting from the projected emergence of modest slack the staff judges that its assumed path for monetary policy will leave total inflation and core inflation respectively at the same 17 percent and
19 percent annual rates in 2009 that were projected in the october greenbook

should the committee find the staff forecast persuasive as a modal forecast view that outcome as satisfactory and see the risks around that projection while perhaps larger than previously as not sharply skewed in either direction it might be inclined to ease policy by the quarter point assumed in the staff forecast and adopt a statement along the lines shown as alternative b in table 1  like the staff members might see the incoming evidence as suggesting that the outlook for real activity has weakened and perhaps that the downside risks to growth have increased  the deterioration in financial markets in particular might be a source not only of a downward revision to your outlook but also of a greater sense of uncertainty about prospects for aggregate demand  the financial system is dealing with significant

credit losses and resulting capital erosion and constrictions on balance sheet capacity the eventual effect of those problems on the availability of credit to households and firms is unknown  in particular the potential interactions of financial stress with real economic developments especially those in the housing sector are difficult to assess in view of these considerations as shown in section 2 the suggested rationale language for alternative b would state that economic growth is slowing would cite softening in recent spending data and would indicate that financial strains have increased in recent weeks  while the committee may see significant downside risks to spending it might also remain worried about the potential for an increase in inflation pressures and might view inflation risks as having risen a bit over the past six weeks  the recent inflation picture looks slightly less benign than it did earlier
moreover the increase in oil futures prices suggests that energy prices could continue to boost overall and core inflation  members may also view downward pressure on the dollar as likely to persist  the language shown in section 3 would continue to cite the same concerns about inflation that the committee has recognized in recent statements
in circumstances of increased risks to growth and continued substantial inflation risks the committee might as back in september prefer not to express an overall assessment of the balance of risks  as shown in section 4 the committee could say that recent developments including the deterioration in financial market conditions have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation  however if the committees predilection is that further easing will probably be necessary but it still wishes to underscore its concern about inflation you could insert a sentence after the first sentence in section 4 saying that on balance the committee sees downside risks to growth as having increased but it must also remain attentive to the upside pressures on inflation  most dealers expect you to couple a
 point easing today with an assessment that the risks are skewed to the downside but even the version without an explicit risk assessment probably would be read as consistent with further policy easing going forward particularly since you eased in october following a statement in september that was comparable to the one shown in section 4  it might be worth noting that many market participants expect the federal reserve to augment its monetary policy action today with some announcement regarding the discount windowfor example a reduction in the primary credit spread  as the chairman noted earlier today the absence of such a reference in todays announcement could prompt some investor disappointment but given your monetary policy action under alternative b the effect on market interest rates seems likely to be limited and presumably any effect today will be reversed tomorrow
if the committee is already persuaded that the economic outlook has weakened more sharply than in the greenbook or if it has become significantly more concerned about the downside risks to growth it might prefer the 50 basis point easing of alternative a  the committee might see the larger move at this time as warranted particularly by riskmanagement considerations  the greenbook presented two alternative scenariosa greater housing correction and a credit crunchthat illustrate downside risks and suggest that the committee may need to ease markedly
further over coming quarters  in the case of the credit crunch scenario for example the estimated version of the taylor rule calls for a funds rate that troughs at
26 percent well below the low point currently built into market interest rates  as shown in the second column the language suggested for alternative a explicitly cites both a weaker outlook and greater downside risks in explaining the relatively large policy move  as in alternative b the language on inflation would be nearly unchanged from that employed in october  but in section 4 of alternative a the committee would indicate a judgment thatfollowing the further reduction in interest ratesthe upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth  or the risk language shown in red in section 4 of alternative b could instead be employed under alternative a this might be appropriate if the committee felt that the same elevated risks that motivated it to ease 50 basis points also suggested that it was difficult to weigh the remaining risks after the action  in either case short and intermediateterm market interest rates would likely decline noticeably under alternative a  in contemplating the pros and cons of alternative a one consideration might be whether the committee views this combination of sharp easing and the associated language particularly the version coupled with an inconclusive risk assessment as likely to lead market participants to worry about what information the committee might have that would lead it to take such a substantial step and so undermine investor confidence
if in contrast the committee saw the downside risks to growth as somewhat greater but was not yet convinced that the outlook had deteriorated substantially and remained concerned about inflation prospects it might consider implementation of alternative c  as indicated in the righthand column under this alternative the committee would maintain the stance of policy at this meeting but conclude that the downside risks to growth now are the predominant concern  with overall inflation on the high side and upward pressures stemming from energy prices and dollar depreciation members might be concerned that policy easing could go too far  the stance of policy has already been eased 75 basis points despite only limited evidence to date that economic weakness is spreading to a significant degree beyond the housing sector  indeed as some of you suggested the incoming indicators of slowing growth over the intermeeting period may be broadly in line with what you expected in october  if so the committee may feel that its monetary policy actions to dateand at the margin the establishment of the taf as well as swap lines with foreign central banksprobably will provide sufficient insurance that financial problems will remain contained and will not greatly restrict the availability of credit to households and businesses  thus members may believe that further easing is not and probably will not be necessary  indeed members may find worrisome the prescription of the optimal control simulation in the bluebook that a slight degree of policy firming would be appropriate over coming quarters if the committee were pursuing a
1 percent longrun objective for inflation  even with such unease about inflation prospects though the committee may be sufficiently concerned about the current threat to growth to judge that on balance the risks are tilted to the downside with an unchanged stance of policy
i will conclude by responding belatedly to a question that president evans posed at the last meeting  he asked what the experience has been with including an indication of downside risks in the policy statement  in particular would markets likely see such a risk assessment as signaling a likelihood of an imminent policy easing  answering the question on the basis of the historical record is not entirely straightforward partly because the committees practices have evolved over time as president evans noted it has been only since 1999 that the committee has released a risk assessment or some other form of a tilt along with its announcement  despite some qualifications the basic answer seems to be not surprisingly that the risk assessments have been predictive of future committee action  the experience from december 2000 through january 2002 makes this point clearly  during that period at fourteen meetings in a row the committee indicated that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future  in eleven of those fourteen instances that indication was followed by a policy easing at the next meeting  later toward the end of 2002 one of two indications of downside risk was followed by an easing and in june 2003 a different balance of risksone concerned with disinflationwas followed by an easing
all in all it seems reasonable to judge in current circumstances that maintaining the stance of policy while assessing that the risks are tilted to the downside as under alternative c would lead market participants to continue to put high odds on future policy easing  but the absence of policy action at this meeting despite nearly unanimous expectations of policy easing would mean that the expectation of a downtilt in rates would begin from a notably higher level and might be less steep prompting a significant upward shift in short and intermediateterm interest rates
that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  questions for brian  president evans
mr evans  brian thank you very much for that answer  i have a clarifying question
because im not quite sure i caught in the way you talked about the economic risks in section 4 of
alternative b how they could be added  one thing that i wanted to ask about is that in section 2
theres no mention of downside economic risks  at least the five or six times i read it i couldnt
find it  that seems different from alternative c and alternative a and also the october statement at
least in the balance of risk mentioned downside risks to growth  is there a particular message that
were thinking about sending with that  i guess part of the question is that without some mention
of expected slowing are we maybe undercutting our november forecast that we published  it
seems natural that there would be some discussion about how things have slowed relative to what
we were expecting  i mean that might be one way that those forecasts would be interpreted and
used  but i lay that out as a question
mr madigan  president evans in response to your first question the suggestion for
section 4 of alternative b would be to add after the recent developments sentence on
balance the committee sees downside risks to growth as having increased but it must also remain
attentive to the upside pressures on inflation  with regard to your other question i think that
characterizing whether the slowing in economic growth right now is what you anticipated may be a
little difficult  it is relatively early in terms of the information thats available for the fourth quarter
so it may be difficult to pin that down very precisely
chairman bernanke  any other questions  all right  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  weakness in economic data reported
since the last meeting continued financial turmoil and a forecast that places us uncomfortably close
to a recession calls for action and my strong preference is for the decisive action reflected in
alternative a  with wellanchored inflation expectations and the possibility of unemployment rising
above our estimate of the nairu the risks to inflation from this action seem quite low  however
the possibility that the economy will soon be in a recession is too high and our action should be
significant enough to substantially reduce that risk
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  with respect to policy i also favor
alternative a a 50 basis point rate cut  let me explain my reasoning  otherwise i certainly agree
with what president rosengren said  first i think the equilibrium real rate of interest is low relative
to its longrun average  the range of mediumrun measures of r reported in the bluebook is
between 18 and 23 percent and this range includes the greenbookconsistent measure and the
staffs kalman filter model estimate of 21 percent  market perceptions of future real interest rates
are also very low with yields on fiveyear treasury inflationindexed bonds now below 1 percent
i think the headwinds from financial market turmoil and the more general reassessment of risks that
is taking place in global markets are good reasons why the equilibrium real rate may be low in the
current situation  we do have historical precedence for this  for example kalman filter estimates
of r fell noticeably during the credit crunch of the early 1990s
given the current state of the economy with inflation near a level consistent with price
stability and resource utilization near its equilibrium level policy should be close to neutral which
implies a nominal funds rate of 4 to 4 percent  the forecast and risk assessment must also enter
the analysis  with an assumed 25 basis point cut at this meeting the greenbook foresees the
economy barely skirting a recession so any more bad news could put us over the edge and the
possibility of getting bad newsin particular a significant credit crunchseems far from remote
to my mind the risk to the forecast and the risk of a vicious cycle in which deteriorating financial
conditions and a weakening economy and house prices feed on each other argue for adopting a
riskmanagement strategy that at the very minimum moves our policy stance to the low end of
neutralnamely a cut of 50 basis pointsand i think it argues for doing so now rather than taking
a wait and see approach and lowering it only grudgingly  this may not be enough to avoid a
recessionwe may soon need outright accommodationbut it would at least help cushion the blow
and lessen the risk of a prolonged downturn  i should also say that my recommendation assumes
that the implementation of the taf even if it succeeds in improving liquidity in the money market
will not appreciably alleviate macroeconomic conditions
regardless of the policy actions taken at this meeting i think we need to be very careful in
these unsettled conditions about how we communicate our assessment of risks and likely future
policy actions  we should maintain maximum flexibility so that our future actions can in governor
kohns wellchosen words be nimble  if the committee chooses to cut the funds rate 50 points i
would favor the assessment of risks from section 4 alternative b in table 1  this appropriately
leaves open what the future policy will be and stresses that it depends on developments  if the
committee goes with the 25 basis point cut then i would support using the assessment of risks from
section 4 alternative c which states clearly that the predominant concern is the downside risk to
growth  otherwise i fear that market participants may mark up their expected path for policy over
the next year leading to further erosion in financial conditions  finally i would suggest that given
the long period of time between today and the next fomc meeting we be open to the possibility of
a special intermeeting videoconference to assess economic and financial developments and this
meeting could also benefit from an assessment of the effects of the taf once its in place
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i favor a  point reduction in the funds rate
and the language of alternative b  perhaps more than usual i think it is important to preserve
some flexibility now to respond to incoming information  i would not be surprised if we want to
reduce the funds rate another  point at the end of january but i dont want to send a signal that
would encourage market participants to presume another cut then  so i guess i am in the
grudgingly camp to which president yellen referred  besides i would welcome a permanent
move away from the balanceofriskassessment machinery  i do believe we face a goodsized
risk of things unraveling and substantially weaker growth in the near term  but my sense is that
the risk just isnt large enough to make me want to support 50 basis points now  while i
wouldnt be surprised with a january rate cut i dont think it should be a foregone conclusion  i
think we need to be more deliberate about such actions as we go forward  the magnitude of the
fallout from our mortgage problems could be substantially clearer in the first half of next year  if
the fallout turns out to be smaller and more manageable than we fear the downside risks to
growth prospects could dissipate even though we still would be working through a bulge of
mortgage resets and defaults
some of us have given a warning that we may need to reverse course promptly and raise
rates should conditions improve  you know it is always attractive to comfort ourselves as we
cut interest rates and to promise ourselves that we are willing to do so but there always seems to
be a reluctance to start a sequence of funds rate increases after a series of rate cuts  the usual
thing is a fear of sort of an exaggerated reaction in the yield curve  these pressures are likely to
be especially acute if when the time comes we are still in the midst of significant distress
among subprime mortgage borrowers and the housing market  that seems likely  so i think we
need to be realistic about prospects for reversing field  to the extent that such pressures would
be hard to resistand i think they would bewe should be very cautious more cautious than
we otherwise would be about lowering rates
another reason to be cautious is that overall inflation is well above our targets  as david
stockton pointed out we have a record of forecasts for food and energy prices based on futures
market prices coming in too optimistic over the past several years  i think we need to be
concerned about that  i am concerned that market participants might have come to believe that
we have placed our concerns about inflation entirely on hold for the duration of the housing
market difficulties we face  such a lexicographic reaction function is what led to the stopgo
policy pattern in the pre1979 era  so i believe it would be a mistake to take our eyes entirely off
inflation right now  i am doubtful that a forceful restatement of our assessment of upside
inflation risk will be very effective in that regard  we have been doing that and i think it is
falling on increasingly deaf ears  i think that we may come to believe that action is required to
back up that sentiment  if inflation drifts up or overall inflation doesnt come down i think we
need to be prepared to respond to real weakness less than we otherwise would have before
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i would say that when governor mishkin
talked about the importance of maintaining longanchored expectations about inflation i agreed
with that  i think that is more vulnerable than others do and so if it were on the table i would
support maintaining the rate  i think inflation risks are elevated  i am uneasy about lowering
rates into a rising inflation environment and i think we should have allowed more time for the
75 basis points to work  having said that however i also acknowledge that the downside risk to
growth may be larger than i judge it to be  there is a lot of evidence out there right now and i
have heard it from around the table  thus i can accept the 25 basis point cut if that is the
committees preferred action  i would be very uneasy with a 50 basis point cut at this time and
i do not think a 50 basis point cut is warranted in conjunction with tomorrows announcement of
a term auction facility  i think that would send a signal to financial markets that we view the
outlook as more dire than it is thus adding to financial turmoil rather than alleviating it  so i ask
the committee to keep that very carefully in mind as we go forward with this discussion  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president hoenig did you have a view on the statement
mr hoenig  i do  turning to the statement i think the language in alternative b is
the right language regardless of whicha b or cwe choose  i think in particular i would
prefer that we not assess a balance of risk and instead simply state that recent events have
increased the uncertainty on output and inflation  thank you
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b including the language
and let me outline how i get there  first i think that it is important to recognize that the
greenbook outlook already takes account as best we can or as best the staff can of a lot of the
dismal financial news that is out there  there is a probability distribution around that  we dont
want to doublecount the financial distress  it is already in the baseline forecast and we dont
want to think of all the weight of the financial distress effect as being down from there  so there
could be an outcome that is certainly stronger than the greenbook outcome  in fact i think it is
true historically if you look at forecast accuracy any forecaster including the greenbook staff
does not have a standard error all that much below a very nave outlook that just says that gdp
will grow at potential  so i believe that there is genuine weight above the greenbook forecast in
the probability distribution and i think the greenbook forecast is a very good baseline for our
discussion  second clearly should the unemployment rate rise significantly credit problems are
likely to multiply rapidly  we could have a great deal of distress that would accumulate
possibly very quickly  on the other side should the nonhousing sectors prove more resilient
than the greenbook forecast we could be faced by upside surprises especially on inflation
certainly i would come down hard on the side that following a policy that temporizes on
inflation only builds in a much deeper problem in the future and it is better to take the medicine
early if necessary to deal with inflation
i would also note that over next year there will be an increasingly high bar on any
change in the federal funds target  there is an election in november  i have tremendous
confidence in the nonpolitical outlook of every single member of the committee every single
participant indeed it is a very deep part of the culture of the institution  nevertheless there are
tricky issues involved with maintaining the appearance of impartiality and i think historically
during an election year there is a strong presumption to try to stay as low key as possible  the
way you do that is not change the fed funds rate target at all unless there is a really good case
and that is increasingly true as you come up to the november election  so as we go through the
year there is going to be an increasingly high bar it seems to me and if we overshoot on the
easing side it may be difficult to come back until 09  i think that every cut is likely to be
permanent through next year in any event  that tells me that we should pursue a strategyi say
we but it is more you because the next meeting is my last
mr mishkin  you will be sailing
mr poole  not quite after that meeting  it is still a little cold  laughter  but my
instinct is that we have demonstrated a willingness to act decisively when there is a very good
case in the data  so if data come in with very bad employment reports additional financial
distress and all of that i dont think there is any question that the market will then anticipate
decisive action  that wasnt so true back in august by the way but the fact that there was a
50 basis point move in september has conditioned the market to respond differently  i would be
in favor of a strategy that says at this point if we indeed go down another 25 basis points we
will have cut the target by 100a strategy that is very open but in a sense follows the market
now if it turns out that we have a lot of weak news in the weeks ahead the market is going to
build in further rate cuts  it will do a lot of the work for us without our having to be out front
you will get the benefits brought forward because the market is going to bid those in and
therefore i think a strategy that tries to follow the data to demonstrate a clear willingness to
respond to the incoming information gives us the best chance for stability over the coming year
despite the memo that i distributed which i think was an option that we should consider
i think that we should not have any balance of risks view because it is highly desirable to leave
everything very open  meeting by meeting we or you will have to decide whether the case is
being made from the data  of course i think that the speeches and other communication will be
very important to try to explain the strategy and the process by which we assess and respond to
the data maintaining always a longerterm view and not getting carried away with the most
recent observations  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i support the action and language of
alternative b  i think rates are too high right now to support the economys remaining near full
employment and higher than they need to be to contain inflation  when we left the meeting last
time we thought we might be where we needed to be but that was premised on a lack of
spillovers outside the housing sector and improving financial markets and both of those have
proven not to be the case  so i think we need to move  how much is a tough question  if we
were to do 25 we would still have restrictive policy based on the staff forecast because 25 basis
points moves the unemployment rate above full employment  so it is still on the restrictive side
even with 25 in the greenbook  of course we would be outrageously tight relative to the
markets expectations of what we need to do  so i think 25 basis points still leaves us a little on
the tight side and i suspect we will have to do more over time  but i am comfortable doing 25 at
this meeting
there is just a huge amount of uncertainty about how the financial markets are evolving
especially before the end of the year  i think we will have a little better sense of what the net
deterioration is when we get past the yearend into january and see what effect if any our
auction facility has  some of the signs we have had in the incoming data havent been that
negativethe employment reportwhich is a really key report and the fact that there is
continued growth in employment gives me a little reassurance that we are not in some huge
downdraft in the market and that we dont need to move that aggressively  we do have high
headline inflation that we are looking at and some inflation risk  so i think at this point that
25 basis points would send a signal that the federal reserve is awake and on the job and i would
stick with language that gives us maximum flexibility which i think alternative b section 4
does  president fisher asked what would a decline in the federal funds rate do  i think it
would do quite a bit  it doesnt address those losses directly i agree  but i think it would offset
some of the tightening in financial conditions or would move in that direction  it would help
asset prices  i also asked myself when you asked that question president fisher what would
happen if we didnt lower rates  i think we would have much tighter financial conditions in the
market adding to what is already a distressed situation  so i really think that the 25 will be
beneficial  a lot of people around the table have saidand president evans raised the question
about whether there are some downside risksthat somehow we could express something more
in the statement  i wouldnt object mr chairman if someone found some language to put a
little more sense of downside risks about the outlook somewhere in the alternative b statement
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i think we clearly should be reducing the
federal funds rate at this point  while i think it is a close call i guess i would come out with
doing a quarter at this meeting  basically i get there by just trying to weigh the risks  i think the
principal risk is the dysfunction in financial markets and what that could imply prospectively for
the performance of the economy  i think that is the basic case for taking action now  i think the
risks are asymmetric  i dont see the same risk to the near or intermediate term in terms of
inflation outlook  yes we may get some high headline numbers but we hope at least that those
will dissipate rather quickly  so that is where i come out
i would support the language under alternative b  just to add one thought on that  you
know last time we tried to characterize the balance of risk and i dont think it turned out to be
persuasive  we would do well to be very very cautious at this point  obviously there is a lot of
uncertainty out there and at this point discretion is the better part of valor
chairman bernanke  rules versus discretion  laughter  thank you  president
plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  in the last two meetings the committee cut
the funds rate 75 basis points  we did so because the outlook for the economy has clearly
deteriorated relative to our views in early august  we have argued that we have been acting
preemptively to help forestall and to mitigate potential fallout from the deteriorating housing
market and financial disruptions  how successful have those rate cuts been  i think it is too
early to tell  it is still true that the effects of monetary policy on the broader economy
especially on spending output and employmentoperate with a considerable lag  it is my
guess that our previous cuts or anything we do today will not have measurable effects on the
broader economy in terms of spending and output until late in the first quarter of next year and
more likely in the second and third quarters  so i dont think anything we do today will have an
appreciable effect if any on the economys firstquarter performance  thus ones view about
the future path of the economy during the second half of 08 depends critically on what you think
the effect of our decisions will be going forward  now contrary to what some may think i am
not immune to the drum beat of downbeat news that we have heard  i am keenly aware of the
concerns expressed around this table and by others who are more concerned and anticipate a
much more prolonged period of reduced growth  i have marked down my forecast for the first
half of 08 but my view of the second half has not changed very much  thus while i am okay
with the 25 basis point cut at this meeting i would like to highlight that there are risks to that
decision  i would oppose a 50 basis point cut
as suggested in my earlier remarks i do think that there are increasing underlying
inflation pressures and although we have not seen inflationary expectations change very much in
the data i do think they are fragile  before i stop i would just like to give one example of that
concern  in the last philadelphia fed survey of professional forecasters conducted in early
november we asked a special question  we asked panelists whether they believe that the
fomc has an inflation target  about half the survey respondents said that they believe the
fomc has an inflation target and of those close to 90 percent responded that they thought our
target was for core pce inflation  they also provided their views on what the target was  the
median estimate of that target was between 16 and 17 percent  among these forecasters almost
all those who thought that we had a target also indicated that their longtermthat is their ten
yearforecast of pce core inflation was systematically 50 basis points  percentage point
higher than what they thought our target must be  we asked the forecasters if their forecast was
different from the target why it was  almost all the forecasters presented a variation on a very
similar theme  many of them said well the fed really has goals other than inflation or they
wouldnt stick to it or they would find it painful and therefore not commit to the goal or
they lacked credibility  now this is a small subsample of people  nevertheless i find it
interesting that these professional forecasters are really not terribly sure about our commitment
to price stability  the issue is not what they thought the target was per se but what the
differential between their forecast and the target was
finally just regarding language i have been uncomfortable for some time with the
practice of summarizing the balance of risks and i share president lackers concern in that i
would like to get rid of it  so i would support alternative b with the language  i will also
reiterate the point that while we may be making ourselves feel better the fact is that we need to
be prepared to act quickly if things reverse themselves and we have to reverse the rate cuts  i
agree with that  on the other hand i think the history of this institution is such that it is in fact
more difficult to do than it is to say so i think we need to have some caution  so i favor
alternative b and the language as expressed  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  as i listened to the first goround
comments i charted everyone in a quadrant chart with high risk to growth and benign inflation
in the upper lefthand corner  then i had of course three other squares or quadrants and so far i
am seven for eight listening to the remarks  so maybe this predictive power has some influence
or some spillover into how i come out on this  i dont suppose 37 would fly  laughter  you
know on balance i find myself in the upper lefthand quadrant more concerned about downside
risk to the economy and viewing at least for the present inflation as a relatively benign
consideration  so given my sense of the downside risks and the uncertainty that is associated
with the financial markets my recommendation is 50 basis points at this meeting and my
preference is to remain as much as possible agnostic on the january action  i take note from the
advice i get from some of my own staff that taylor rule projections suggest that the medium
term nominal equilibrium rate is about 4 percent and 4 percent comes the closest to being the
likely neutral rate  it is relatively likely that incoming data will suggest that a cumulative cut of
at least 50 basis points is warranted by the end of january  so in my view moving to that rate
now is really the most prudential  in some respects that is the most conservative and risk
attentive policy  i continue to adhere to the riskmanagement perspective in dealing with our
challenges and continuing to take out insurance against extreme downside scenarios seems
correct to me  notwithstanding the view that the fed is and should be reluctant to take back a
rate cut i prefer facing up to that difficult decision possibly next spring to undershooting the
needs of the situation and potentially compounding the problems  so i dont see a lot to be
gained from an incremental approach of 25 basis point cuts  it has been argued with much
validity that overnight liquidity isnt really the problem and wont cure the information gaps that
beset the market  but i would argue that given the profoundly unsettled state of the financial
markets erring on the side of moreaggressive action provides some insurance against
continuing liquidity seizures  to the extent that psychology and confidence matterand i think
they matter a great deal in these circumstancesit is on its face a stronger message
regarding the statement i actually prefer alternative b  i think the finessing if you will
of the balance of risks and its mention of increased uncertainty come closest to my views  so i
suggest consideration of the thrust of alternative b possibly with the insertion that brian
mentioned connected to a 50 basis point policy action  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i dont think i could have said it better than governor
kohn said it  i am on his wavelength  i would just add a couple of things that i would suggest
we consider  first of all with regard to the financial situation which is obviously driving this
conversation i appreciate the medical pathology that the vice chairman suggested  we have
gone now from cardiology which is my thing to this fever and the fever breaking and so on  i
combine it with a bit of the strawman that governor warsh raised  no one has suggested a
panacea  no one has suggested that the existing pool of ersatz money outside money or shadow
money is fully sufficient to relieve the stress the system is under  what has changed however
since the august crisis is the process of price discovery  we are beginning to actually get
realistic pricing  i spent twentyone years buying distressed assets on wall street  i think i
understand the process  it is a patient process and it takes time  but i think that is the only
difference  we have begun the process it has a long way to go  we have enormous risks and i
fully agree with vice chairman geithner that there is significant risk that might stem from this
but lets not also understate the fact that some adjustment has begun and that is good news
i would suggest 25 basis points mr chairman because i think we have to be very wary
of shooting an entire bolt here  if we do 50 basis points plus the taf plus the swap linesthis
is all very subjectivemy opinion is that we would scare the hell out of the markets  there is a
significant risk if we send a signal as was previously saidi think brian may have said this
that we have information that other people do not have  president lockhart referred to delicate
psychology  from a riskmanagement standpoint i think the psychology is the opposite of what
he stated which is that we are at risk of interfering with the beginning of the adjustment process
that i just described  if people feel that we know more than they do that we have greater fear of
the downside you are going to see a delay in that adjustment  they are wanting to step up and
cherrypick a little before you start going through the whole orchard  so those would be the two
factors that i would suggest  i want to come back to the last point  our job is to keep inflation at
bay  the nominal anchor you mentioned is critical  i heard more people speak around this table
about being worried about inflation than did not so speak
and a secondtothelast point  i agree with president poole and the suggestion of i
think charlie plosser  i would like to be like the reserve bank of australia and raise the rates
despite the political election if we had to  but i think the scrutiny of this institution will be
intense and my preferred mode is just to stay out of the way  i think it is politically very brave
and possibly foolish to say that well if we do too much here we can always pull it back  there
will be a lot different circumstances next year and i worry that we may do too much  i would be
against 50 basis points  i would be in favor of 25 basis points and i would be in favor of
alternative b as stated if i had a vote  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i favor a  point reduction in the fed funds
rate today  as i noted earlier assuming some ease in policy my forecast is that the economy
will experience subpar growth stretching into the middle of 2008 but then recover as we move
into 2009 and that inflation will remain contained  our forecast assumes that the disruptions in
financial markets will generate morerestrictive credit conditions for consumers and businesses
than we have seen to date though not to the degree assumed in the greenbook baseline  in light
of my outlook i think that policy should be somewhat accommodative and given that i think the
longrun neutral nominal funds rate is somewhere around 4 to 4 percent i support further
easing  given our expectations of coming financial restraint there is a good chance that we will
ultimately want to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points but i prefer to go slower than that and
move down only 25 basis points today
the slowing in consumption that we have recently seen reflects only a couple of months
of data that followed quite strong growth during the summer and much of that softening may
reflect the transitory jump in gasoline prices  so i dont think it is clear that we have seen a real
change in the trajectory of consumption  i think the degree of financial spillover built into the
greenbook baseline is a plausible scenario but we have not seen such spillover yet  the
pessimistic view is a very forwardlooking one and i applaud forwardlooking thinking  i am
not quite there yet but that is definitely a risk  i hesitate to say that we will know more next
meeting because it is such an obvious thing to say but i definitely agree with governor kohn
that by the end of january we will at least have a better idea of how the taf funding went and
how much of the recent increase in liquidity demand and related disruptions are transitory end
ofyear problems as opposed to morefundamental problems that would impinge dramatically on
credit conditions for nonfinancial borrowers  we will also know more about the actual strength
of consumption and investment  another concern i have about a 50 basis point move today is
that the public might see it as an indication that we have read the incoming news more negatively
than i at least think we should have so i agree with presidents hoenig and fisher on that  this
would have negative implications for the already fragile state of consumer and market sentiment
but from here to a 4 percent fed funds rate i think that the inflation risks are acceptable  beyond
that i think it depends importantly on inflation developments and also developments in the
economy
in terms of the statement i prefer alternative b  i like the additional sentence that brian
was suggesting in section 4 for the balance of risks  but however that comes out in reading
section 2 when i was asking the question it just seemed to me natural that after incoming
information suggests that economic growth is slowing something like somewhat more than
previously expected might be helpful but nobody else has really mentioned that and i am okay
with that
finally on the political concerns my memory is that we raised the funds rate during the
2000 and 2004 elections so i am not really concerned about that although people will wonder
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i favor a 25 basis point cut in our fed
funds rate target and the language in alternative b  more losses at financial companies in
combination with uncertain yearend funding pressures obviously have unsettled financial
markets again  as i said earlier sentiment about business conditions next year have become
considerably more pessimistic in the past few weeks  in this environment leaning toward
caution and providing the added shortterm liquidity that markets appear to need makes sense to
me  although i can see the arguments for a 50 basis point adjustment in our policy rate i am
inclined to think that a lesser policy response is called for
as others have indicated it may be that a 25 basis point action is going to prove to be
insufficient and another cut might be necessary  but i am also mindful that efforts to address
the problems that are affecting the real economy have the potential to aggravate inflation
expectations  indeed by some cuts of the tips data and from a few reports that i am receiving
from business contacts about rising commodity prices and rising import prices inflation
expectations may be tugging on their anchor just a bit  given these considerable uncertainties i
think smaller moves are preferable to larger ones  at this time i simply cant assess with any
useful precision how to weigh the risks we face only that the risks we face are very difficult
consequently i favor the language expressed in alternative b as it is currently written  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b as is  without
monetary policy action it does strike me that the harm to the real economy could be larger and
longer than otherwise  similarly i would say that without employing the liquidity tools that we
discussed when we met by videoconference monetary policy may well be insufficient to bring
about real improvement over a reasonable period of time  so i like the combination as a very
useful natural experiment to help us figure out what the diagnosis of the patient really is  it does
concern me that if we go with 50 basis points today along with the taf the swap and other
actions it would be harder to disentangle what exactly ails these markets which is some
combination of capital and liquidity
with respect to the question of how muchagain back to the 25 or 50 basis point
moveit strikes me at least that this is a very hard time for us to be evaluating what the
equilibrium fed funds rate is  if policy is a function of both the fed funds rate target and what is
going on and how capital markets are reading and processing that information these markets are
in a period of incredible dysfunction  that suggests to me that we should go slower and be more
cautious in trying to get to equilibrium  it is easier to assess that when markets are functioning at
levels that are superior to where they are functioning now and i hope by the time we meet next
that the markets will be giving us a clearer read so we can approach equilibrium or at least
understand it better
finally with respect to some of the discussion around alternative b section 4 i think as
written it gives us maximum flexibility as was referenced earlier  i dont happen to think that
market expectations would be changed much if we added a sentence about downside risks to
growth  i think last time around they took our uncertainty paragraph learned that it meant that
there was a rate cut coming and i dont think we need to push farther than that at this point
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i think we have two fronts on which we have
to workboth the macro risks in particular the housing risks and the liquidity issues and their
interaction as a lot of people have discussed  so i favor a 25 basis point reduction with the other
actions that we will be taking with respect to liquiditythe taf and the swap  i think it is very
important at least in my thinking to see them as a package to try to work on both margins
because many people have raised concerns about the liquidity issues perhaps spilling over into
being real economy issuesso liquidity issues turning into capital issues that can turn into credit
constriction issues  with respect to the macro risks most people around the table have said that
those are real and that we need to work on those  then of course there is an interaction between
the two  part of the reason for the difficulty of reviving the price discovery process is
uncertainty about what is going to happen in some markets particularly housing markets  so
providing a little more insurance there is valuable  but there is also a concern that even
independent of that there could be liquidity problems that cause difficulties so working on these
two fronts is certainly very valuable  we will then have cut the federal funds rate 100 basis
points and will have taken some steps both with the reduction of the difference between the fed
funds rate and the discount rate and these new actions to try to provide more liquidity
with respect to the statement i think the statement as it is in alternative b is probably the
most effective  it is important for us to express the uncertainty with respect to the balance of
risks rather than try to describe the balance of risks  i dont really see what would be added by
talking about particular downside risks when we can simply say that there is uncertainty  i agree
with governor warsh that the markets would interpret this as that there may be more to come
and that we will mindful and watching what is going on  particularly in the context of the new
liquidity actions that we will be taking it is better to say that we are uncertain than to say that we
are uncertain with downside risks and then take these other actions  it is more appropriate for us
to convey that the combination of actions leaves us uncertain because that rather than
uncertainty with downside risks may help unlock some of these markets  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  the modal forecast suggests a cut of at least
25 basis points  in fact it indicates that we need to have further declines after that  as governor
kohn pointed out the 25 basis point cut still leaves us as somewhat restrictive  so we could just
sit at a 25 basis point cut and not move further and keep our options open  i think governor
kohn made a very good argument for that  however i do really worry about the significant
probability that things could go south in a vicious circle  in that context i think that the issue of
macroeconomic risk is really a severe one and an action of 50 basis points could help deal with
that risk  so i would prefer alternative a  if the committee were going that way which it is not
i would have added a sentence about high uncertainty because i think the balance of risk
sentence does create certain problems  there is a question about whether you should have that at
all  but if you have it in there in situations like this we definitely should emphasize the
uncertainty much more and use a sentence like the one that is in alternative b in that case
so let me just lay out this argument  would a 50 basis point cut matter  this is a
question that president fisher has asked  i think the answer is very much yes  it is not the
actual cut itself that matters it is the managing of expectations that really matters  in fact
whenever we make a 25 basis point cut and you ask how big an impact does that have on the
economy the answer is not a whole lot  that comes out of our simulations  it is really the
path of interest rates implied by our actions that is important  in particular the idea here of a
50 basis point cut is that by getting ahead of the curve we provide a signal to the markets that
we would be willing to take steps to react to events in the financial markets that might indicate
that we are getting into a viciouscircle type of situation  that is exactly what i felt we did in the
september meeting  that move was very successful and the markets really improved very
dramatically afterward  the signal we were sending at that point was that if things got much
worse we might have to do it again
now as i said we thought in october that things were looking pretty good  i thought we
had this great game plan we were on board for the game plan and of course the game plan is
unfortunately out the window  so i think that taking an action like a 50 basis point cut would
have an important impact and would provide the signals and the managing of expectations that
can have critical implications for how the economy evolves particularly how the credit markets
evolve  it also raises the issue that one thing we do need to do no matter what is to indicate to
the markets that we understand that our job is to prevent bad shocks from propagating in a very
bad way  we cant prevent the shocksbecause things happenbut our job is to make sure that
they dont propagate in a very bad way
the same issue comes up in terms of inflation  i have talked about the real side and the
justification for a 50 basis point cut in that case  but what about inflation  normally this
committee acts in a very inertial way and under normal conditions there are good reasons for
doing so in terms of the way you manage expectations about the term structure and so forth  but
thinking that way about operating in a situation of financial disruption is not the right way to
think  in fact the word that i really like in this context is governor kohns nimble which was
exactly the right word  you have to be nimble  what do i mean by that  well as all of us
completely agree keeping inflation expectations contained is the most critical thing that we do
we do need to worry about the real side of the economy but we know that if you unravel
inflation expectations then the jig is up and you get very bad monetary policy outcomes not
just for inflation but also for the real side of the economy  that is one of the key lessons that we
have learned in the past fifty years about monetary policy  so the question here is is this a
problem  well i dont see that there is a problem right now with inflation expectations getting
unhinged but it could happen and could happen quickly in the future  that says that we have to
be aware of this and possibly change policy very quickly and that the word is nimble  i dont
know if that is what you meant by nimble but i like the word  this requires that we reverse
course very quickly
now the problem that president plosser and others have raised is that the committee has
not acted that way in the past and that really is a serious concern of mine  there are ways to
operate differently on that which is to recognize that if you are going to reverse course you are
not going to do it on the basis of what is going on in the real economy or what is going on in
terms of actual inflation  just as right now our decision is really not so much about the incoming
economic data as much as it is about the problems in financial markets and the credit disruption
i think we are operating in a very proactive forwardlooking way  in that regard we would have
to act similarly in terms of thinking about inflation  there are two cases in which there would be
signals that we would have to act very differently  one is that credit conditions could improve
very quickly  we are hoping that this would happen and actually sometimes you do see these
things just turn around on a dime  all of a sudden a virtuous circle occurs  if that actually
started to happen it would be imperative if we did a 50 basis point cut that we reverse very
quickly on that action  second we have information about inflation expectations and if we saw
those numbers starting to go in a bad direction we should also operate very quickly in a
reversing direction  it is extremely important not to be in the taylorrule type of framework
where you wait to see actual inflation and output outcomes to drive your policy  it really has to
be much more proactive than that  there have been mistakes in the past at least in my
viewpoint when we could have reacted more quickly  for example in 98 it was very
appropriate for us to cut rates the way we did  but we were a bit slow to raise them and i think
part of the reason was that we were reacting more to what was going on  im not sureyou can
correct me in private afterward donbut i think that inertia was there and if we think about
doing things differently it could work out very well
i have to say that i do not worry about the political issue of the election  it is a change in
the way this committee operates but i believe that we can change  laughter  if we just think
about it and have a framework with which to think about it we could be much more nimble than
we were in the past
so let me finish  although i prefer alternative a i am going to accept alternative b  i
am perfectly happy with the language of alternative b because i think there is a lot of uncertainty
in the marketplace right now  in particular i feel that showing that the fomc has consensus in
a very difficult situation like this will be beneficial to the markets  if i were not willing to accept
alternative b it could create some problems in terms of the marketplace and i certainly am not
willing to do that  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you everyone  oh sorry  vice
chairman  laughter
vice chairman geithner  i support the reduction in the fed funds rate of 25 basis
points and the language in alternative b for almost all the reasons that were raised around the
table  i just want to say two quick things  one is that if we start acting as though we are
constrained by the political calendar of this country and choose to shade our judgments one way
or the other because of knowledge of that calendar i think it would be a dark day for the future
of the central bank  i also think that many of you are being a little unfair to the history of the
committee  i am not sure you can look at the evidence of monetary policy responses over the
last two decades and say that there is systematic evidence of a committee that is quick to lurch
down and slow and reluctant to tighten  if that were the case you would have had a level of
gdp volatility and a level of inflation expectations and a volatility of inflation expectations that
are substantially higher than they have been relative to central banks that operate with a different
kind of regime  i wasnt here for that period but i am a little surprised by the strength of the
conviction many of you have expressed that we have been systematically vulnerable as a
committee to that basic bias  but mr chairman i like this option and the language in it  i
think the choices ahead of us are going to be harder than this one  we may have some 50 basis
point moves ahead of us but i think at the moment this is the best of the alternatives
chairman bernanke  thank you  well again thank you thank you all  i do
think we need to move today  once we take into account the drag from financial conditions
arguably the current rate is neutral or even somewhat restrictive  for example the taylor rules
in the bluebook have the neutral rate between 4 and 4 percent  moreover there has been quite
a market change  whether you look at markets or look at simulations the frbus equilibrium
real funds rate for example is down 70 basis points since the last meeting which of course is
just a summary of the revision of the forecast  on the other hand you get similar numbers when
you look at actual market indicators  so i think there is a sense in which our policies become de
facto more restrictive and need to be addressed  on top of that there is some case for insurance
although the discussion around the table illustrates that that is a complex idea when you in fact
have a dual mandate and there are risks in both directions
if the choice were between 0 and 50 basis points i would be very tempted to do 50 basis
points  i think it would move us more toward accommodation and it would be very pleasant to
get the same kind of market response we got after september in terms of improved functioning
and credit extension  that said i think there are some risks to going with 50 basis points  i
acknowledge what others have said which is that it is not just about the rate but also about what
the message is  in particular the markets already expect us to ease quite a bit more  we are not
pushing strongly back against it with 25 basis points  if we do 50 we may be saying to the
market that we are willing to do even more than you currently expect  i think that poses some
risks to inflation expectations and poses some risks to the dollar which is a little fragile right
now  you can imagine it even having reverse effects with respect to the economyfor example
if it caused oil prices to jump or if it caused nominal interest rates to rise thereby raising nominal
mortgage rates  the other concern i have is that for better or worse given our communications
and market expectations at this point a 50 basis point cut would be viewed as something of a
lurch and might signal as others have suggested more concern or private information about the
economy that we in fact dont necessarily have  you can tell that i am quite conflicted about it
and i think there is a good chance that we may have to move further at subsequent meetings  in
that respect it is very important that both in our statement and in our intermeeting
communications that we signal our flexibility our nimbleness  we are not locked in we are
responsive to conditions on both sides of the mandate and we are alert to new developments
with all of that in mindand although i dont think the taf is really a significant
substitute for monetary policy on the margin i think it is helpfuli recommend 25 basis points
and alternative b  i did not hear much support for a downside risks sentence and i agree that
adding it would probably not very substantially affect the signal that we are sending today  so
that is my proposal  any comments  if not could you please call the roll
ms danker  the vote today encompasses the directive from the bluebook and the
language of alternative b that was in the bluebook and in the handout  the directive reads as
follows  the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun
objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent
with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent
chairman bernanke                yes vice chairman geithner         yes president evans                      yes
president hoenig                    yes
governor kohn                       yes
governor kroszner                 yes
governor mishkin                  yes
president poole                       yes
president rosengren               no
governor warsh                     yes
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  we need to recess briefly here for the
discount rate
meeting recessed
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we reconvene  again thank you all  let
me just reiterate what i was saying about the statement  i hope as we go through the
intermeeting period that we will try to maintain our flexibility  as we discuss the outlook in
public we should of course give our honest and full views on the outlook and the risks  but we
should try to maintain with respect to policy action flexibility in the ability to respond to new
conditions  that way i hope when we come to january we will be able to respond as the data
and the markets best indicate
we are no longer doing communications in our twoday meetings so there is a question
of what to do in that time  laughter  we would like to suggest several things to the
committee  first as part of the international processes and the efforts of the presidents
working group to study the lessons that we have gained so far from financial turmoil there are
numerous work streams going on about different aspects of the turmoil including a lot of work
being done by people in the system  so we would like to proposeand i hope that we would
consider it complementary to our policy discussiona presentation in january by the staff on
various policy lessons learned from the experience we have had with the financial turmoil
again this is material that will be feeding into international discussions about how policy
financial regulation and so on might respond to these situations in the future  the subsequent
twoday meeting is in april  the staff is working hard on the issue of interest on reserves  they
would like to present to us what they have done and get feedback from us on some parameters of
the process  it is in fact quite relevant to our current situation because it bears on issues of
monetary control  if we have interest on reserves we would for example be better able to
manage the overnight funds rate  so if there is no objection we would like to put that on the
schedule for april  subsequent to that we would like to go back to our practice of having
presentations on topics of interest  we would like to put special emphasis on research taking
place at reserve banks and we will be sending out a memo soliciting ideas from the committee
and from the reserve banks in the hope that individual banks in collaboration with others
might take the lead in making presentations of relevant research  so that is the current plan for
twoday meetings  are there any comments
okay  finally the next meeting is tuesday and wednesday january 29 and 30  we will
adjourn in a moment for lunch and over lunch laricke blanchard will give us a brief
presentation of congressional matters
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i make one point about january
which as you are all aware is that i dont think any of usand it is really not the staffwill be
in a position in january to provide a definitive set of convictions about really what worked what
didnt work what really contributed to it and what we did to the incentives that financial market
participants face  just to make sure that we dont raise expectations too much for the committee
i think that it will be at best an initial tentative diagnosis with some initial tentative sense of the
things we want to look at and that it will probably be the end of the beginning not the beginning
of the end of that process  laughter  is that okay mr chairman
chairman bernanke  i think it will be very interesting  president yellen
ms yellen  i just have a question  with respect to the implementation of the taf
could you clarify what we need to ask our boards of directors to do and when
chairman bernanke  can i get some help  scott
mr alvarez  i circulated to the general counsels yesterday resolutions that could be
presented to the boards of directors that adopt the result of the auction as the recommendation by
the reserve bank for the discount rate on the taf  the board would then be accepting those
and voting on them
ms yellen  do we have those  we have a meeting on thursday morning
mr alvarez  yes  the resolutions have all been circulated to all of the general
counsels of the reserve banks so they should have them and could be presenting them
ms yellen  but you are not circulating them to us
mr alvarez  i could give them to you
ms yellen  that would be nice laughter
mr alvarez  it is less for you to carry home
ms yellen  but general counsels normally dont participate in this process
chairman bernanke  he is not speaking to you  laughter
ms yellen  no he didnt speak to me
mr alvarez  i can send a copy to all the presidents
chairman bernanke  all right  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i just want to make sure that i heard you clearly earlier
we have kept this contained including the swap ranges which is very impressive  everybody
should pat themselves on the back  laughter  were broadening the circle tonight or this
afternoon and im not quite sure what your message is  i assume that we are announcing it
tomorrow morning because of the international complexities  nobody seems to know about this
yet that i am aware of  do you want us to inform our full boards or do you want us just to
inform our chairmen or do it late tonight or is it up to our discretion  i just worry about
leakage
chairman bernanke  we were asked whether it was okay to inform the boards
given that the boards are often privy to confidential information i didnt see any reason to
prohibit that  i think in some cases it might be a useful compromise instead just to inform your
chairman  but we are not requesting that you inform your board  it is up to you  if you think it
would be useful by all means  of course this will all be available first thing in the morning  so
if you prefer to call immediately after and discuss itany way that is good for you is fine with
us
mr fisher  i just wanted to make sure there wasnt a subtext to the message but ive
got it  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just to clarify what our boards have to approve as i understand it is the
willingness to accept the rate that comes out of the auction at the discount window
mr lacker  for the loans made at the facility
chairman bernanke  the discount window will still exist  they will still be
making loans at 50 basis points above the fed funds rate  this is a new facility approved by the
board  what your board has to approve is the willingness to make loans from your discount
window at the rate determined by the auction
mr plosser  that is what i understood  okay
vice chairman geithner  one clarifying thing and just a question for scott  is
it okay from your perspective if the recommendations come from boards of directors after the
announcement so long as they come before the first auction  so thursday would be fine
mr alvarez  they just have to be here by december 17
chairman bernanke  all right  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
