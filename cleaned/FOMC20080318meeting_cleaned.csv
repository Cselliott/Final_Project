transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on march 18 2008
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  let me extend a welcome to first
vice president sapenaro who is sitting in for st louis this morning  a quick comment on special
topics  im sure were all disappointed that we wont have further conversations on the
communications strategy laughter but that being the case we have the opportunity to have special
topics again  in april we will be discussing interest on reserves as we mentioned before  we asked
for suggestions for october and a number of banks proposed to look at inflation modeling which
seems obviously a good and policyrelevant topic  so that is what we propose to do in october
we look forward to reserve banks taking the lead on presentation and research in this area and
there will be meetings among the research directors and the system research advisory committee
to figure out how to go forward but obviously we have about seven months to get to that  we look
forward to having special topics  so the first item mr dudley if youre ready
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  to start i just want to update people on what happened overnight in markets  equities rebounded a bit in both asia and europe and bond yields reversed some of the decline that they saw on monday  the dollar was slightly weaker against the yen and the euro but still in the range that it established  it did not go back below the lows that it reached early on monday  i would say that generally the markets function was okay  the big issue was bank funding pressures in europe were evident for dollar funding  the funds rate bid as high as
3 percent which is quite surprising on the eve of a meeting in which we are likely to reduce the federal funds rate target  term funding pressures if you look at the one month or threemonth liborois spread are basically unchanged from monday when they were up quite sharply from last friday
before talking about what markets have been doing over the six weeks since the last fomc meeting im going to talk a bit about the bear stearns situation  in my view an oldfashioned bank run is what really led to bear stearnss demise  but in this case it wasnt depositors lining up to make withdrawals it was customers moving their business elsewhere and investors unwillingness to roll over their collateralized loans to bear  the rapidity of the bear stearns collapse has had significant contagion effects to the other major us brokerdealers for two reasons  first these firms also are dependent on the repo market to finance a significant portion of their balance

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
sheets  second the 2 per share purchase price for bear stearns was a shock given the firms 70 per share price a week earlier and its stated book value of 84 per share at the end of the last fiscal year  the disparity between book value and the purchase price caused investors to question the accuracy of investment banks financial statements more generally
the contrast in the behavior of investment bank equity prices versus credit default swap cds spreads is revealing  share prices fell sharply but the cds spreads narrowed a bit indicating a lower risk of default  for example lehmans stock price fell 19 percent but its cds narrowed by 20 basis points to 450 basis points yesterday  this underscores the difference between the 2 per share buyout price for bear stearnsless value than people thoughtand the introduction of the primary dealer credit facility pdcfa reduction in the risk that a liquidity problem could drive a firm into insolvency
i have a few words about the pdcf before moving to a discussion of market developments since the january fomc meeting  the pdcf should help to restore confidence among repo investors  it essentially creates a triparty repo customer of last resortus  when investors have concerns about the ability of a dealer to fund itself they are reluctant to roll over their own repo transactions  the reason is the fear that the clearing bank may not send their cash back the next morning when the overnight repos mature  this fear may not be misplaced  if the clearing bank is worried about whether investors will stay put the clearing bank may decide to keep the cash  in that case the investors would be stuck with the securities that collateralize the repo transactions  the pdcf should break that chain of worry by reassuring the clearing bank that the fed will be there as a lender to fund the repo transactions  the repo investors are reassured that the clearing bank will send back their cash the next day and thus are willing to roll over their repo transactions  at least thats the theory  as noted the pdcf should provide some comfort to the counterparties of these firms that these firms will in fact be able to fund their obligations  yesterday the major money market mutual fund complexes did roll their outstanding repos with the major investment banks  however the jury is still out on whether the pdcf will be sufficient to stabilize confidence
high use of the pdcf would result in a large increase in the amount of reserves added to the banking system  i think it is important to go on record on that because if that were to occur over the short run the new york desk might not be able to drain reserves sufficiently quickly to keep the federal funds rate from trading extremely soft to the target  we will make all efforts to make the short run as short as possible
but realistically there is a good chance that the federal funds rate could trade soft relative to the target especially through the end of the current reserve maintenance period  in fact yesterday we saw that although it started the day quite firm the funds rate crashed at the end of the day and the effective fed funds rate for the day was 269 percent  it depends in large part on the volume of use of the pdcf
stepping back from developments of the past few days recent weeks have been marked by rapid and at times disorderly deleveraging of financial holdings within the global financial system  as i discussed last week the most pernicious part of this unwinding has been the dynamic of higher haircuts missed margin calls forced selling lower prices higher volatility and still higher haircuts with this dynamic particularly evident in the mortgagebacked securities market
ill be referring to the handout from here  over the past six weeks we have surveyed a number of hedge funds and one reit about the haircuts they face for financing different types of collateral  as shown in exhibit 1 the rise in haircuts has been most pronounced in nonagency mortgagebacked securities  but even agency mbs have seen a significant widening of haircuts in recent weeks  the collateral funding pressures have been particularly evident for residentialmortgagebacked securities collateral  this is due to several factors including very unfavorable fundamentals for housing a high level of uncertainty about the ultimate level of losses and an overhang of product for sale both currently and prospectively  in our discussions with market participants unleveraged players have been unwilling to step in to buy cheap assets for several reasons  first there are few signs that housing is close to a bottom  second a significant amount of product sits in weak hands and thus could be dumped on the market  third this particular asset class has characteristics that exacerbate price volatility and therefore risk  for example when spreads widen and yields climb prepayment speeds slow  this extends duration
when the yield curve is upward sloping for longer maturities the rise in duration generates an increase in yields  the rise in yields also reduces housing affordability which puts further downward pressure on home prices increasing prospective losses on the mortgage loans that underpin the securities
signs of distress in this market include the following  first a sharp widening in optionadjusted mortgage spreadsas shown in exhibit 2 optionadjusted spreads for conforming fixedrate mortgages have widened considerably since the january 3031 fomc meeting though they have come in quite a bit over the past couple of days
thats good news  second jumbo mortgage spreads relative to conforming mortgages rates remain very wide  as shown in exhibit 3 this spread has averaged more than 100 basis points this year  the current yield on prime jumbo loans is around 7 percent a margin of about 3 percentage points over tenyear treasury note yields  third mortgage securities prices continue to fall  for example as shown in exhibit 4 the prices for aaarated tranches of the abx 0701 vintage continue to decline  fourth fannie mae and freddie mac reported large fourthquarter losses and their stock prices and cds spreads have performed accordingly exhibit 5  the sharp decline in the equity prices has made the companies reluctant to raise new capital despite the prospects of highermargin new business because additional share issuance at the current share prices would lead to massive dilution for existing shareholders  fifth the yield levels on many mortgagebacked securities have climbed significantly above the yield on the underlying mortgages that underpin the securities  this is the opposite of how securitization is supposed to work  this
phenomenon reflects the glut of supply of such securities on the market and the added risk premium attached to assets that are typically held on a marktomarket basis
although the residential mortgage market is the epicenter of the crisis distress  has been evident much more broadlywith the municipal market fully implicated in the period since the january meeting  the deleveraging process evident among financial intermediaries operating outside the commercial banking system has led to a widespread repricing of financial assets  when available leverage drops risk adjusted spreads have to rise for leveraged investors to earn the same targeted rate of return as before  this helps explain why the problems in the residential mortgage market have infected financial markets more generally leading to wider credit spreads exhibits 6 and 7 and lower equity prices exhibit 8 both in the united states and abroad  as leverage is reduced and spreads widen financial arbitrage implies that all assets should reprice  the riskadjusted returns from holding different asset types should convergerecognizing that the degree of leverage that is available in markets may differ across asset classes in accordance with divergences in price volatility liquidity transparency and other characteristics
of course the notion of convergence to equivalent riskadjusted returns is an equilibrium concept and we are not in equilibrium  the events of the past week underscore that point  but there are plenty of other examples of disequilibrium at work  for example for mortgagebacked securities the losses implied by the prices of the aaarated abx index tranches appear to be high even relative to the darkest macroeconomic scenarios  the municipal bond market is also a good example of how market valuations can become unusually depressed when supply increases rapidly  then the value inherent in the securities becomes broadly known this mobilizes new money and riskadjusted returns come back down relatively quickly term funding spreads also indicate greater stress within the financial system  as shown in exhibits 9 and 10 the spreads between onemonth and threemonth libor ois spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks even before bear stearnss demise  we are sitting today at 56 basis points for the onemonth liborois
spread and 77 basis points for the threemonth liborois spread about the same as yesterday morning
as you are all aware we have been active in responding to the growing market illiquidity  exhibit 11 illustrates the results of the taf auctions  note how propositions and the number of bidders have increased recently and the spread between the stopout rate and the ois rate has risen over the past few weeks  even before the primary dealer credit facility was implemented this weekend we were in the middle of a historic transformation in the federal reserve systems balance sheet we are increasing the supply of treasuries held by the public either outright or borrowed and reducing the supply of moreilliquid collateral held by the private sector  even excluding the uncertain impact of pdcf borrowing this shift will speed up noticeably over the next month or two  our current plans are to increase the size of the taf to 100 billion scale up the singletranche rp book to 100 billion renew and increase the size of the foreign currency swaps with the ecb and the snb
to 36 billion outstanding if fully subscribed and implement a 200 billion tslf program  exhibit 12 shows how these programs are likely to change the composition of the federal reserves soma portfolio  as can be seen when all the current programs are fully phased in by may treasury holdings will have shrunk to about  45 percent of the total portfolio down from about 97 percent last july
at the same time that financial markets have been under severe stress and the macroeconomic growth outlook has deteriorated the inflation news has also been disturbing  several marketbased indicators are adding to investors concerns about the inflation outlook  first commodity prices have increased sharply  as shown in exhibit 13 the increases have been concentrated in both energy and agricultural prices  of course subsidies to stimulate the production of ethanol from corn have been an important factor  by diverting corn production to this purpose the linkage between energy and grain prices has been significantly strengthened  second the dollar after a period of stability that lasted from middecember into february has begun to weaken anew exhibit 14  this has gotten considerable attention in the press and abroad as the dollar has hit new lows against the euro and has fallen below 100 against the yen  up to now the decline has generally been orderly and the downward slope of the broad real tradeweighted dollar trajectory shown in exhibit 14 has not changed much
the foreign exchange markets are clearly very skittish  in particular there has been considerable focus on china and the gulf cooperation council gcc countries and their willingness to maintain their pegs against the dollar  for china investors expect its crawling peg to move faster  as shown in exhibit 15 the chinese yuan is now expected to appreciate about 11 percent against the dollar over the next year up from an 8 percent pace at the beginning of the year  for the gcc countries there is speculation that some of these countries might decouple from the dollar  however on a oneyearforward basis market participants are currently building in only a couple of percentage points of expected appreciation
breakeven rates of inflation have continued to widen  as shown in exhibit 16 both the board staffs and the barclays measures have broken out above the ranges evident in recent years  it is difficult to differentiate how much this widening reflects a higher risk premium due to greater uncertainty about the inflation outlook versus higher expected inflation  but either way it is probably fair to say that inflation expectations have become less well anchored over the intermeeting period  i will say however that yesterday breakeven rates of inflation came down very sharplythe move was 15 to 20 basis points  today we are back in the range we were in but that is only today  shortterm rate expectations continue to move lower  as shown in exhibit 17 federal funds rate futures now anticipate a trough in yields a bit below
15 percent  the yields implied by eurodollar futures prices have also shifted sharply lower as shown in exhibit 18  the trough in yields is expected to be reached in late summer or early fall
our formal survey of primary dealers which we normally show you was conducted more than a week ago and it is clearly out of date these exhibits are included in the appendix to the handout  so let me focus on what the dealers expectations were as of yesterday  they changed quite a bit over the past week most dealers expect either a cut of 75 or 100 basis points  there are eight for 100 basis points ten for 75 basis points and two for 50 basis points  this compares with the slightly more than 100 basis points built into the april federal funds rate contract yesterday the april fed funds contract implied a 195 percent effective fed funds rate for the month
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the january 3031 fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  are there any questions for bill  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  may i say just one thing mr chairman  i want to point
out that not only has bill along with a whole range of people in new york and on the board staff
been working 24 hours a day for about five days not only did he write a terrific statement for the
fomc just now despite all of those other preoccupations but he sat with his wife through major
surgery on thursday and friday and with her as she recovered  just a remarkable terrific
performance  i compliment him and just note that the burden he has been carrying is considerable
even in comparison with the burden of so many others
chairman bernanke  we thank you  president lacker
mr warsh  youre still going to get questions apparently  laughter
mr lacker  i hope your wife is doing well
mr dudley  she is doing well thanks
mr lacker  first just about breakevens  breakevens came down a lot yesterday but
my understanding is the fiveyear fiveyear forwards did not come down nearly as much  i think
the figures i have are 3 basis points on the boards measure and just 11 on new yorks measure  is
that right
mr madigan  three is right on the boards measure
mr dudley  i dont have a number
mr lacker  i am concerned about this lateday softening problem with the primary
dealer credit facility  everything else we have done has been fairly straightforward to sterilize but
because with this the quantity is activated late in the day the funds are just going to flow into the
market  you know youre in the position of predicting something with a huge variance the takeup
on that  now this could unravel  if lateday softness becomes the norm because of the arbitrage
thats available to banks within the maintenance period for holding reserves this could erode our
ability to hold the target  now you people have been really creative about lending money so i was
wondering if maybe you could turn your creative talents toward this problem  the thing that comes
to mind is some mechanism for sucking up funds at the end of the day on an automated basis  the
natural thing would be for us to do sort of the opposite of repos late in the day for return the next
morning  have you given that some thought  are you working on that
mr dudley  we have given it some thought but the press of other business frankly
has overwhelmed us in the very short run  but i think it is a good point  i would say two things
about the primary dealer credit facility and our ability to keep the funds rate at the target  one if
this works the way we hope it works there are not going to be many people showing up at the
primary dealer credit facility  we hope over time nonebecause if we reassure the repo
investors that they can roll their repo we think that will dominate coming to the primary dealer
credit facility  so if this works out the way we imagine it could work the primary dealer credit
facility use will be very nominal so we wont have this issue  the second thing i would say is that
if people do come to the primary dealer credit facility and that leads to softness in the federal
funds rate by definition it will make the primary dealer credit facility less attractive because
remember the primary dealer credit facility cost is tied to the target federal funds rate not to where
the federal funds rate actually trades in the market  so that also will obviate some of that issue  but
look we havent done this before  we have now had one day of experience  were going to have
to work on the issues that you raised and were going to have to see how it goes frankly
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman could i just add one thing on this  i think
the delicacy of the whole triparty repo thing is hard to overstate  for better or worse mostly for
worse the full triparty repo market generally has spread over the last few years well beyond fed
eligible securities and until we get to the other side of this there is a lot of risk in that stuff on repo
that goes further out the eligible collateral quality spectrum  even in a world where confidence
comes back around the primary dealers as counterparties the thing is theres just some natural risk
that that stuff is going to have to be financed in some other form
the hardest thing in this balance now is to try to do something that doesnt increase the
incentives so that we become the counterparty to everybody  were trying to make sure that its a
backstop but not a backstop thats so attractive that they come and thats going to be a very hard
line to walk  i say that bill because just to lower expectations the necessary cost of the choice
weve made is that were going to take the risk that we end up funding a bunch of stuff like that and
the commitment to do that is the only way this helps  it is very hard to know  again even if
confidence holds there is a reasonable probability that some of that stuff is just going to have to
move into different forms and other hands and that could be a delicate transition particularly if
people read into that a broader loss of confidence in this stuff
the other thing thats important to point out is that it is just not realistic to expect even with
the force of the things that we announced on sunday night that we dont still have a wave of
deleveraging ahead of us  there is still just a huge part of the world that knows they are really long
on risk in a fragile environment and have not yet gotten to that point  with everything thats
happened in markets their leverage is going up as the world goes against them and theyre going to
want to keep bringing it down  that really is going to work against the effect of all the things were
doing  so just be prepared under the best of circumstances for a sustained period of substantial
fragility  but to underscore your point jeff we agree with your point and had been discussing in
what we thought was a slightly calmer world over the past two weeks exactly that mix of things
and well be on it together and consulting
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  yes i just want to emphasize that what we have done so far has had this
separability about it and except for the brief period in late august last year it has not threatened our
ability to manage the federal funds rate in a way we thought appropriate for the whole economy  if
we dont cure this problem soon it will become visible it will become well known it will get
priced in and to some extent it will overtake this committees deliberations in the sense that it
rather than our target rate will run the fed funds rate  i think that would be a fairly dangerous
outcome and it just strikes me that this is incredibly urgent
chairman bernanke  you make a good point president lacker  president fisher
mr fisher  more mundane questions but by the way bill thank you for your service
everybody agrees with what the vice chairman said and i hope you took note of it  now that ive
made you feel better i have just a very simple question  on the taf has the portion of foreign
participation gone down
mr dudley  i dont think there has really been a shift  theres no meaningful shift
mr fisher  so its still pretty much where it was
mr dudley  its high  it will be interesting now with the reintroduction of the swap
you know the ecb will essentially have a noncompetitive auction with us on this coming monday
it will be interesting to see how that affects the taf auction results
mr fisher  then the second question bill which i raised on the phone  i dont
remember an answer  is it correct that german bunds have now traded through treasuries in terms
of default risk and is that meaningful at all
mr dudley  i think there was a day that that might have happened but i dont really
know the answer to that  im not sure what that really means
mr fisher  thats my question  does it mean anything
mr dudley  if that were to happen im not sure what i would make of it  that would
probably reflect more whats going on between different countries in europe than to have anything
really to do with us versus germany  thats how i would interpret it
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  id like to commend the new york fed staff for what i know has been
a very difficult time over the past week  my question is almost the opposite of president lackers
he raises some interesting points but i wonder  given the stigma issues involved and whats just
happened with bear stearns you would think that borrowing at any kind of penalty rate for an
investment bank which arguably is more susceptible to runs than the typical commercial bank is
something that no one would take advantage of because of concerns about stigma  is there any
evidence that theres more stigma  how are the primary dealers viewing this and have they raised
concerns about confidentiality and what would be disclosed
mr dudley  yes we have certainly gotten questions about how this will be
disclosed  now there will be a disclosure  there will be a line item in the h41 release but it
will just show the total dollar amounts extended through this facility  it is all bid through the
new york district so the total primary dealer borrowing will be shown in that release  the
stigma issue is a legitimate issue and that is why we have to be very careful about how we talk
about this and take tremendous care not to disclose who or even what type of institution uses it
but at the end of the day if you cant fund your repo and your only choice is to come to the
pdcf that is probably what you are going to do
now to come back to vice chairman geithners point i think that is exactly right
though  the fact that to the extent that there is stigma they are not going to want to come and
that is going to reinforce the deleveraging process that is clearly under way as is the fact that
they just saw bear stearns go from a troubled but viable firm to a nonviable firm in three days
the lesson from that for a lot of firms is going to be oh i need more liquidity i need to be less
leveraged and that lesson from what happened to bear stearns isnt going to go away
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  im under the impressionbill you correct mein the earnings call
from the investment banks today and tomorrow the four remaining are going to do all they can
to destigmatize this facility with answers to the effect that we havent tapped the facility yet but
we would be very open to do it in the right circumstances and to provide some comfort that it is
not stigmatizing in their own minds  for the strongest of those firms to say that should provide
some halo for the rest  but to bills point i think we will have to evaluate that as we go
chairman bernanke  i think it is incumbent upon me to point out that the board
staff was also very involved and i mention brian madigan pat parkinson scott alvarez
deborah bailey and others as well  so it was very much a joint effort  other questions for bill
if not well turn to dave stockton  oh i am sorry we need a vote to ratify the open market
operations
mr kohn  i move that we ratify the open market operations
mr fisher  second
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  now to dave stockton
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  as you know we have made some very large changes to the economic projection in this roundso large in fact that we had to adjust the scale on the forecast evolution charts that we put in the back of the greenbook  obviously the most notable change has been our adoption of the view that the economy is moving into recession  i thought it would be helpful to briefly review this morning our reasons for making that call at this time  in addition i will lay out the rationale for the depth and duration of the weakness in real activity that we are now projecting  finally i will explain why with so much more projected slack in resource utilization inflation has on average been revised up from our january projection
we have noted on several occasions in the past few months that our decision to stick with a forecast in which the economy muddles through its current difficulties without falling into recession was a close call  well over the intermeeting period we continued to accumulate a bleak array of economic indicators  consumer confidence moved still lower and in the case of the reutersmichigan measure dropped to levels last registered in the early 1990s  regional indexes of business sentiment continued to deteriorate noticeably with steep drops in the measures reported for new york chicago and philadelphia  although the weakness was less pronounced in the national ism surveys the composite indexes for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing were below 50 in february  small businessesas reported in the survey conducted by the national federation of independent businessesand larger businessesas captured by the duke university survey of chief financial officers have turned very pessimistic  these indicators taken alone or even in limited combination might not be that troubling  but when viewed as a whole and especially when taken in conjunction with the many financial indicators that have been flashing recession signals for some time the pattern of recent readings is disturbing
furthermore recession signals are no longer limited to surveys and financial indicators  private payroll employment is estimated to have dropped 101000 in february and there were sizable downward revisions to earlier months that left employment showing declines in both december and january  industrial production dropped 05 percent in february and manufacturing ip fell 02 percent  the weakness in industrial production occurred not only in the series in which we use
production worker hours to estimate output but also in series where we have measures of physical product  for both payroll employment and industrial production diffusion indexes indicate that the weakness has been spread widely across industries this mornings data on housing starts also suggest little end in sight to the ongoing recession in housing  singlefamily starts fell more than 6 percent to 707000 units in february and permits dropped a similar amount  both figures were very close to our expectations  multifamily starts moved up to 360000 units but that figure follows some low figures late last year and we wouldnt attach much signal to that reading  moreover while i certainly am not going to try to predict what the nber will ultimately do a number of the series consulted by the dating committee appear to have peaked late last year or early this yearat least on the currently published data  real personal income industrial production payroll employment and real manufacturing and trade sales all have local peaks sometime between october and january  all told the evidence of a serious weakening of the economy appears to us more palpable now than it did in january
if one grants that the economy from time to time exhibits nonlinear behavior then our forecast will need nonlinear changes to avoid making outsized errors  at this point weve seen enough to make us think that recession is now more likely than a period of weak growth and that is what we are forecasting  but having made that discontinuous change to our projection i want to impress upon the committee just how much this remains a forecast of recession a lot has to happen that we havent seen yet to be confident of this call
indeed there are several reasons to be skeptical that we have transitioned into recession  one striking feature of several surveys of business sentiment is that businesses appear more pessimistic about the overall economic picture than they do about the prospects for their own firms  another cautionary reading comes from the motor vehicle sector  sales have softened noticeably over the past couple of months but they havent tumbled as they might have if the economy had already moved into recession  in labor markets initial claims for unemployment insurance which had risen earlier in the year have leveled off of late with the fourweek average running about 360000 in recent weeks  that level of claims is not yet high enough to clearly signal the declines in private payrolls of between 150000 and 175000 that we expect will be occurring this spring  finally orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods flattened out late last year but as yet have not shown any signs of serious deterioration which will be necessary shortly if our projected downturn in capital spending is to come to pass  for now we are willing to treat these readings as suggesting that there is some upside risk to our forecast of a modest recession
one of the key features of past recessions as viewed through the lens of our models is a tendency to observe large negative residuals that are correlated across the major spending equations  we have built that feature into this projection  but this also remains a forecast because a pattern of correlated negative residuals is not yet clearly evident in the data  to gain some perspective on how the forecast would have looked had we not built in these recession effects we showed an alternative scenario
in the greenbook that effectively removed these residuals  the result is a forecast that is similar to though in the near term a bit weaker than the one we showed in the january greenbook largely because of higher oil prices and weaker housing prices
but we have marked down the baseline forecast considerably more than would be suggested by these factors alone
to be sure we may have overreacted by moving to a recession call  but that possibility is counterbalanced by some clear downside risks even relative to this more pessimistic forecast  the recession that we are forecasting is relatively shallow  in our forecast the depth of the downturn is limited in the near term by tax rebates which provide a substantial boost to disposable income starting in may  this should help to buffer some of the drag on spending that is anticipated to result from declining employment higher oil prices and weaker household net worth  moreover domestic production benefits appreciably from the past and prospective decline in the exchange value of the dollar and the continued growth in the economies of our major trading partnersfactors that help to provide a sizable boost to net exports this year and next these influences result in a small upturn in real gdp in the second half and the unemployment rate rises only 1 percentage points to 5 percent  that is a small increase in unemployment even by the standards of the past two mild recessions  as ive noted welltimed macro policies and substantial support from the external sector lead us to expect that this time will be different and that the unemployment rate will rise less than usual  but you should always be wary of forecasts that expect this time to be different
another notable feature of our forecast is that although the projected downturn in activity is shallow the period of weak aggregate demand is lengthy especially given the assumed low level of the real funds rate  for those of you so inclined this might be a good time to check your blackberries for email or to get in a couple of games of brickbreaker because i can assure you that i will not be offering much in the way of scientific insight on this issue  in our forecast the growth of real gdp picks up next year for several reasons  housing demand finally bottoms out and accordingly construction activity begins to arrest its steep decline  in addition given our forecast of a flattening of crude prices the drag from higher oil prices on consumer spending is expected to wane next year  importantly we also assume that there will be a gradual lifting of the restraint on spending as financial stress abates
the last influence is now assumed to lift more gradually than in our previous forecast and along with an intensifying drag from lower house prices accounts for much of the lingering weakness in this projection  correspondingly the unemployment rate falls to only 5 percent at the end of 2009  in our previous forecast we had the effects of financial stress fading over this year on the thought that as it became apparent that the economy would avoid recession and that housing was bottoming out risk spreads would narrow credit conditions would loosen up and spending restraint would ease  obviously in our current forecast the economy experiences recession this year and housing doesnt show much sign of stabilizing until next year as a consequence we dont begin to phase out the unusual restraint on spending resulting from financial stress until next year
this aspect of our forecast even more than others is largely guesswork  we just dont have much in the way of historical experience on which to calibrate the projection  in recognition of that uncertainty we included in the greenbook two alternative simulations  in the faster recovery alt sim we assume a stabilization of housing later this year and a reversal of most risk spreads by the middle of next year under these assumptions growth picks up more noticeably and a tightening of monetary policy is required next year  alternatively one cannot rule out some further deterioration in financial conditions and an even longer period of subpar economic performance  in the greater housing correction with more financial fallout scenario a steeper decline in home prices results in a deeper contraction in construction activity a further widening of risk spreads tighter lending conditions and an additional deterioration in household and business sentiment  although this scenario might sound extreme it only pushes the outer edge of the 70 percent confidence interval for real gdp and unemployment  it is also sobering to recognize that this simulation results in a nominal funds rate path that skirts the zero bound
the bottom line  we know with probability 1 that the baseline forecast will be wrong  but with the downward adjustments that we have made to this forecast we feel that there is significant probability mass on both sides of our projection
despite marking down our forecast of real activity substantially this round our projection of consumer price inflation both headline and core has been revised up in 2008 and is largely unchanged in 2009  those revisions reflect marginally worse news on the incoming price data as well as further deterioration in some of the key determinants of price inflation  as for the news our reading of the recent price figures is that core pce prices probably did not rise as rapidly in january as is currently published but that they likely rose faster in february than might be suggested by a cursory examination of last fridays cpi report  as we noted in the greenbook barring offsetting influences we believe that the currently reported increase in core pce prices of 03 percent in january will be revised down to 02 percent after the bea incorporates the low reading on medical care services that was shown in the january ppi  as for february the core cpi being unchanged was a favorable development  but a sizable fraction of the good news was in rents and medical care rents receive a much smaller weight in pce prices than in the cpi and as i just noted the pce price index uses the ppi not the cpi for measuring medical costs  incorporating medical care prices from this mornings ppi release suggests to us that core pce prices rose about 015 in february  all told we are projecting an increase in core pce prices of 25 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter 01 percentage point more than in january
we have also incorporated into this forecast a further jump in the cost of crude oil and higher import prices associated with the weaker dollar and morerapid gains in commodity prices  moreover we have read the survey measures and tips spreads as suggesting that there may have been some deterioration in inflation expectations of late  taken together these less favorable developments more than offset the projected emergence of some slack in resource utilization  as a consequence we are
now projecting core pce prices to rise 23 percent this year up  percentage point from our january projection  despite an unemployment rate that runs nearly
 percentage point above our previous forecast we have left unrevised our projection of core pce prices in 2009 at 19 percent  higher food and energy prices have resulted in a further upward revision to total pce price inflation of nearly
 percentage point to 29 percent in 2008  total pce price inflation for 2009 is unrevised at 17 percent
before turning the floor over to nathan i want to let the committee know that the three research divisions are undertaking a review of the structure of our policy documents  the greenbook and bluebook have grown in length and complexity over the past decade  our objective in this review will be to improve the focus and flow of the documents and to eliminate the redundancy that has crept in over time so as to reduce the burden on you in reading the documents and the burden on the staff of producing them  we will of course consult with the committee before implementing any substantive changes  nathan will now continue our presentation
mr sheets  the global economy has likewise seen some extraordinary developments during the intermeeting period  notably the spot price of wti has surged more than 15 percent briefly reaching 110 per barrel and many nonfuel commodities prices have moved up by similar magnitudes  the exchange value of the dollar which had been relatively stable since november has returned to a depreciating path falling more than 5 percent against the major currencies since mid february and reaching a postbretton woods low  the global financial stresses that began last summer have further intensified  also as dave has outlined recent data suggest that the us economy has continued to weaken  nevertheless not all the news from the foreign sector has been grim  indeed given the shocks that have materialized the foreign economies appear to be showing somewhat more resilience than we would have expected
total foreign real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of last year stepped down to
32 percent from the rapid 45 percent rate that had prevailed through the previous three quarters as the pace of activity slowed in both the advanced economies and the emerging market economies  this fourthquarter outturn however was about
 percentage point stronger than we had expected reflecting an upside surprise in the emerging markets  available indicators of firstquarter activity paint a mixed picture in the euro area economic sentiment fell in february for the ninth consecutive month but the purchasing managers index for the services sector and the german ifo index of business conditions picked up  in addition industrial production and retail sales posted stronger readings in january  the ecbs banklending survey indicates a tightening of lending standards but measures of bank credit to the corporate sector have continued to expand  indicators of activity in the united kingdom have also been mixed  consumer confidence in february slid to a fiveyear low but business confidence and conditions in the services sector have been more upbeat  in emerging asia while the impetus from external demand is clearly diminishing chinese retail sales have continued to grow robustly industrial production in korea singapore and
taiwan moved up in january and domestic consumption in the asean countries has remained solid  taken together these data seem to indicate that growth abroad has cooled but has not stalled
our forecast thus seeks to balance several offsetting considerations  on the one hand the projection for us growth this year has been cut by a sizable 1 percentage points this has particularly stark implications for countries like canada mexico and some in emerging asia that have close trade ties with the united states  the further deterioration in global financial conditions should also weigh on activity abroad  on the other hand the incoming data suggest that the foreign economies are not yet following the united states into recession and the redhot commodities markets also lead us to believe that activity is holding up in some corners of the world
weighing these factors we have cut our forecast for total foreign growth in 2008 to 23 percent down from 29 percent in the last greenbook with much of this markdown reflecting softer growth in canada and mexico  our projections for emerging asia have also been reduced but we see these economies still expanding at a moderate pace  clearly there are both upside and downside risks around this forecast  on the downside the adverse spillovers from the us slowdown and continued financial stresses may be more severe and more broadly felt than we envision  on the upside the apparent resilience in foreign demand to date suggests the possibility that growth abroad may hold up better than we now expect  in 2009 foreign growth is projected to rebound to 3 percent in line with the expected easing of global financial stresses and economic recovery in the united states
with commodities prices increasing sharply foreign inflation has continued to rise  notably in the euro area 12month headline consumer price inflation climbed to 33 percent in february well above the ecbs 2 percent ceiling driven up by food and energy prices  in china 12month inflation in february surged to 87 percent at least in part reflecting sharp increases in food prices due to severe winter weather  in an effort to temper these pressures the chinese authorities have introduced temporary price controls for some basic necessities and this morning announced plans to raise reserve requirements another 50 basis points  we now see average foreign inflation in 2008 as coming in at around 3 percent up  percentage point from the last greenbook
central banks have responded to this cocktail of slowing growth and higher thandesired inflation in divergent ways  to date the ecb has held its policy rate firm at 4 percent citing the level of headline inflation possible secondround effects from commodity price increases and risks from ongoing wage negotiations  given these concerns we now expect the ecb to remain on hold a while longer but in response to a projected further slowing of activity to cut rates 50 basis points later this year  the bank of england in contrast has reduced its policy rate 50 basis points since the falland we expect another 75 basis points by yearendin an effort to cushion the economy against financial headwinds and slowing in the housing and commercial real estate sectors  finally the bank of canada has reduced rates
100 basis points since the autumn in response to downdrafts from the united states and the strong canadian dollar and the bank has indicated that further monetary stimulus is likely to be required  thus we see another 50 basis points of easing in the second quarter
as noted earlier the dollar has depreciated more than 5 percent against the major currencies since midfebruary as the widening divergence between the path of policy rates in the united states and other industrial countries particularly the euro area has weighed on the dollar  as a related factor the tone of the recent us economic data has been much softer than for most other advanced economies  in broad real terms the path of the dollar in our current forecast is about 2 percent weaker than in the january greenbook  going forward our forecast calls for the broad real dollar to decline at a 3 percent annual rate with this depreciation expected to come disproportionately against the currencies of the emerging market economies
i conclude with a few words regarding the performance of the us external sector  the january trade data showed exports continuing to rise at a healthy pace while nonpetroleum imports contracted  imports of consumer goods were particularly soft  for 2008 as whole we now expect the external sector to contribute a substantial 12 percentage points to growth about twice as much as in our previous forecast  to be sure much of this larger arithmetic contribution from net exports reflects a contraction in imports caused by the slowdown in us demand  however part of the reduction in imports is also due to the decline in the dollar  exports this year are seen to grow at a pace of nearly 7 percent just a touch less than in the last greenbook as the effects of the weaker dollar almost offset the markdown in foreign growth  in 2009 imports rebound as the us economy recovers and the positive contribution from net exports accordingly shrinks to about  percentage point
finally yesterday the bea reported that the current account deficit narrowed to
49 percent of gdp in the fourth quarter its smallest share of gdp since 2004  we had expected the rise in oil prices to drive up the deficit but this was more than offset by a marked improvement in net investment income partly as earnings received by foreigners on their investments in the us financial sector declined reflecting the effects of the ongoing financial turmoil  we will now be happy to take your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions  president fisher
mr fisher  if i put the two comments together one of the messages i receive is that
we are less confident in the linkage between us slowing growth and restofworld slowing
growth than we or conventional wisdom was before  you mentioned in the discussion of the
international side the downside and upside on growth  there is also a downside and an upside
on inflation  i just want to ask about our thoughts on this from a staff standpoint  clearly the
downside price pressures come from our housing crisis and all of the other related issues and i
presume from the building of slack and rising unemployment and therefore restrained wage
demands  that is the domestic side  at the same time i think i hear you saying that on the
global side it is not happening in that fashion elsewhere  the emerging countries particularly
china are still growing at a rapid pace  however it may become somewhat slower  my
question is do we feel that there is as much an offset to our domestic disinflationary
deflationary forces as we thought before  are these global demandpull inflationary forces
basically mitigating our expectations of the contractionary domestic forces  how has your
opinionthe two of youchanged in the intermeeting period  i hope that is a clear question
but i think you get the point that i am making
mr sheets  over the intermeeting period we have lived through an experience that
manifests the upside risk to our inflation forecast and i would indicate that with the
 percentage point markup to headline foreign inflation in 2008 in our forecast the vast majority
of that is a reflection of these redhot commodity markets which then presses the question to us
well what is going on there  certainly in the case of the demand in these markets by now i
would have expected to have seen some attenuation or a bit of softening  really it seems to be
quite the opposite  the demand since the first of the year has accelerated  some other factors
are at work as wellidiosyncratic supply stories electrical outages that made it harder to smelt
aluminum and copper and so on  so there are some supply factors as well  the demand side
seems to be important and to the extent that demand remains strong i am not sure where these
commodity prices are going to top out  the futures path is a reasonable guess at sort of the
balance of supply and demand  there is also some upward pressure on these prices from the
depreciation of the dollar  but to the extent that commodity prices move up i would say that we
will probably be marking up our forecast of foreign inflation next time
just a broader comment on the linkages between the us and the foreign economies
again i was surprised at the strength of demand in these commodity markets  i would have
expected by this point to have seen more marked evidence of slowing in the foreign economies
so we have marked down our forecast for 2008 in line with these prospective developments the
further slowing in the united states and the financial stresses  but we didnt mark down our
forecast very much just a tenth or two and mainly in canada in q1 and the data that we have in
hand are not pointing to a dramatic slowing  we are expecting more of that to come through in
the second and the third quarters
mr stockton  president fisher i will just basically reiterate what i said earlier and
amplify many of the same things that nathan just said in terms of the influences on our headline
forecast  we revised up  percentage point as well and that really is coming from higher energy
prices higher food prices and higher commodity prices all of which we think are already
showing through to some extent and we expect to continue to show through to headline inflation
despite the fact that we run with a much larger output gap in this forecast we havent revised
down our forecast for 2009 because of the lingering effects of the runup in commodity prices
that we are expecting  as i indicated we think there has probably been some small deterioration
in inflation expectations as well
mr fisher  thank you very much  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  dave my question is basically about the influence of the financial stress
on the outlook  i was talking to an official at the bank of canada last week and she had an
intriguing calibration by which she said that since last august they thought that financial stress
for canada was worth about 25 basis points of restraint at the outset and now they thought it was
more like 50 basis points for their economy which is doing quite well  i guess the impossible
question is have you thought about that type of calculation and how it influences the way we
think about interest rates for your forecast  the way that i am thinking about this and that
president lacker and others have thought about this is that we are trying to separate the effects of
standard monetary policy and of the innovative policies  any separation that affects financial
markets directly helps us think about the more normal calibration of policy  but of course with
financial stress we have these addon effects  so that is why i think that would be interesting
mr stockton  we have thought about that and the difficulty at this point is trying
to identify the truly exogenous features of the current financial stress that is operating over and
beyond the channels that are normally incorporated in our models  our models obviously have
asset prices such as house prices and stock prices and have interest rates and interest rate
spreads and as those things have changed we have been able to incorporate them into our
forecast  but then over and above that we think that the model doesnt really capture a lot of
the creditavailability channels  there is a lot more stress in the market beyond that captured by
the interest rates in our models  so taking this with more than a grain of salt we think roughly 
percentage point on the level of gdp this yearover and beyond the effects of lower house
prices the weaker stock market and the higher interest rate spreadsthat basically lingers on
into next year and only then begins to gradually phase out  that is an important factor as to why
this forecast is based on such a low real federal funds rate  obviously if you came to a different
conclusion either about the depth of what is likely to be occurring in the next few months in
terms of the restraintnot just from these financial stress conditions but also from our call that
we are moving into a recessionor about the way that restraint fades out over the forecast that
would have a huge influence on the projected path for the funds rate  so it is important to
recognize that this forecast is conditioned on one in which those effects linger quite significantly
into next year
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not we will begin our economic go
round  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i thought i would talk a bit about some
events in our region that i think have global implicationsthat is to say i will talk a bit about
agriculture  you have heard others here this morning talk about some of the price movements
and i think it is worth perhaps spending a few minutes on their effects  first of all agricultural
commodity prices have surged to record highs driven by obviously strong demand lean
supplies and a weak dollar  since the fall of 2007 winter wheat prices have doubled and corn
and soybean prices have risen about 70 percent to record highs  rising crop prices are boosting
farm income  in real terms us net farm income is expected to climb to the second highest
level on record trailing only 1972 when abrupt sales of us wheat to russia pushed up farm
income
an emerging concern is the growing disarray in futures markets for agricultural
commodities caused by a surge in investment by index and hedge funds going forward  recent
reports indicate that hedge and index fund investment in futures markets for corn soybeans and
wheat rose from 10 billion in january 2006 to 45 billion this past january  early this month
index funds held more than 40 percent of the long positions on wheat contracts on the chicago
board of trade  at this rapid pace of investmentsince the beginning of this year averaging
1 billion per weekthe funds would own the nations entire 2008 corn wheat and soybean
crops by early 2009  now that is obviously theoretical but that is how much money is going
into this market  the resulting market disarray is constraining the traditional use of commodity
futures to hedge market risk  grain elevators which use futures to hedge their contracts to
purchase crops from producers for future delivery are facing much larger than normal margin
calls on their futures positions  some reports indicate that lenders are beginning to restrict their
funding of elevator hedges  as a result an increasing number of elevators are limiting their
contracts for crop purchases to no more than sixty days in advance of the delivery instead of the
normal one to two years
now this surge in crop prices and farm income is pushing up farmland values
according to our banks agricultural credit survey in the fourth quarter of 2007 nonirrigated
cropland values jumped 20 percent over 2006 levels with strong gains also reported in irrigated
cropland and ranchland  our directors and other contacts report a further strong gain since the
beginning of the year and some have reported as much as a 20 percent increase in the first
quarter alone  adjusted for inflation the average price of farmland across the nation now tops
the early 1980s peak which immediately preceded the plunge in the early to mid 1980s
to date crop production budgets suggest that the recent runup in farmland values is
supported by current revenues from crop production  however farm input costs have also risen
sharply driven by higher energy costs suggesting that a drop in crop prices could quickly erode
farm cash flow and undermine these values  district bankers report a surge in farm capital
spending  in february sales of fourwheeled major equipment rose 45 percent above 2007
levels and combine harvester sales were up 13 percent  farm equipment prices have risen
sharply and our directors and other contacts report that some equipment dealers are rationing
purchases among their customers  in the past month anecdotal reports from district contacts
indicate that nonfarm investors have boosted their farmland purchases  our contacts at a
national farm management company based in omaha stated that the number of inquiries for
farmland purchases by corporate interests has jumped significantly recently  similarly one of
our directors reported that a hedge fund with assets of more than 7 billion is expected to invest
500 million in cropland from texas and nebraska  this fund recently purchased nearly 25
square miles of corn acreage in western nebraska
now we continue to watch for signs of rising leverage but to date farm debt levels have
risen modestly only and agricultural banks seem to remain healthy  bankers report continued
use of cash to finance farmland purchases but i would note that leverage is being brought into
the picture and i think that will accelerate as opportunism and greed have their way  total farm
lending in the district banks has increased a modest 14 percent over the past four years with
most of that growth being in farm real estate lending  but district bank examiners and
respondents to our surveys reported that the farm credit system was being more aggressive in
funding farm real estate transactions  real estate mortgage loans held by the farm credit
system rose about 12 percent in 2007  asset quality at our ag banks remains at this point solid
noncurrent assetsall assets not just farm loansat ag banks are up only slightly from a year
ago and remain well below historical averages  net loan losses are still very low  earnings have
remained solid primarily because of cost control and very low loss provisions  i am very
pleased but i will tell you that going forward in terms of the surveys with the kinds of pressure
and price appreciation going on i think the push for leverage is just beginning
at the national level in terms of the greenbook every indication is that the economy is
slowing  whether it is recession or very slow growth is a matter of degree but i think our
projections are in the same direction as the greenbook
turning to the inflation outlook i am concerned as i have said before about the upside
risk to inflation  though i certainly agree with others around the table that weaker economic
activity may put some downward pressure on goods price inflation i think we can also agree that
a number of factors could push inflation higher including rapidly rising commodity prices
worldwide and a weaker dollar  as discussed in the bluebook there is some indication that
inflation expectations may be moving higher as well  as i have indicated before i am
increasingly concerned that in our need to respond to signs of economic weakness we risk
losing our hardwon credibility on inflation  for the past four years core pce inflation has
averaged about 21 percent considerably above the numbers that this committee has put forward
in its longterm projections  frankly i do not think that many people outside this room think
that this committee can deliver the longerrun projections that we have put forward  i dont
think that we can keep inflation expectations anchored only by talk if actual inflation rises
further in the months ahead and we continue to ease policy in a rising inflationary environment
this is something that we need to keep in mind as we discuss our policy options today  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  since our last meeting the economic
data have continued to indicate a very weak economy and that in all likelihood we have entered
a recession  like the greenbook my outlook is particularly influenced by indications of
significantly weaker labor markets and a housing market that is as yet showing no signs of
reaching bottom  private payroll employment fell 101000 in february and the sum of the
downward revisions in december and january was about the same magnitude  not only have we
had three months of declining private payroll employment but also the decline has been
widespread across most industries  the blue chip economic forecast the greenbook forecast
and our own forecast have the unemployment rate peaking somewhere between 5 and
6 percent  while most analysts are in the process of downgrading their forecasts from skirting to
actually having a mild recession the risk of a more severe downturn is uncomfortably high
a major determinant of the severity of a downturn will be the housing market  because
recent developments in the housing market are so different from most postwar history i remain
very concerned that the effects of substantial declines in housing prices will be difficult to
capture in statistical models based on historical data  the caseshiller index indicates that
housing prices fell approximately 10 percent in 2007 and a decline of similar magnitude this
year would mean that many homes purchased in the past several years are in a negative equity
position  elevated foreclosures and large inventories of unsold properties are providing
abundant opportunities to purchase homes at heavily discounted prices financed at low interest
rates by historical standards  but widespread concerns that prices will continue to fall have
resulted in many prospective buyers deferring purchase decisions  to date the housing market
has been quite weak despite relatively low unemployment rates  but if our forecasts are right
job losses this year are likely to exert a significant further drag on housing prices as rising
unemployment rates force additional home sales or foreclosures  falling housing prices are
likely to have a collateral impact on consumption  perhaps reflecting this risk the credit default
swap rates on retailers have been rising and we are increasingly hearing of retailers that are
closing stores or postponing expansions  retailers like consumers are aware that high oil
prices increasing job losses and losses of wealth in the stock and housing markets are not likely
to be conducive to robust consumption
exacerbating the negative economic news is the continued deterioration in financial
markets  credit spreads have widened significantly over the past six weeks with many spreads
more than 50 basis points higher than at the last meeting  hedge fund and money managers that
i talk to are acutely aware of the counterparty risk and are very carefully managing their
collateral  most firms with excess collateral are in the process of managing that position down
the deleveraging that is going on has reduced the willingness of banks and other financial
intermediaries to finance their positions  in addition as concerns with liquidity rise we are once
again seeing renewed pressure on the assetbacked commercial paper market  the rise in credit
default swaps for companies like washington mutual and lehman brothers indicates increased
concerns for the solvency of other large financial institutions with large exposures to mortgages
the potential for a further episode of financial market dysfunction and for runs on additional
financial firms is significant  my primary concern at this time is that we could suffer a severe
recession  falling collateral values and impaired financial institutions can significantly
exacerbate economic downturns
some indicators of inflation are higher than we want but during previous recessions
commodity prices and inflation rates fell  given my forecast for the economic outlook i expect
substantial excess capacity to significantly reduce inflationary pressures going forward and i see
little evidence that higher commodity prices are causing upward pressures on wages and salaries
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  since we met at the end of january there has
been an utter dearth of good news concerning both the real and the financial sides of the
economy  on the real side i just cant recall any intermeeting period in which nearly every
single data point was dismal  on the financial side there have been occasional good days but
the net changes over the intermeeting period have been negative across the board in both the
equity and the credit markets so financial conditions have unambiguously tightened  these
developments are familiar to all of us and i wont take up time to review the specifics
my overall sense at this point is that the effects of the severe and prolonged housing
downturn the financial market implosion and the price increases for oil and other commodities
have now spread to most corners of the economy including the major segments of consumption
and business fixed investment  exports represent about the only source of strength and while
that is welcome i must say that the economy is pretty clearly in trouble when the contribution to
real gdp growth from exports exceeds overall real gdp growth as may well happen this year
the bottom line is that like nearly everyone else i have downgraded my economic outlook
substantially  assuming that the stance of policy is eased substantially at this meeting and
additionally by midyear i see the economy as essentially in recession during the first half before
picking up somewhat in the second because of the effects of monetary and fiscal policy
however i certainly see large downside risks to my forecast and i think the greenbooks
view that recessionary nonlinearities have already set in seems to me to be within a reasonable
range of outcomes  in fact we have also been looking at monthly data on coincident business
cycle indicators and that examination suggests to us that the nber may well date the beginning
of the recession to last november
the prospect of this outcome has been made more palpable for me by the rather sudden
increase in the frequency and intensity of pretty dire comments i am hearing from my contacts
first i have heard widespread reports of reductions in capital spending plans due to caution or
pessimism regarding economic growth  for example a large manufacturer and retailer of
outdoor sports equipment reported that technology and infrastructure spending has been cut by at
least a third in 2008  in another example a large player in commercial real estate in the san
francisco bay area described how projects are being canceled because the financing spigot has
been shut  indeed nonresidential construction is one sector where i think the greenbook may be
too optimistic  i envision growing weakness there
second my retail contacts suggest that spending has softened further in the wake of a
weak holiday season and expectations are for continued weakness at least through spring  for
example the ceo of a large highend national retail operation reports that for january and
february he has seen declines in sales that havent been experienced for almost fifteen years
these declines have created tremendous pressure on inventory levels requiring large markdowns
with negative effects on profits  vendors are reeling from the cancellation of orders the return
of goods and sharp reductions in new orders
third a number of contacts have provided comments reinforcing the view that a
significant credit crunch is under way  slightly more than half of the comments received on this
topic indicate that credit standards have tightened significantly in recent months  in one
example the ceo of a bank in my district reports that several of the nations largest mortgage
lenders have suspended withdrawals from open home equity lines out of concern that borrowers
could now owe more than their homes are worth  as a final anecdote a banker in my district
who lends to wineries noted that highend boutique producers face a distinctly softening market
for their products although sales of cheap wine are soaring  laughter
now let me turn to inflation and inflation expectations  of course much of the recent
data have been disappointing having been pushed up by rising energy and other commodity
prices  though i was heartened by fridays cpi report this one observation hasnt changed my
overall impression that prospects for core inflation this year have worsened a bit since we met in
january and i have raised my projection for core pce inflation about  percent in 2008 to
2 percent  these data raise the issue of whether cutting rates as much as needed to fight a
recession may risk persistently higher inflation and inflation expectations  but i tend to think
this risk is manageable
first as i have said before i view inflation as less persistent now than it once was
tending to revert fairly quickly to its longerrun trend  we have recently reviewed and updated
our econometric evidence for this and found it to be even more convincing now than it was a
couple of years ago  of course it is important to remember that the current lack of persistence
presumably is due to our enhanced credibility so we do have to be careful to maintain it  recent
increases in inflation compensation in treasury markets highlight the risk that our attempts to
deal with problems in the real economy possibly could lead to higher inflation expectations and
an erosion of our inflation credibility  but inflation compensation is just one indicator of
inflation expectations  i very much like the board staffs approach which is in the current
bluebook of combining the information from a wide variety of indicators into a principal
componenttype model  i found it reassuring that the resulting index of inflation expectations
and uncertainty is still within the range of variation that we have seen over the past decade or so
second i tend to think that developments in labor compensation are an important part of
the transmission process for monetary policy to inflation  before we get into too much trouble
with inflation and inflation expectations i would expect to see labor compensation begin to rise
more rapidly  i find it reassuring that both our broad measures of compensation have expanded
quite moderately over the past year and productivity growth has been fairly robust  so after
incorporating its effects unit labor costs are up less than 1 percent over the past four quarters
finally the more pronounced slowdown that i expect for economic activity is likely to
put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward  overall i expect core pce
inflation to fall below 2 percent next year under an assumed leveling out of energy and other
commodity prices and the projected weakening of labor and product markets
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well the baseline forecast in the greenbook
looked to me a lot like the 2001 recession experiencevery brief and very mild  if things turn
out that way we will have been very fortunate frankly  the forecast i submitted at the last
meeting was lower than most around the table and now my bottom line is that i think the
recession that if we are not in we are confronting is more likely to resemble that of 199091
which while brief wasnt that mild  there were a couple of quarters as i recall where the
economy contracted by at least 3 percent in real terms  i am not sure that this recession is likely
to be as brief as the previous two either  i have tried to use the 199091 experience and its
aftermath as sort of a guide to thinking about where we are today and how things might unfold
and evolve because there are some significant similarities as well as some significant differences
between the periods  but it is also a way for me to start to organize things and think about this
so let me just describe a few of what i think are relevant features from that experience and how
todays circumstances are either similar or different
if you compare our circumstances today with what we were confronting back in 1991 on
the positive side inflation and inflation expectations are both lower today  the unemployment
rate is lower than it was going into that recession  nominal and real interest rates appear to be
lower today than they were back then  i think that nonfinancial business balance sheets are in
better shape today on average than they were going into the 199091 experience and depository
institutions overall are in better shape today than they were back then although of course they
are having some very high profile problems  of course that was the period when we saw more
or less the virtual demise of the thrift industry and problems of major banks  there was also a
significant correction in housing activity which commenced in 1987 and ran through into 1990
it wasnt as sharp as the one we are experiencing but it was significant nevertheless  there was
also a credit crunch back then and that was given a lot of responsibility not only for the
recession but for its aftermaththat is the relatively sluggish recovery that occurred once the
recession endedbecause it was alleged that financial institutions nonfinancial businesses and
households were all trying to strengthen their balance sheets simultaneously and so there was a
good deal of caution throughout the financial sector  so there are a number of similarities as
well as a number of differences
when i think about todays circumstances a couple of things come to mind  one is as
president yellen summarized that the breadth of negative news about the economy is striking to
me  on top of that i think todays financial problems are without question more severe and
more intense than they were back then  they have engulfed many financial markets as we are
well aware  while there were declines in housing prices and housing values in some markets
back then the decline we are experiencing today is both more widespread and is likely before it
is done to be a good deal deeper  so i think that at least a reasonable parallel is the kind of thing
we experienced back in 199091
now on the inflation side let me start with policy  we werent targeting the federal
funds rate back then  we were still wedded to the monetary aggregates more or less  but the
funds rate nevertheless provides some useful information  the funds rate in early 1989 was
around 9 percent  it got to 3 percent by september 1992 where it stayed until early 1994  i
cite that because inflation whether you look at core or at headline actually diminished through
that period  so while some people have been worried and perhaps justifiably that this is going
to shape up like the late 1960s or much of the 1970s as far as inflation is concerned all i would
say about that is it is not a foregone conclusion if you look at history  i dont know that it is easy
to distinguish how this is likely to play out but that was a very significant series of policy moves
undertaken back then and inflation nevertheless diminished
the only other comment i would add to thisand it is not going to lift the gloom right
away certainlyis that these financial problems are going to persist  even if they bottom out
and conditions start to improve i would expect that they will exert headwinds on the shape of the
recovery  my view is that 2009 is not likely to be as healthy as the greenbook envisions largely
as a consequence of the hangover of financial problems  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  reports from my directors and business
contacts are consistent with what others have said this morningthat overall economic growth
has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the year  pessimism about the nearterm outlook
has increased  at the same time many are troubled by the continued elevation of prices and
price level increases and are apparently becoming less convinced that inflation will moderate any
time soon  in my view the deliberations this morning and the decision we make must be about
first financial system stabilitythe threat to the broad economy of severe financial instability
and second inflation risk and the role of rate policy in response to immediate problems  one
addition to the list of concerns is the continuing dollar depreciation since we met last and its role
in price pressures and overall uncertainty  in the runup to this meeting i heard little that casts
doubt on where the economy is trending  my assessment is that we have entered recession
territory  previous forecasts premised improvement in the second half on the stabilization of
house prices and financial markets  neither has materialized nor are there early encouraging
signs
in the current circumstances financial stability must be priority one  that said the
inflation picture has become quite troubling  headline inflation perhaps excluding last month
has been elevated since late summer as have measures of core inflation though less so  the
expected easing of pressures hasnt yet convincingly set in  a longer view leads to the
conclusion that inflation has been relatively high on average since 2005  we must be mindful
of this as we address financial stability concerns
i mentioned the dollars trajectory when i listed what in my view are the relevant
considerations today  i am concerned about what i perceive as growing mention of the
possibility of a dollar currency crisis  although only one conversation i also heard mention of a
developing dollar carry trade fueled by interest differentials expected rate cuts and possibly the
view that recessionary conditions will persist for some time
policy is often a balancing act but i see our current constraints as tightening  the real
side has entered recession in all probability  there is increasing risk to the inflation objective
financial stability is profoundly in play exacerbated by the trajectory of the dollar although to
be measured about this i think the current round of financial market problems has not yet thrown
the economy irreparably off balance
i intend to support a downward rate move today but with reservations about the utility of
continuing cuts in addressing financial stability problems  discussion in the policy round may
address this but i will comment now that balancing our policy objectives in such a riskladen
environment may require decoupling rate policy from liquidity measures  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  through my conversations with people in
the fourth district financial community i get the clear impression that some credit channels are
closing down  given the uncertainties in financial markets some of the large banks in my
district are finding it challenging to ascertain potential loss exposures in certain asset categories
especially to residential real estate developers  two large banks in the district have seen their
asset quality deteriorate more quickly than they had projected in january  clearly banks and
other financial institutions are getting squeezed from both sides of their balance sheets and the
most highly leveraged institutions are getting squeezed the hardest  many of the large banks in
my district are going to considerable lengths to stay liquid and to conserve capital  the largest
and most complex institutions are attempting to raise more capital
the deteriorating environment in the financial markets is clearly affecting business
conditions  most manufacturers in the district have seen a slowing in business activity  those
that are doing better are doing so because they are being helped some by stronger export
demand  pessimism over economic prospects is now prevalent among the ceos that i talked
with and many are scaling back their business plans for 2008 by a considerable amount  the
faltering business prospects are making the financial environment even more uncertaina
pattern that conforms to the adverse feedback loop that governor mishkin and others have been
warning about  like others i have once more cut my growth projections for 2008 and again by
a relatively large margin  as in the greenbook i have factored into my projection the weaker
than previously expected estimates of spending and employment as well as the sharp runup in
energy costs
an especially important element in my current thinking is the future path of housing
values  many of my contacts have told me that they dont see how financial market conditions
can stabilize without more confidence about where the bottom of the housing market lies and as
a corollary where the bottom of the residentialmortgagebacked security prices might lie
unfortunately i havent seen evidence that we are seeing a leveling out in housing prices  the
greenbook baseline projection carries with it nominal houseprice declines of about 5 percent
this year and next  a month ago that may have seemed like a reasonably good assumption to me
but today i fear that projection may be too optimistic  certainly the decline in house values that
one sees in futures markets for the markets that are covered by the caseshiller index indicates a
decline of twice that magnitude  my own baseline projection is closer to the greater housing
correction alternative than the greenbooks baseline projection  even the greater housing
correction with more financial fallout alternative seems somewhat plausible to me
turning to the inflation outlook at our january meeting my modal outlook was one in
which the inflation trend declined to just below 2 percent in 2010  at the same time i was one
of the few participants who said that the inflation risk had shifted to the upside  i still hold to
those viewsthat is i still expect the trend of inflation to fall below 2 percent by 2010 but i still
worry that we are going to continue to experience upside surprises to that inflation outlook
indeed i cant recall a single conversation that i have had with my business contacts recently
that hasnt touched on the increasing cost pressures that they are facing  in most cases they are
now successfully passing along price increases to their customers
nevertheless as i assess the economic environment this morning relative to where i was
in january particularly given the prospects of yet larger wealth losses stemming from the real
estate market and certainly the chance for even greater impairment to the functioning of our
credit markets i think the downside risks to economic growth continue to outweigh the upside
risks to inflation  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  clearly the incoming data on activity have been
weaker than we expected  i think they point to a downturn in gdp in the first half of the year
similar to that in the greenbook  while the february cpi report was welcome news on balance i
think the inflation picture continues to be troubling  i noticed a marked change in the sentiment of
my business contacts this round  many more are now telling me that the problems on wall street
are affecting their financing  credit availability is now an issue  with regard to borrowing from
banks these reports seem consistent with the senior loan officer opinion survey  credit is an
issue for those tapping nonbank sources as well as in the comments that president yellen made  as
an example back in december a major shopping center developer indicated that even though the
commercialmortgagebacked security market had dried up he was still able to obtain financing on
reasonable terms from other sources such as life insurance companies  last week he told me that
these sources had dried up too  hes now trying to raise equity funding which he considers very
costly and an unappealing alternative
many contacts also expressed increased nervousness over the economic situation and its
likely impact on demand for their products  manpowers ceo told me that their business had
deteriorated in recent weeks  some of his clients were trimming staff because of a lower current
demand and many others were being cautious and cutting back in expectation of future weakening
still even though restrictive financing and heightened caution are weighing on households and
businesses there is a sense from my contacts that spending is not collapsing at this point and
exports of capital equipment in the agricultural sector continue to do well similar to president
hoenigs comments
another common theme i heard from my contacts is that while the feds innovative
response has helped they do not expect that these measures will do a lot to solve the financial
sectors fundamental problems  i doubt that any of us disagree with that  as one of my directors
put it monetary policy is not enough  we need a solution to the subprime mess  once that
happens the contagion will run in reverse  i believe our innovative policies are helpful for
facilitating market functioning but they dont address the root problem  markets want a firmer
sense of where prices for stressed assets will bottom out and of the magnitude of the portfolio losses
that will be taken by major financial players  unfortunately it will take a good deal of time before
these uncertainties will be resolved and im not sure what we can do to speed the process  after all
a number of these losses are going to stem from mortgage delinquencies that have not yet occurred
and perhaps from homeowners who have not even contemplated that outcome  this means that
financial headwinds likely will be weighing on the real economy for some time as president stern
said  i agree with his comments there  the substantial uncertainty over the length and breadth of
this process adds uncertainty to the mediumterm outlook for growth  so while i am hopeful that
the economy will begin to recover in the second half of the year im a lot less confident of that
outcome than id like to be
turning to inflation fridays cpi report was about the only good news i heard during the
intermeeting period i think last time the reports werent very good either president yellen
although as the greenbook supplement points out the less favorable translation to pce prices takes
out some of the luster  its no surprise that many of my contacts pointed to increasing pressures
from higher costs for food energy and other commodity inputs  i also heard numerous reports of
higher costs being passed downstream  one notable case was for wallboard  even though demand
is weak and the industry had plenty of excess capacity higher costs for energy inputs were resulting
in the first increase in wallboard prices in 20 months  the director who reported this was concerned
that pricing behavior is moving toward a costplus mentality  this is after all his industry  if so
this would have negative implications for inflation expectations  however i see this as a risk and
not a base case scenario because the resource gaps opening up in the economy should bring inflation
down  firms will find it difficult to pass through cost increases in an environment of weak demand
businesses and financial market participants will be aware of this difficulty in passing through
costs which should help keep down their inflation expectations
that said even in a weak economy firms will have only so much room to absorb costs and
pressures from higher prices for energy and other commodities and for imported goods pose a risk
to the outlook  in addition while i expect inflation expectations to be contained there are risks on
this front too  some can see a low fed funds rate path such as that assumed by the greenbook as
an indication of a lack of resolve on inflation  i dont agree with that assessment but its an
increasing risk that we will be running particularly if the inflation news breaks in the wrong way
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  weve seen two striking macroeconomic
developments since our last meeting  we now have compelling evidence that a recession is in train
we now have compelling evidence of erosion in our inflation credibility  information from our
district corroborates a recession call  various survey indicators and reports from contacts point to
weakness in manufacturing commercial real estate and consumer spending  no signs have yet
emerged of a bottom in housing  the national reports on employment and retail sales for february
have sealed the case for recession  it now appears that payroll employment peaked at the end of 07
along with real income and household spending and to make matters worse anecdotal reports
suggest that the january fall in nonresidential construction is only the beginning of a sustained
deterioration  im now expecting a period of declining employment declining nonresidential
construction and flattosluggish consumption  equipment and software spending may decline as
well  past contractions suggest a trough later this year  more severe scenarios seem unlikely to me
however  the great depression for example involved us keeping real rates well above 5 percent
for several years as activity slowed and the price level declined 30 percent
it will take some time before the ultimate size of mortgage foreclosure losses is known well
enough to substantially reduce the uncertainty attached to mortgagebacked security returns and it
is not clear that interest rate changes will affect that timetable much  in the meantime i would
expect to see repeated bouts of financial turmoil  when particular markets or entities come under
stress i would also expect to see even wider speculation about and calls for new fed lending  its
even possible that fluctuations in the perceived prospects for such intervention add to financial
market volatility much the way conjectures about imf programs seemed to add to market volatility
in the 1990s
after a string of adverse inflation reports the cpi came in virtually flat for february  while
this certainly helps for many reasons including those mr stockton cited im not inclined to make
much of one months report  the overall cpi is still up over 4 percent year over year and given the
recent behavior of oil and gasoline prices inflation is likely to be high again in the march report  in
any event i think there is no comforting way to rationalize the substantial rise in the fiveyear five
yearahead inflation compensation weve seen since the beginning of the year  this measure of
inflation was previously ratcheted upward by similar amounts in early 1999 early 2001 mid2003
and early 2004  in each of these episodes our actions and statements communicated an increase in
our concern about growth prospects and market participants seem to have inferred a corresponding
reduction in our commitment to price stability  the net result over that period is that fiveyear five
yearahead inflation compensation has drifted up significantly over the past ten years from below
2 percent to now above 3 percent  this expectational drift is likely to overwhelm in my view any
transitory effect of increasing slack
i believe inflation expectations no longer qualify as well anchored  moreover they no
longer seem consistent with the credibility of even a 2 percent inflation objective  i believe that this
substantial erosion in our credibility is occurring because of our aggressive policy moves and the
perception that the hierarchy of our macroeconomic priorities has changed  it wouldnt surprise me
if our recent credit market interventions are bleeding over into a skepticism about our general
approach to timeconsistency problems  it cannot help to allow our credibility to drift around  i do
not think we want a regime in which longrun inflation expectations ratchet up whenever growth
slows significantly  ultimately we will be forced to act to restore credibility  this just adds
needless volatility to financial markets and the economy
i believe we need to adopt a strategy of easing much less aggressively going forward than
we have to date and than markets expect  president stern cited the 199091 recession and the fact
that both the federal funds rate and inflation came down during that recession  but surely the pace
of easing then had something to do with the fact that inflation came down  unless were willing to
let inflation expectations continue to drift we have to disappoint markets sometimes  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president sapenaro
mr sapenaro  thank you mr chairman  eighth district economic conditions have
softened but with considerable variability across industries and local areas  the outlook for district
agriculture is very strong in the context of high commodity prices  this prospect is reflected in
prices of agricultural land which in areas within the district have risen at a rate of 20 to 25 percent
over the past year in active markets  production of agricultural equipment for the 2008 crop season
is fully booked and prices of used equipment are at or very close to prices of new equipment
there was major activity in the district energy industry with significant construction projects of
coalfired generation facilities and rapidly developing exploration and production in the fayetteville
shale play in arkansas  total natural gas production from this source roughly quadrupled during
2007  in a recently published study it is estimated that the direct impact on arkansas output from
exploration and production will average about 25 billion per year for the next five years  for
perspective this is about 28 percent of the 2006 arkansas gross state product  overall activity in
the evansville indiana metropolitan area is particularly strong  the unemployment rate there has
declined year over year from 46 to 42 percent and nonfarm employment has grown 14 percent
from january 07 to january 08  a major investment in the auto parts industry is in the works for
this area
activity in housing markets in the district is soft with building permits in the four largest
metro areas down on average 168 percent during 2007  nevertheless house prices in the district
have held up much better than the national experience  in 21 district metropolitan areas house
prices increased an average of 25 percent in 2007 with decreases in house prices reported in only 3
metro areas  however in contrast to other parts of the nation these areas did not experience major
houseprice inflation before 2007  from 2000q4 through 2006q4 the average annual price
inflation in these areas was only 53 percent  foreclosures have increased in 2007 in three of the
four largest district metro areas but at much lower rates than nationally and 2007 foreclosure rates
are at or below national averages in three of these four areas
i solicited information on the national economy from a number of sources  contacts in the
air and ground cargo industry report significant cost pressures from higher energy prices  these
affect everything from fuel costs to the cost of snow removal  respondents indicate that these cost
increases are significantly but not completely passed through to their prices  international cargo
traffic is reported to show strong growth but with some customers substituting sea for air shipment
and choosing less rapid delivery service to reduce cost  yearoveryear traffic out of asia to both
europe and north america has grown at doubledigit rates  one contact indicated that volume
appears to have bottomed out in the first half of 2007 and has slowly but steadily improved since
in contrast a contact in the overtheroad trucking industry reported that there was not much change
in the past two months  in his view the industry has been in recession since december 2006  he
sees improvement for his firm going forward not because of increased demand but because of small
competitors exiting the industry through bankruptcy  excluding fuel surcharges freight prices are
flat to down
a contact at a major credit card bank reported that their credit card activity indicates that
retail sales excluding autos were flat in february and are likely to be flat to down in march  these
february data were confirmed by the advance retail sales report last week  he also reported that a
smaller percentage of customers are making full payment on their credit cards and that a larger
percentage are making only the minimum required payment  he sees delinquencies spreading to
credit cards  a contact at a major software producer indicates that revenue growth was robust prior
to the first quarter of 2008 and while remaining strong has slackened since the beginning of the
year  he reports strong retail sales but that was possibly influenced by reductions in prices  he
sees business it spending in the united states remaining strong and no deterioration in the
collection of receivables  nevertheless he is less optimistic about the industry outlook now than in
january  finally a contact in the quick service restaurant industry or fast food sees business as
stable at the moment not getting worse but not getting better  he notes that while historically this
industry is affected least when the economy slows down this particular time he sees gasoline prices
as a significant factor with many consumers making fewer trips to purchase lowticket items  he
also views financial markets as closed to all but the largest and most highly rated nonfinancial
corporations  in his words there is no market for deals
the national economy certainly appears headed for a weaker first half of 2008 than seemed
likely at the january meeting  a model estimated by our staff economists for forecasting recessions
suggests a probability in the neighborhood of 60 percent that the nber dating committee will label
the current experience an official recession  unlike some i am not an optimist on the effect of the
fiscal stimulus program on consumer demand  economic theory and past experience with such one
off stimulus programs do not provide a basis for assuming a strong response  in the current
situation with many consumers heavily leveraged it is likely that the stimulus to consumption will
be less than historical averages
notwithstanding the february cpi report the inflation situation is deteriorating and appears
likely to continue deteriorating  beyond the immediate issue of containing systemic risk the most
important issue is the subsequent economic recovery  we have eased aggressively already  we
must not lose focus on the lagged effect of current policy actions on that recovery  we must
preserve the credibility of our commitment to low and stable inflation  the greatest danger is a
relapse into a period of higher inflation which then promotes a policy response that could generate
a future recession and start a vicious cycle of increasing inflation and increasing unemployment
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as anticipated third district business activity
showed continued weakness in february and march  reports from retailers manufacturers
bankers and other business contacts remain somewhat downbeat  at the same time there has been
little moderation in price pressures facing our firms and consumers  there is little new in the
regional housing markets  so rather than dwell on housing let me talk about some of the
information that we have received since our last meeting
banks in the third district have generally been relatively unscathed by the toll on the
financial markets  many had not been in the subprime market and did not have instruments based
on subprime  they do however hold a high proportion of commercial real estate and residential
mortgage loans in their portfolios  so to the extent that the commercial real estate market slows as
we expect our banks are likely to be feeling the effects  bankers thus have become somewhat
more pessimistic over the past six weeks or so  they dont expect financial conditions to improve
any time soon and several noted signs of declining business loan demand which they had not been
seeing earlier  bankers also report some deterioration in personalloan credit quality and are
expecting increases in credit card delinquencies  despite these increases these delinquencies and
default rates so far remain well within historical norms
manufacturing outlook activity in the district remains weak  our march business outlook
survey is confidential until we release it this coming thursday  it will show a little improvement in
februarys dismal readings  since the beginning of the year the general activity index has been at a
level typically associated with either a national recession or a substantial slowdown in economic
growth  so despite the modest improvement it doesnt move us out of negative territory
responses to a special survey question in february indicate that the majority of our firms considers
their inventories to be at an appropriate level and firms are unlikely to substantially replenish these
inventories until midyear or later  but it doesnt seem as though there will be moredramatic
reductions in inventoriesas for example in the greenbooks basic story where theres a very
large inventory correction it appears
despite the weakness in activity there has been little moderation in price pressures in the
district  the current pricespaid index in our business outlook survey continues to accelerate and
both the pricespaid and pricesreceived indexes over the past three months are at very high levels
relative to the last twenty years  firms in various sectors not just manufacturing were reporting
significant increases in prices particularly of imported inputs  although our firms are expecting
continued weak real activity they expect prices to rise over the next six months  indeed the
forwardlooking price indexes in the survey are at very elevated levels and the futurepricespaid
index is at its highest level since the early 1980s  our firms seem to be as skeptical as i am of the
arguments of the critical link between inflation and resource utilization
turning to the national outlook i struggled coming into this meeting with a growing level of
discomfort  there are four dimensions to my concerns  first the outlook for growth second the
outlook for inflation third the calibration of monetary policy given that outlook and fourth the
turmoil in the financial markets  first in terms of nearterm economic growth the outlook has
deteriorated somewhat since our last meeting  i expected weak growth in the first half of the year
but the incoming data suggest that growth will probably be somewhat weaker than i anticipated  i
and many privatesector forecasters like the ma or the blue chip survey summaries have
responded to the incoming data with downward revisions to our forecast for certainly the first half
of 2008  but our changes are considerably smaller than the revisions in the greenbooks forecast
which have revised down personal consumption in 2008 from 23 percent in the january forecast to
zero in the current forecast while incorporating significantly more monetary policy stimulus  i
realize that the boards staff has a good track record but i am not wholly comfortable with the
greenbooks forecast which i think incorporates a number of judgmental adjustments that are
responsible for taking it pretty far away from where privatesector forecasts now are
second im just less comfortable with the inflation outlook  ive said before that if
inflation expectations become unhinged we will face an even more difficult problem as monetary
policy will feed more quickly and directly into higher inflation outcomes  the ensuing loss of
credibility will be costly to regain  i wish we had the luxury of waiting for unambiguous evidence
that expectations have lost their anchor  but if we wait until then it will be too late  this means
that we have to look for early warning signs so we can take appropriate action to ensure that
expectations remain anchored and i am concerned that we are seeing those warning signs  despite
last fridays cpi numbers headline and core inflation have been trending up  oil prices are at
record highs  commodity prices continue to trend up and the dollar has fallen sharply
our business and consumer contacts are consistently stressing price pressures as a concern
these developments concern me partly because research indicates that inflation actually may have
become less persistent since the 1990s and i think we have to be careful not to interpret the lack of
persistence independent of what monetary policy actions are taken  moreover inflation
expectations measured by surveys and marketbased measures have all risen over the last couple of
months  inflation risk premiums have risen which could be an early warning signal of a waning
credibility or commitment on the part of the fed  the national association for business economics
survey in early march shows that a third of the respondents think that monetary policy is now too
stimulative and that is up from less than 10 percent just a few months ago
according to a special question on our november survey of professional forecastersi
reported on this several meetings agohalf of those forecasters 23 out of the 45 believe that the
fomc has an inflation target  of those 23 forecasters 20 believe that longrun inflation over the
next ten years will be 50 basis points or more above what they view our inflation target is  i might
be able to shrug off one or two of these but the predominance of these signals has me concerned
about the risk to our credibility  im also concerned that the public seems to perceive that the fed
has effectively set aside one part of its mandate price stability in our allout efforts to promote
economic growth  said differently it seems to suggest that not only are we incorporating new data
into our loss function as our forecasts change but we are changing the coefficients on that loss
function  i dont believe that we are necessarily doing that and i dont believe thats the right way
to make policy but i do believe that ultimately its up to us to make that clear to the public as best
we can
third we have to calibrate the appropriate level of the funds rate and not just its rate of
change  this is not an easy task especially in the current circumstances  we have reduced the
targeted funds rate by 225 basis points since august and 125 basis points in just the last six weeks
it is simply too soon for the economy to have felt the full effects of these rate cuts  while the recent
deterioration in the outlook might suggest that we need easier policy i believe that the recent
increases in inflation expectations mean that the real funds rate has already fallen either below zero
or close to zero depending on how we measure it  for example the real funds rate is now minus 1
percent which is below the more pessimistic greenbookconsistent r of minus 05 percent given in
the bluebook if you measure the real rate as the nominal funds rate minus the greenbooks one
quarterahead forecasted headline pce  the greenbook suggests that the real funds rate can be
negative over the next two years and inflation will continue to decelerate as upside inflation
pressure is offset by greater slack in product and labor markets  i am skeptical  this outcome is
predicated on inflation expectations remaining well anchored despite aggressive and persistent
easing for a sustained period of time  given the current fragility of inflation expectations this
seems very unlikely to me  the alternative greenbook scenario with more inflation pressure from
oil and imported goods suggests a steeper policy path and higher inflation by 201012
fourth and finally like everyone else i am very concerned about the developments in the
financial markets  ive been supportive of the steps weve taken to enhance liquidity in the markets
through the taf the tslf the pdcf or whatever
chairman bernanke  aeiou
vice chairman geithner  dont say iou  laughter
mr plosser  well ive been supportive of those and i want to compliment the new
york desk and the people who have worked on this because i think they are very innovative  im
not clear how successful these instruments will be and they are not without their own set of risks of
creating some potentially dangerous expectations regarding future fed behavior which eventually
we must deal with  but i think they are worth trying as long as they are removed in due course  i
can also support a further narrowing of the spread between the funds rate and the primary credit
rate although i would eventually like to see a review of what we think that spread ought to be in
more normal times and what our exit strategy might be like as we move toward that  giving some
thought down the road to that i think would be helpful
so while i believe that we have appropriately reduced the funds rate in response to the
worsening economic outlook for the real economy i am less convinced that reducing the funds rate
further will do much to stem the liquidity problems in the market or to lower risk premiums
uncertainty about valuations seems to be the root cause of liquidity problems  the price discovery
process needs to continue and it may take a while  in this case i think the fed needs to continue to
do its job to reassure markets that it will act as an appropriate lender of last resort but we must be
careful that a lower funds rate if that is the path we take doesnt become just a form of forbearance
that contributes to delaying the necessary writedowns and the price discovery process itself  yes
the financial markets can have spillovers to the real economy to which the fed needs to react with
monetary policy and i believe we have  at the same time we need to keep focused on both parts of
our mandate  we put our credibility at risk if we do not do so and this would be a cause for severe
problems later when we may need to act to regain it  we will have to face the fact at some point
that we will disappoint the markets with their everincreasing forecast of a lower funds rate  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  its 1035  why dont we take twenty
minutes for coffee  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we reconvene  lets start with president
fisher
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  mr chairman today is my 59th birthday and
i cant think of a better group of people to spend it withor a less happy time to do it
mr kroszner  we sure know how to take the punch bowl away from this party
laughter
mr fisher  well listen i know we are suffering because our deputy secretary here
sitting to your right mr chairman just gave me a candle and had me blow it out with no cake
attached  laughter  i want to use very quickly just four examples of what i think is going on
with the economy  the first is that 21 miles of boxcars that are 89 feet in measurement each and
usually carry lumber are laid up on railroads  the second is that theres a labor shortage in the
yangtze river basin according to one of my interlocutors  the third is that exxon is rolling 39
billion in cash in overnight deposits  the fourth is just to keep you listening that i am going to
come back to my ninth birthday in conclusion
as to the 21 miles of boxcars the average length of a flatbed car that carries lumber is
89 feet  burlington northern has 21 miles of it laid up  i mention that because according to my
contacts at the happy housing group that i talk to that builds a significant portion of homes in this
country this housing setback as they put it is worse than 75 81 and 91 combined  i have
been a bear on housing from the first time i came to this table and i agree with everything that
has been said about the downside pressure that is being exerted by housing  i would add a
couple of points just to underscore that  one is the 21 miles of flatbed cars that are laid end to
end  the other is a concern i have from my interlocutors at ups in that the past six weeks they
have seen a downturn in their volume of 2 percent  the ceo describes that as a very unusual
swing from an up 3 percent in january and something that he has not seen before and i want to
remind you that he was a cfo for many years  the third point is on the growth side something
that perhaps we can monitor going forward  walmart now polls one million customers  they
started doing so last april  there are some imperfections in their polling  they find that 67
percent are concerned about the economic situation particularly about their financial matters
driven largely by perceptions of their decreasing wealth in their homes but also more
importantly by costofliving factors such as gas prices and the cost of money
with regard to the comment on china at a conference in paris recently governor kohn
presidents evans and yellen and i had the pleasure of listening to mr yi who is the deputy
governor of the peoples bank of china  he made the comment that there is a shortage of labor
in the yangtze river basin which i found quite startling  i followed up with him on that
conversation more in depth and because of that i am not surprised to hear about the inflationary
forces that were spoken about at this table  it goes beyond energy mr chairman and it goes
beyond food although i want to make some comments on food  i talked to several food
producers and they are all intending to pass through price increases of somewhere between
5 and 15 percent  most distressing to me was anheuserbusch since i am a beer lover  the cost
of input of hops and barley has gone up 3 percent  when you add aluminum transportation
charges and other things it totals almost 15 percent and they expect at the retail level for the
price of beer to be passed through at about 57 percent  so say 5 to 6 percent  combine that
with the largest producer of pizza crusts who is expecting a 20 percent increase in the price
sought for their product then you get a sense of a broader issue at hand on food  let me
summarize that broader issue  i want to come back to walmart  they sell 10000 food items
they expect an average price increase across those 10000 items that they are budgeting for this
year of a little over 5 percent  according to a senior official we will be aggressive about
pricing  we are lagging in terms of our price increases as price leader and now we are working
aggressively to catch up  that leads to concern on my part  i am well aware of the fact that we
have not seen increasing demands from labor but i dont consider labor to be a domestic
phenomenon  i consider it to be a global phenomenon and i am concerned that you are hearing
such reports in areas where our producers have offlaid certain manufacturing processes and
sourcing of inventory including in china  i therefore would suggest that they bear watching
with regard to the comment about exxons rolling cash to me this gets to the heart of the
issue and that is that i dont believe as mr evans said that monetary policy is addressing the
root problem  the root problem is a problem of liquidity solvency and trust  when you have a
sophisticated operation like that rolling cash in overnight bank deposits it raises significant
alarms to me because it indicates a lack of trust in the system through which you might otherwise
conduct your cash and liquidity operations  i liken the situation mr chairman to the
followingand forgive my simplicity  ill use a hydraulic rather than a medical example which
i am often wont to do  we are the water main and yet the grass is turning brown  the water is
not getting to the grass because the piping is clogged with all the hair and residue and all of the
ugly stuff that has been building up in this rube goldberg piping device that we allowed to
happen over a long period of time  i dont believe that cutting the fed funds rate addresses the
issue  i do believe that the measures we have undertaken recently to enhance liquidity to
improve the functioning of the system and to address the solvency issues are of significant
import  earlier you mentioned the duke survey of cfos  seventyfive percent of those cfos
said fed funds rate cuts were not helping their business operations  i would have expected
otherwise  after the last meeting praying against my own vote i hoped that everything that we
had hoped would go up would go up and everything we had hoped would go down would go
downspreads et cetera  yet if you look to the chart bookthe bluebook for example or the
presentation earlier this morningalmost every single graph of what we had hoped would go
down went up and vice versa and i think that indicates that there are limits to the efficacy of
cutting the fed funds rate
i said i would conclude with my ninth birthday  when i was nine years old threemonth
treasury bills were trading where they are today  thank you mr chairman
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i ask one clarifying question
chairman bernanke  certainly
vice chairman geithner  president fisher did you just say the efficacy of any
cut in the fed funds rate
mr fisher  i believe that the efficacy of the cuts that we have undertaken has been
diminished by virtue of the liquiditysolvency crisis
vice chairman geithner  i completely agree with that  but just to make sure
that i didnt misinterpret you did you say the efficacy of any further cut
mr fisher  i think it is pretty clear that i am not going to vote for further cuts
vice chairman geithner  no further cuts
mr fisher  at this juncture  look tim we cut rates 50 basis points last time  i was
in a minority of one and i respect the group around this table more than i respect myself  here
is the point  everything that we wanted to go down went up and everything that we wanted to
go up went down  so i just wonder about the efficacy of the cuts as opposed to the measures that
we have undertaken
vice chairman geithner  i wasnt debating  it was just a clarifying question
chairman bernanke  okay  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i agree with the others around the table who
have said that the prospects for economic activity have taken another sizable leg down over the
intermeeting period  i think we have been for a time in that adverse feedback loop between
financial markets and spending that everybodygovernor mishkin and othershas been talking
about  that is not an unusual kind of loop to be in during a soft economic period  i think it is
probably characteristic of a lot of slow growth and recessionary periods  but certainly it has
been more intense this time because the financial turmoil has spread well beyond housing and
has intensified significantly over the intermeeting period
the incoming data on spending employment and production were weaker than expected
house prices are moving lower by more than we or the markets expected  all of these data have
accentuated concerns about the creditworthiness of households and businesses and hence about
the creditworthiness of the people who lend to them especially those who lend in the mortgage
market  as perceptions of risk and risk aversion rose there was a flight to safety and liquidity  i
think we see that a little in the growth of m2 over the past couple of months which has been
very very strong and suggests that households are retreating to money market funds probably
the ones that hold government securities and to insured deposits  in wholesale markets there has
been unwillingness to take positions and rising concerns about an array of intermediaries  bill
described this process much better than i couldilliquid markets extreme volatility
deleveraging margin calls forced sales especially in mortgagebacked securities wider spreads
equity prices falling and lending and funding tenors collapsing toward the overnight again  so
financial conditions have tightened for everybody but the governmentand some of the
european governments have seen them tighten i guess  mortgage rates have risen and business
bond yields have risen as well even with treasury rates going down  tighter credit and
declining equity and house prices are reducing wealth and all of this weakens spending further
now to this process the staff has judged that the economy has entered a recessionary
state in which we can expect household and business spending to fall short of normal levels
given income and interest rates  i am not sure how much weight to put on this  i am a bit
uncomfortable with constructs that dont have a clear story behind them  but i must say that
looking at the sentiment indicators and listening to what i have heard around the table today from
almost every federal reserve district reporting i now put more credence in daves recessionary
state than i did before the meeting started  obviously something is going on that is undermining
confidence and making people much more cautious than you would think given the exogenous
variables  i do think talking about the recessionary state underlines the extraordinary uncertainty
we are dealing with  president stern pointed out the 199091 precedent  there are some
precedents for some aspects of this but we dont have many and i think it is really difficult to
know how financial markets will evolve and how that will feed through to the variables that
affect household and business spendingthe reaction of households businesses and state and
local governments to tighter credit conditions
i agree with president stern president evans and others who said they thought that the
financial stresses are deeper and will last longer than we thought and will therefore put more
restraint on spending  until markets stabilize on a sustained basis the risk to satisfactory
economic performance by the us economy will remain skewed very much to the downside
now federal reserve liquidity tools that we have used are necessary to reduce the odds on even
moreintense downwardspiral crises and market liquidity feeding back onto spending  so i
think our innovations here have been useful to reduce the downside risks a little and thereby to
promote spending  but i agree with the others who say that they dont directly deal with the
underlying macro risk which is really a story about capital solvency wealth and prices
i think monetary policy easing is a necessary aspect of addressing these macroeconomic
risks  i agree with president fisher president plosser and others that there is more going on and
that monetary policy easing may not be a sufficient way of addressing these risks  but i do
think as long as the economy is weakening the way it is and we have these risks that easing
monetary policy will be helpful  it will help bolster asset prices  it will make the cost of capital
lower than it otherwise would be  it may not be sufficient to turn the thing around but i do think
that without the easing that we have done and that i hope that we do todaythe situation
would be far worse than it otherwise would be  we need to ease to compensate for the
substantial headwinds that we are facing
now the forecast for inflation has not been marked down despite the greater output gap
as others have remarked this output gap is offset to a considerable extent by the upward
pressure on prices from oil and commodities and import prices as the dollar has fallen and prices
have risen in our exporting partnerschina for example  i have to confess that i dont really
understand what has been happening to commodity prices in recent months  i dont think the
rise has been justified by the news on the underlying conditions of supply and demand  it is
much larger than the dollar weakness has been and the dollarcommodity price has always been
a weak relationship  so in fact commodity prices are rising in a bunch of currencies  this isnt
just a dollar weakness problem  i have to believe that there is a speculative element here  partly
as a consequence i am comfortable with the forecast of a flattening commodity price picture in
the futureit might even decline but at least a flattening out
i do think a shift from financial assets especially dollar assets into commodities is going
on and mostly this has been triggered by concerns about the us economy and financial
markets  in some sense that shift is okay  it is driving down the dollar and that is helping to
stabilize the economy  the decline that we saw in oil prices yesterday suggests that when
people get more confidence about where those financial markets are going some of those
commodity prices will actually fall as the concerns about the us economy are alleviated  it is
sort of an upsidedown relationship but i do think we saw a bit of it that way  but i also sense
that some of the rise in commodity prices and the fall in the dollar reflects concerns about the
inflation outlook here  it is not surprising to me in a very volatile and uncertain environment
that inflation expectations are not as well anchored and that they fluctuate a lot in response to
new information  i expect that inflation will come down as commodity prices level off then the
output gap will increase and that in turn will keep inflation expectations down  still navigating
this appreciably weaker economic outlook for the real economy and the threats to financial
stability on the one hand and the tenderness of inflation expectations on the other will require
some discussion in the next section of our meeting mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  to join the growing chorus in the discussion
today i would say that there are very significant policy challenges across five areas on both sides
of our mandate  first the real economy is materially weaker  second inflation risks are quite
discomforting  third we have genuine issues with respect to financial stability  fourth we
have very real problems with respect to the credit channel and credit availability  finally as i
think a couple of others have said we have risks in terms of possible disorderly moves on the
dollar  in terms of what markets believe that we believe are the big concerns i think they rightly
understand that we are very worried about downside risks to the economy  they believe that we
are very focused on financial stability risks and with the three new facilities announced in recent
periods they are coming to believe that we are finding an effective means to deal with a credit
intermediation system that is to perhaps overstate only a little broken  but market participants
may not yet believe that we are as concerned as we ought to be about inflation risks and about
risks with respect to the path of the exchange value of the dollar
with that summary having been made let me talk first about financial market
conditions   about the deterioration in market functioning since the last fomc meeting bill
spoke in great detail  over the past couple of weeks not just in the episode with bear stearns
counterparty risk has become the dominant concern in markets  as has been pointed out around
this table it is increasingly difficult to separate liquidity issues from solvency issues  so what
should we take from this deterioration in counterparty risks  if we look at a range of financial
institutions that have different degrees of implied backstops by the government based on their
size and their regulatory structure we think about the gses that have an implied government
guarantee and even ginnie maes which have the full faith and credit backing of the us
government and about which the board staff shared some data yesterday with us  the spreads
on all of these look as though they have widened substantially  we have seen very real
deterioration  but when you see that it is happening for the ginnie maes just as with many of
these other securities it suggests that this is substantially but not completely about liquidity risk
because the credit risk of ginnies ostensibly cant be called into question
financial institutions more broadly than financial markets are having a hard time finding
their way  we have talked around this table before about their balance sheet problems and most
recently we have talked about their income statement problems in figuring out what their core
business is  in the markets in the last couple of days we have had the brokerdealers with
widening cds spreads and falling share prices and of course that is about their mortgage
exposure and liquidity concerns  but i think most fundamentally that the business model of
investment banks has been threatened and i suspect the existing business model will not endure
through this period  as a result the current architecture of the regulation of financial institutions
and of the business model across ranges of financial institutionscommercial banks investment
banks and hedge fundswill change through this period  the old model at least in investment
banking of high imputed leverage works incredibly well in a world of high liquidity and doesnt
work as well when liquidity is in short supply
why do i think this matters  it matters because it suggests that any catalyst for
improvement from financial institutions feeding into the real economy for the rest of 2008 or
even for the first half of 2009 is quite suspect  these institutions are spending all their time and
attention on their own business models figuring out how they can survive this period not on
providing credit to the real economy  so i dont look to financial institutions to be very good
shock absorbers or very good catalysts going forward  my concern broadly about financial
institutions is highlighted when i think about the need across all these institutions to raise
significant capital for safety and soundness purposes and in addition for credit availability
purposes  it strikes me that this broad class is systematically undercapitalized and we need to
use all our tools to persuade them that it is in their interest and in the interest of the broad
economy for them to raise capital
but finding capital certainly over the next six months will be a very real challenge  the
capital markets are not in a very strong position to satisfy issuer needs at present  that obviously
can improve over the next couple of months but there is no certainty  sovereign wealth funds
and other sources of investment that we have been talking about for some timeand we saw
their real interest in investing in financial institutions at the end of last year or early this year
are quite beaten down  those that i talked to who are very sophisticated investors from places
in asia and the middle east do not want to appear as though they are doormats for these
financial institutions  their own political structures make the losses they have had to endure
front page news  i think the expectation that sovereign wealth funds are going to continue to be
a source of funding in this period is well overstated  moreover private equitythe case for
opportunistic capitalhas little ability to get leverage in this environment and so if they dont
reduce their target hurdle rates i dont expect them to be able to come to the rescue  all of that
again suggests to me that the real economy will have to wait awhile for improvement as this
repair is slow and not at all certain over the next six to nine months
obviously the implication for the real economy is hard to speculate about but i think
looking at some rough measures maybe a third of the credit availability of the real economy has
been taken out during this periodmaybe more than that  i would say that the last week makes
it hard for us to judge how much more credit channel capability and balance sheet capacity have
left the real economy but it suggests a picture for the real economy that is worthy of real
concern  now when i look to the real economy i would just underscore the comments i have
heard from others  a couple of ceos who have been incredibly optimistic at least in my
discussions with them in the past couple of yearsthese are ceos of leading consumer product
companieshave thrown in the towel  they have given up trying to justify and explain away
weakness  across the auto sector a couple of the new owners of the auto companies are now
focused on a scenario in which units are in the 145 million range rather than the 15 million or
155 million range largely because of weakness of consumption in terms of consumer purchases
but that really goes back to credit and in some ways the credit availability to fund those auto
purchases is a chance for another stepdown in the next month
i think that business capex is as threatened as has been represented today  it is the only
area for which my own sense is probably more negative than the greenbooks in terms of
weakness to expect out of europe and the united kingdom  it is hard for me to think as we go
through this period that europe and the united kingdom would stay as decoupled as recent data
suggest  their economies are tied to their banking system more concretely than we are tied to
ours and i suspect that their large financial institutions are going to suffer real problems during
this upcoming period  if not it is certainly a risk factor
let me turn to the last two issuesinflation and currency  on the inflation front there is
little reason to be confident that inflation will decline  there are reasons to believe that our
inflation problems will become more pronounced and i fear more persistent  the recent runup
in energy prices and commodity prices in the context of weaker global demand is troubling  no
doubt partly it is a move to real assets by the financial communitythat is a hedge against all of
this is certainly to the governor kohns point raising commodity prices  but i am not sure what
catalyst will change that over at least the next six months  as the board staff has noted there
has been some rise in inflation compensation and inflation expectations  there is acceleration in
the fall of the exchange rate of the dollar suggestive of increasing import inflation  moreover it
is not obvious to me that a slowing economy in this cycle in the short term at least will do our
work for us on the inflation front
finally let me turn to currency  given this particular confluence of events the
accelerated depreciation of the dollar is troubling and i think the risks of a disorderly move on
the dollar in the upcoming six weeks are hard to discount  the catalyst of that could be a sudden
depegging by certain countries in the middle east  but even if that does not come to pass there
is an expectation in the market where traders are looking for bets where they believe they can
make money with certitude that there is still a free oneway bet on the dollar  that is not
healthy for currency movements regardless of ones view of where the dollar should ultimately
be trading against the currencies of our trading partners  at this time particularly given our
concerns about making sure that the us economy remains open for foreign direct investment
that this is where others want to invest their capitalit strikes me as a reasonably dangerous
prospect if the view is that the dollar will continue its accelerated path  obviously this suggests
very difficult judgments for the next round of our discussion and i will take up monetary policy
in that context  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks  ive talked many times before about the slow burn from the
financial markets that is spreading out elsewhere  unfortunately i think the fire is a bit hotter than i
had expected in my earlier discussions and it comes particularly through capital pressures in the
financial institutions  what were seeing now is the simultaneity of stress in the housing market and
stress in the financial markets and they will be cured together  i think they are joined at the hip
whether we have tools to address those directly is something we continue to discuss but i think it is
this direct connection that potentially leads to the negative feedback loop that we have discussed
quite a bit  for housing of course there are the direct negative wealth effects but also the lingering
uncertainty of whats going to happen as many people have mentioned  part of this comes from
just a change in behavior  people are acting very differently during this housing cycle from in the
past so it is very difficult to predict the evolution of foreclosures even given a particular
macroeconomic outcome  theres still the uncertainty of the macroeconomic outcome but people
are going delinquent much earlierthey are going delinquent on their houses before they go
delinquent on their credit cardsand so it is really a different model of consumer behavior which
makes valuing the securities particularly problematic  this is of course in addition to uncharted
territory in terms of real and nominal price declines  well see exactly how people will respond to
these things  obviously the markets are closed and the banks have to keep these on their books
with higher cost and more difficulty financing  some of the changes that came in with the stimulus
package to raise the conforming limits for freddie mac and fannie mae have done little to bring
down the spreads because they have significantly increased the cost of the guarantees given this new
environment  its not unreasonable to do that but the potential benefit from the changes is lower
than we might otherwise have hoped for
this is all having consequences for credit cards  even though at first it was the mortgages
now were starting to see a significant uptick in delinquencies on credit cards and spending and a
number of peoplepresident rosengren president yellen and first vice president sapenaro
have mentioned some of these things  i just want to report a bit from my conversations with some
of the major credit card companies which have kind of a window into realtime consumer spending
they are seeing a continuing flattening but not a falloff of growth  theres no collapse but certainly
a continued downtrend as ive been reporting over the past few monthsa continuing slowing of
payments and a continuing increase in delinquencies  their socalled roll rates of people moving
from 30 days behind to 60 days behind to 90 days behind continue to go up  they are still going up
although not significantly  they are concerned about that but it is not spiking up  they are mainly
concerned about when the roll rate gets into 90 to 180 days  theyre not getting their money back
personal bankruptcies are going up  the cure rates are much lower and the recovery rates are much
lower  so there seems to be a group of people who are getting into extreme financial difficulty  all
the series that ive quoted are general averages  the contacts said that in areas of particular housing
stress basically all of the numbers are three times as high  it is significantly more stressful there
showing a very clear link between stress in the housing market and these other stresses
have they been responding  well because of very strong pressures that may be coming
directly from us and certainly from capitol hill the credit card companies dont respond by
changing interest rates  they respond by reducing the amount of credit available and thats exactly
what theyve been doing  so theyve been cutting credit lines of a lot of people  also as i think
president yellen or a number of people mentioned theyre also cutting back on the helocs
because they have been concerned that people are taking money out when no equity is there and so
they really want to pull back on that  these overall tightening credit conditions are reflecting the
continued stress on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions more generally as you see
with the bear stearns example its not just the depository institutions but a broader set of
institutions that are creating pressures both on the asset side and on the funding side  we have had a
lot of the sivs and a lot of the other assets coming on board  unplanned asset expansions may
continue particularly if the economy does go down  what now seem to be very good credits in the
leveraged lending market may no longer be good credits  so the anecdotal evidence that youve
been mentioning around the table could turn into further unplanned asset expansions if these things
start to go south
consumer writeoffs obviously are another thing that is putting on funding pressure  also
as i think president evans mentioned interestingly there have been few actual losses that have
occurred on many of these securities in terms of the inability to make the payments although the
losses in the value in the markets have been quite spectacular in some cases  some of this has to do
with the broad evaluation uncertainty  some of it has to do with liquidity  i think this is where we
have the direct link between liquidity and macro stability because the uncertainties in part are
coming from the macro uncertainty about how housing markets will evolve  obviously i have said
this before  there are other factors that come in but thats a big one
so doing something to provide some insurance against that or to help provide comfort that
these markets can come back is important because theres a very close link between liquidity issues
that we have been seeing the unwillingness to finance and the capital issues that have been coming
from an incompleteness of markets  the markets just arent there for people to be trading in  they
are valuing things off an index  the index cant be arbitraged against the underlying markets
because the underlying markets arent there  so the index is doing something else  its the only
somewhat liquid market thats providing some hedging  its driving that down and people dont
want to buy the underlying security because theyll have to take the mark against this index rather
than the true value  if they have to take the mark against something that they think is going to be
pushed down artificially theyre not going to buy the security in the first place  these kinds of
continuing stress make me feel a little less optimistic about the bounceback in 09 thats in the
greenbook although i dont think its ruled out
just turning quickly to inflation we have a bit of a paradox in what has gone on recently as
everyone has saidsignificantly slowing growth over the past four to five months but no evidence
of slowing in the pressure on commodity energy and agriculture prices  thats despite some
slowing elsewhere in the world and expectations of slower growth  the ppi numbers that came out
today raised some concerns that some of the good parts of the cpi will not be flowing through to
pce  also over the last year or two when weve had the unemployment rate below 5 percent or
4 percent whatever your favorite number is where there would be pressure on wages we havent
seen much pressure on wages  so im not sure that if the unemployment rate goes significantly
above 5 percent well see much on the other side that will take pressure off wages to bring things
down  so i do remain concerned there  but i think theres a final risk that if commodity energy
and agriculture prices do significantly move down it could have a major effect on some of the
emerging markets and some of our other trading partners  so theres a bit of a paradox here that if
there are some potential benefits of the slowdown to reduce these prices that could actually also
reduce export demand whichas a number of people pointed outis very important in the forecast
for keeping this a shallow recession  so i remain concerned on both the growth front and the
inflation front but i do think that macro stability is probably the primary thing that we need to be
thinking about right now  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  well im quite depressed  thats not my
usual personality trait but the reality is that weve had as bad a set of shocks as i could have
imagined and i want to talk about this set of shocks  we have been hit with things that are making
our policy environment as complicated as i possibly could have imagined  the reality is that we are
in the worst financial crisis that weve experienced in the postworld war ii era  i dont think we
should be shy about saying it  we are in a financial crisis and it is worse than we have experienced
in any other episode of financial disruption which is the word i use  i will not use financial
crisis in public  financial disruption is still a good phrase to use in public but i really do think
that this is a financial crisis  it is surely going to be called that in the next edition of my textbook
participant  when is it coming out
mr mishkin  wouldnt you like to know  i believe that actually the greenbook forecast
of a mild recession is reasonable but the possibility that we could have a severe recession is
uncomfortably high and i find the prospect pretty scary  the reality is that we are in this adverse
feedback loop that i and others talked about  i think were deep into it  the credit markets have
been deteriorating  thats led to a sharp weakening of the economys prospects  this is reflected in
the very large change in the greenbook forecast with which i do strongly concur so i dont think
that it was out of line to put those in  of course that weakening has been feeding back to
deteriorating financial conditions  so i think were really in a tough pickle and there are costs not
just in terms of the economy  one result is that weve just expanded the safety net to a much wider
set of institutions and we are in a brave new world here and it is very disturbing  so the
ramifications in terms of the economy weakening and the adverse feedback loop go beyond just the
fact that we might have unemployment  it may have major effects on the way markets work in the
future and that i think is something that we should be worried about and should be a consideration
as well  the bottom line on real activity for me is that the prospects are very poor and i find the
downside risk just plain scary  thats the first part of my depression
the second part of the depression is that its bad enough that we had these contractionary
aggregate demand shocks from the financial sector but we also have had very negative supply
shocks that are both contractionary and inflationary  so we are getting hit by the double whammy
the news on inflation has generally not been good even with the recent cpi numbers  but then of
course they are reversed by the ppi numbers today  i dont put that much weight on the actual
current numbers because as you know i take a view that the primary drivers of inflation and
inflation dynamics are inflation expectations and expectations about future output gaps  so thats
the framework in which id like to discuss what will happen on the inflation front
we have two problems in terms of inflation expectations right now  one is the supply
shock which i think is having some effects on inflation expectations and also the viewalthough i
believe its incorrect i do think that theres a problem that this view is widely held outside and
president plosser mentioned thisthat we on the fomc are focused only on growth and are not at
all worried about inflation  this is a communication issue that is hard to deal with because even
though ive been advocating being more aggressive in terms of easing i do worry very much about
the issue that we also have to indicate that if necessary well get out the baseball bat to keep
inflation under control  that is not an easy thing to do  so when i look at inflation expectations
which i consider to be a key driver of inflation i think that the evidence in the data is that we have
had not a big increase but a slight increase in inflation expectations on the order of about 10 basis
points  theres a lot of uncertainty about that it could be a little more than that but i dont think a
whole lot more
also disturbing is that we certainly have had a big increase in longrun inflation uncertainty
thats reflected not only in terms of inflation compensation but also in the fact that people are
buying inflation caps tips are becoming very popular and so forth and so on  in fact one of the
negative things that happened to me as a result of taking this job is that i had my entire tiaacref
in tips and unfortunately i had to divest all of it because they are government securities and that
turned out to be bad  but thats only one of the minor costs of being in this position  laughter
the issue here is that although i dont think that inflation expectations have gotten unhinged at this
pointand i think that we can say that the phrase reasonably well contained is okaythere is a
greater risk that they could get unhinged  now i want to be clear  im not talking about the 1970s
its not that 70s show  i have not been particularly happy with allan meltzers comments about
a bunch of things  the issue here is not that inflation expectations would go to that kind of level
but it could be that inflation expectations go up to 2 or maybe even a little higher and it would be
costly to get that down  thats the concern we have to worry about
but let me talk about the other side because when i think about the inflation dynamics its
not just inflation expectations  i do not believe in the deus ex machina view of the inflation process
something has to tie things down and what ties it down is not current output gapswhich is why i
think the standard phillips curves dont predict very wellbut expectations about future output
gaps  on that score i worry that there could be a lot of downside risk to inflation from that  if
really bad things happen which i think unfortunately is a seriously possibility inflation could fall
a key fact by the way is that if you look at past recessions you do find that inflation falls in the 12
months after recessions  in a couple of cases with supply shocks there was a rise in inflation at the
beginning of the recessions  seven out of eight are in that category  particularly if its a severe
recession its much more likely for inflation to fall  so its not true that theres just upside risk
there is downside risk as well and thats one reason that inflation uncertainty is not an issue just of
potential upside  in fact in the 2003 episode that president lacker mentioned the reason there was
such a sharp rise in inflation compensation was not that people worried about inflation going up but
that they worried that inflation would go down  nonetheless theres still a cost to the fact that long
run inflation expectations are not as solidly grounded as they were before  so my view in general is
that we are facing an incredibly unpleasant tradeoff  we basically have the risk of the economy
turning very sharply and the risk of inflation getting somewhat unhinged  i want to discuss that
later
i wasnt going to discuss this but i just really cant not react to the comments that you
made president fisher  theres a view out there in the media that monetary policy has been
ineffective  this was the statement that i think you made and i think it is just plain wrong  so i
want to discuss it because its actually really important in thinking about a policy stance right now
and its important to think about the economics of this  we have had a very nasty set of
contractionary shocks from the financial sector particularly the widening of credit spreads and the
restriction of credit  so i want us to think about a counterfactual  lets think about a situation in
which we had whats happened and we did not lower interest rates  what would have been the
outcome  do you think that credit spreads would have lowered  i think credit spreads would have
risen  in fact when you think about what credit spreads are being driven byive argued this
beforetheres a valuation riskthe fact that we cant value assets and thats this price discovery
problem that we really cant do that much about  but there is also a macroeconomic risk which is a
lot of whats going on right now particularly in terms of the housing market where people dont
know where housing prices are going to bottom out  the view that they may keep on going
downand we had a very negative number on housing prices recentlymeans that even the aaa
tranches now look as though theyre very vulnerable and therefore the credit spreads on them go
up a whole lot  my view is that monetary policy has been very effective because things would be
much much worse if we hadnt eased  on the other hand we just had an incredibly nasty set of
shocks as a result of what you described were the problems in these sectors
so i really think that this is very important  to finish up on this the example of japan is
constructive because the bank of japan had a view very similar to the one that youve expressed
which is that they had all these problems in the banking sector and the problems were not their
fault  but they then took the view that they couldnt do anything about it  monetary policy was not
the source of the weak economy so they were very slow to lower interest rates  the chairman has
talked about this  every monetary economist who went to the bank of japan during this periodi
did it when i was with the new york fed in the mid1990stold them that their monetary policy
was too tight  they basically said well you know its not too tight and its not our fault that the
banks are all screwed up because of poor regulation  well the result was they ended up with
deflation and they lost ten years of growth  im being a little more blunt than usual but i think that
the economic arguments here are actually central in our discussion
mr fisher  mr chairman may i answer
chairman bernanke  well let him finish  are you done
mr mishkin  i am done yes
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  just very quickly i said that the liquidity situation were in diminishes the
efficacy of fed funds policy im not saying its not a worthwhile tool  second i was fully
supportive until we got to 35  then we went from 35 to 3 percent  everything we wanted to go
one way then went the opposite way  so i just made the observation that it didnt seem to be
effective  third i think i spent even more time in japan than president geithner who is an expert
on japan and you cannot compare the two economies  they are geared totally differently with
totally different efficiency  id be happy to debate that at a later point  i think its a very poor
analogy  now having said that i respect the enormous macroeconomic downside risk that we
haveand i have one of the most pessimistic forecastsbut theres a price to be paid for what
were doing unless it is efficient and that price is reflected in inflation expectations  thats my
point mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman im going to cede all of my time to you
except to acknowledge and to point out that theres much i agree with that has been said around the
table particularly with how people characterize the growth outlook and the risks and whats
happening in financial markets and to the outlook  i cant say that stuff better than it has been said
but theres much i disagree with in whats been said particularly on the inflation side about the
lack of credibility
i just want very quickly to say a couple of things about how we talk about this stuff based on
whats been said  first some of you at this table may believe that we are losing credibility and you
may be losing confidence in the capacity of this committee to mitigate the risk to our longterm
inflation objectives  if you say that in public you will magnify that problem and just because you
believe it does not make it true  i believe that you should have more confidence in the commitment
of this committee to do what is necessary to keep those expectations stable over time  second the
stuff about capital and the financial system is very very important  it is very hard to make the
judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is
undercapitalized  some people out there are saying that  in some states of the world particularly if
there is no liquidity then any financial system will be systematically insolvent  but based on
everything we know today if you look at very pessimistic estimates of the scale of losses across the
financial system on average relative to capital they do not justify that concern  it is very important
to make distinctions in what we say about that  it is very different to say that their distribution is
uneven and to say that for some institutions those losses may be large relative to capital  that is
obviously the case we have already seen that to be the case  it is important to make the distinction
between the average and the distribution  although the average losses look relatively manageable
relative to capital the system is short of capital relative to what would be ideal given that weve
had the collapse of a very large part of the nonbank financial system  banks as a whole are not
large enough now even with their capital cushions to compensate for the scale of disintermediation
of that type of nonbank finance  those are very important distinctions to make in this case
there is nothing more dangerous in what were facing now than for people who are
knowledgeable about this stuff to feed these broad concerns about our credibility and about the
basic core strength of the financial system  so i just want to underscore the importance of
exceptional care in how we talk about those things even in private  a lot of people out there who
should know betternone of us is guilty of thisare casting broad aspersions about solvency that
are very dangerous in this context  may we get to the point where those concerns are justified  of
course we may get to that point  if we systematically mismanage policy we may get to that point
but please be careful in that context
im sorry mr chairman  i meant to cede all my time to you  laughter  finally i have to
state for the record that i did submit our forecast  to state the obvious its close enough to the
greenbook on most things and given the range of uncertainty theres no material between our
view and the greenbooks
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  thank you for all of your comments
let me just briefly summarize and add a few points  to summarize the discussion incoming data
have been weak and some view the economy as having entered recession  housing demand and
construction have continued to decline sharply and houseprice declines have been somewhat
greater than expected  housing weakness has implications for employment for consumer spending
and for credit conditions  it also leads to 21 miles of empty boxcars  laughter
financial conditions have worsened considerably reflecting weakness in housing prices
and credit markets in particular are highly stressed and illiquid  wider spreads have offset some or
all of the decline in safe rates for many credit products and credit conditions are tighter for most
borrowers  financial conditions are likely to be a significant drag on economic growth  some
noted the risk that continued financial turmoil could lead to a more serious and prolonged recession
implying possibly large downside risk to growth  with respect to households consumption growth
has flattened out and there was generally greater pessimism about the labor market and economic
prospects  consumer credit quality may be worsening  payroll employment growth has turned
negative  there was little expectation expressed of strong help from the fiscal stimulus package
firms are generally more pessimistic and cautious but also remain concerned about cost pressures
inventories look to be in balance  exports continue to be an important source of final demand and
will continue to contribute significantly to growth although its possible that growth abroad may
slow
readings on core inflation have been mixed  increases in energy and commodity prices are
important sources of increased headline inflation and some producers have adopted a costplus
mentality  agricultural prices in particular are up a good bit  inflation breakevens are up
somewhat especially at the fivebyfive horizon  the dollar has depreciated potentially adding to
longerterm inflation pressures and adding some risks  however nominal wage increases are
moderate as are unit labor costs and us and global economic weakness could moderate gains in
commodity prices and create domestic economic slack  several members warned about the risk of
losing inflation credibility  any comments thoughts
let me make just a few comments  again im very sympathetic to what almost everyone
has said around the table in particular the fact that were facing a threefront war if you will which
makes this extraordinarily difficult and delicate  i thought in january that we were in recession
that was my view at that time and i certainly believe it now  the greenbook has done a good job
of trying to factor in the data and the other types of evidence  i think im actually slightly darker on
growth than the greenbook is  the reason is that i dont see where the recovery is coming from in
the beginning of next year  in particular we wont have a recovery until financial markets stabilize
and the financial markets wont stabilize until house prices stabilize and there is simply no
particular reason to choose a time for that to happen  so i do think that the downside risks are quite
significant and that this socalled adverse feedback loop is currently in full play  at some point of
course either things will stabilize or there will be some kind of massive governmental intervention
but i just dont have much confidence about the timing of that
i would like to say a word  i would just agree with governor mishkin about the efficacy of
our policy  i think that it has had an effect and it has been beneficial  we obviously affect short
term rates including commercial paper rates and the like which have implications for financing and
for borrowing  we affect the dollar which has mixed effects but on the growth side has some
positive effects  its true as president fisher pointed out that mediumterm and longterm rates
have not fallen because lower treasury rates have been offset by higher spreads but again the
question is the counterfactual  where would we be if we had not lowered rates  i think that lower
rates have both lowered safe rates and offset to some extent the rising concerns about solvency
which have caused the credit spreads to widen  i think this argument can go either way  you can
say that our policy is less effective and therefore we should do more of it  so there are two ways
of looking at that  in addition there may be some benefits for capital formation of low financing
rates and a steep yield curve in keeping bank share prices from entirely collapsing
on inflation i agree with much of whats been said and im very concerned about it  let
me make one simple point though which i dont think has been adequately discussed  ninetyfive
percent of the inflation that were seeing is either the direct or the indirect effect of globally traded
commodity pricesfood energy and other commodities  what is happening is that there is a
change in the relative price of say oil and the wage of an ohio manufacturing worker  theres a
relative price change going on  that has to happen one way or the other  it can happen either by
overall increases in the nominal price of oil which are reflected in overall increases in headline cpi
inflation or by lower or negative growth in nominal wages  now if we have temporary movements
in these relative prices i think all the theory tells us that the best way to let that relative price change
happen is to let the shock feed through let the prices of energy commodities and so on rise accept
a temporary increase in headline inflation and focus on making sure that the increase in headline
inflation doesnt feed through into domestic core inflation say through wages or domestic prices
a good response to that is well weve had a lot of temporary shocks here and they have gone on
for a long time  thats certainly true  but again it was very difficult to anticipate how these prices
have moved
looking forward the futures markets have been wrong and wrong but they are the best we
have  in my view if we think about the likely slowdown in the us economy and the global
economy there are going to be some forces that will prevent commodity prices from continuing to
rise the way they have been rising which ought to take the pressure off the inflation process  that
being said i fully recognize that there has been a bit of movement in some of the indicators  i think
i like the use of the index measure  it uses lots of different indicators  i dont think we should
overemphasize inflation compensation  for example the oneyear inflation compensation three and
four years out has moved up less than the fivebyfive and i think for good reasons  the fiveby
five could reflect again general uncertainty  it could also reflect more volatility in the relative price
changes of oil for example  if we think theres more volatility in that if its up or down that would
create more uncertainty about headline inflation and would feed through into that spread
frankly in thinking about inflation i am concerned about inflation expectations and the
general psychology  im hopeful at least that it will moderate as commodity prices moderate
although of course no one can know for sure  i agree with governor warsh that from a financial
perspective on the inflation side the greater dangers are in the currency area  exchange rates are
very poorly tied down by fundamentals except over very long periods of timei think ken rogoff
had a paper in which he said that over maybe 600 years or so the ppp finally works  laughter  so
a lot of psychology is there  i think that it is an important issue  we need to think about what the
treasury will say and those sorts of things  that is a concern and i consider that in some sense a
greater risk at this point
so there are risks on both sides  i think that the downside risks including the financial risks
at this point are greaternot to belittle inflation risks which i think are quite significant  we are
obviously going to have to make tradeoffs about how to deal with these  using both our policy
tools and our communication is very important  i agree with vice chairman geithner that we need
and i needand i have a very important role hereto maintain clarity in communication about our
attention to inflation that we are not ignoring that side of the mandate
finally let me just say as i said last night at the dinner with the presidents that i think we
are getting to the point where the federal reserves tools both its liquidity tools and its interest rate
tools are not by themselves sufficient to resolve our troubles  more help more activity from the
congress and the administration to address housing issues for example would be desirable  we
are certainly working on those issues here at the board and i will be talking to people in
washington about what might be done to try to address more fundamentally these issues of the
housing market and the financial markets  so those are my comments  why dont we turn now to
brian for an introduction to the policy round
mr madigan2  thanks mr chairman  i will be referring to the revised version of table 1 distributed earlier today in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  the revised table presents the same basic set of alternatives that was discussed in the bluebook  however we have proposed some changes in language that affect the statements for alternatives a and
b  i will discuss those changes shown in blue shortly
alternative d presented in the righthand column would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting at 3 percent  committee members might be inclined to favor this alternative if they were particularly concerned about prospects for inflation and if they believed that with due allowance for lags the monetary and fiscal stimulus in train would likely be sufficient to lead to a resumption of moderate growth over time  the wording of this alternative would acknowledge the downside risks to growth  but as shown in paragraph 3 the statement would indicate that inflation has been elevated cite several factors that could put additional upward pressure on inflation and state that the upside risks to inflation have increased  no net assessment of the balance of risks would be included
under alternative c the stance of policy would be eased by 25 basis points today  a modest easing of policy might be motivated by judgments that the economic outlook has weakened but by appreciably less than in the greenbook and that the inflation outlook is troubling  members might see financial strains as concerning but likely to exert less restraint on growth than in the greenbook forecast

2  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
in these circumstances the committee might want to be cautious about policy adjustments that could add impetus to inflation particularly given the substantial easing of monetary policy to date and the lags in the effects of policy  the language proposed for alternative c would note that the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing correction are likely to continue to weigh on economic growth  the inflation paragraph for this alternative is the same as that for alternative
d  as shown in paragraph 4 the committee would make an explicit judgment that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation
under alternative b the committee would reduce the federal funds rate 50 basis points today to 2 percent  such an approach could be seen as consistent with the greenbook forecast  indeed under that forecast the committee is assumed to ease policy 50 basis points at this meeting and another 75 basis points over the next three months  the motivation for such a trajectory is provided partly by the 1 percentage point downward revision to the greenbookconsistent measure of shortrun r  the committee might concur with the staffs assumption regarding the amount of cumulative easing that will eventually prove necessary and find a gradual shift in policy attractive particularly in view of what seems to be some upward drift of late in inflation expectations  such a path would also be qualitatively consistent with the optimal control simulations shown in the bluebook for a 2 percent inflation target in which the federal funds rate is eventually eased to around 1 percent  as shown in paragraph 2 the statement issued under this alternative would indicate that the outlook had weakened  we have suggested striking the reference to risks as that thought is picked up in the risk assessment  the statement would go on to mention several factors that could weigh on economic growth and we have suggested adding over the next few quarters
with regard to inflation the committee would note that inflation has been elevated  it would also indicate an expectation that inflation will moderate in coming months and cite several factors that could contribute to that moderation but note that uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased  notably the list does not mention reasonably well anchored inflation expectations or some variant of that phrase which has been used recently in the minutes and other policy communications  indeed the first sentence of the paragraph notes that some indicators of inflation expectations have risen  partly because inflation compensation includes a premium for inflation risk as well as inflation expectations we thought that indicators of inflation expectations might be a better word than measures and have suggested that substitution  over the past few days inflation compensation as read from tips has plunged however we are skeptical that the decline represents primarily a drop in inflation expectations or inflation risk  rather we suspect that it is importantly a result of shifting liquidity premiums as yields on nominal treasury securities have fallen sharply partly because of increased demands for safety and liquidity  the final paragraph of alternative b would repeat the risk assessment issued after the january meeting  it would again indicate that downside risks remain and emphasize that the committee will act in a timely manner to address those risks
finally under alternative a the committee would lower the funds rate 75 basis points today  given the extent of policy easing assumed in the staff forecast this alternative could easily be consistent with an outlook along the lines of the greenbook  this policy approach could also be motivated by concern about the possible implications for the economic outlook of the worsening in financial market conditions in the five days since the staff forecast was finalized or by a risk management approach that gave particular weight to the downside risks around the outlook
the language proposed for the rationale section paragraphs 2 and 3 of  alternative a is identical to that proposed for alternative b  as with alternative b the risk assessment paragraph says that policy actions should promote moderate growth over time and mitigate downside risks but this version also alludes to the measures that the federal reserve has implemented to promote market liquidity  this language could also be used in alternative b  rather than providing an assessment of the balance of risks as we did in the bluebook version here in alterative a we have suggested simply indicating that downside risks to growth remain  given the high degree of uncertainty you might again prefer not to make an overall risk assessment this paragraph differs from the corresponding part of the january statement also by indicating that the committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability  thus while the committee eases
75 basis points this language of alternative a would signal some increase in the committees concern about inflation in several ways  by indicating that inflation has been elevated by noting that some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and by incorporating a traditional formulation of the dual objectives including price stability in the final sentence
as bill noted this morning market participants appear to place substantial odds on a 100 basis point policy move at this meeting  thus implementation of any of these alternatives would involve at least somewhat less easing than expected  given what would appear to be very fragile market conditions and highly skittish investor sentiment you might see somewhat greater risks than usual in diverging from market expectations and obviously the risks would be larger the greater the gap between anticipation and your actions  at the same time you might see good reasons for some divergence  first and most obviously you might see a smaller move as appropriately calibrated given your outlook and sense of the risks  also some indicators do seem to suggest that inflation expectations have become a bit less firmly moored  even if you see gradual dollar depreciation as likely to be appropriate given the weakness of the us economy and quite possibly a necessary factor in fostering an improved current account balance over time you may be concerned about the downward lurch in the dollar over recent days and the potential for disorderly conditions to develop  you may judge that a policy decision today to implement somewhat less easing than markets expect and a statement that implies somewhat greater concern about inflation could be helpful in leaning against inflation expectations and any sense in markets that you are indifferent to downward pressure on the dollar
alternative a would likely prompt some increase in shorterterm interest rates but given that the risk assessment would point to continued downside risks market participants would infer that further easing is a likely prospect and the effects on other financial asset prices and financial conditions more generally could be reasonably limited  the 50 basis point easing of alternative b in contrast would suggest to market participants that you are inclined to be considerably more cautious in easing policy further even with the downside risk assessment and short and intermediateterm interest rates could ratchet considerably higher equity prices decline and credit conditions tightenresponses that presumably would be amplified perhaps nonlinearly under alternatives c and d
chairman bernanke  thank you  bill
mr dudley  i just want to update the dealer survey  we got two more responses  two
people moved from 75 to 100  so right now as we speak it is ten in the 100 camp eight in the
75 camp and two in the 50 camp
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  questions  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman it is kind of awkward to ask this in the
midst of a meeting but i think it is important  i think there was a pretty big change this morning at
least in risk perceptions today across a bunch of markets  can you tell what the fed funds curve has
done this morning
mr dudley  i think that the april fed funds futures contract earlier this morning was
priced at 199 and it was up by 4 basis points  i dont know if it moved subsequently
mr madigan  vice chairman it has moved up somewhat further at least as of maybe
an hour ago  it looked as though at least for this meeting the odds were roughly evenly balanced
between 75 and 100 in terms of what was priced in
mr dudley  stocks are up about 2 percent  both lehmans and goldmans earnings
showed declines but they were less significant than expected  so share prices for both of them have
rallied a lot  lehmans stock was up 19 percent when i last lookedi dont know where it is today
so a lot of reversals occurred yesterday in terms of the investment banks
vice chairman geithner  financial credit default swaps this morning are much
much narrower  may i raise a conceptual question around this though  maybe this is really for
you mr chairman  how should we think about the tradeoff between what we do with the fed
funds rate and whatever effect we have on liquidity and credit spreads which are obviously in some
ways working against the reduction of the fed funds rate  it doesnt seem to me quite right to say
that they are perfect tradeoffs
chairman bernanke  no
vice chairman geithner  i guess my question is dont they have independent
effects  i mean they are separate and somewhat different in terms of how we think about
mitigating the risk to the overall economy
chairman bernanke  i would think of them as complementarythey are not strong
substitutes obviouslyin the sense that as is often pointed out the liquidity measures can affect
credit and solvency concerns
vice chairman geithner  so maybe to echo the dialogue that you had with
governor mishkin if we were to be successful through taking out some of the liquidity risk of
markets more generally and we got those spreads maybe back down toi dont know50 in a
crude proxy sense that would be good and powerful but we would still be left with exceptionally
tight financial conditions relative to the given target fed funds rate  is that fair  i mangled that
mr mishkin  yes  im not arguing that lowering the federal funds rate narrows these
spreads a whole lot  it certainly works in that direction but there is a big independent movement
because of both fear in the markets and some liquidity concerns which is why i think it is very
important for us to have both sets of tools  we have tools that can work on the issue of expectations
about monetary policy and stance but to the extent that we can use other tools thats also extremely
helpful  it is not that we think we can solve all the problems particularly because these shocks are
so large  this is one problem that we are facing which is that this disruption is really big big time
so then the question is whether we want to use all the tools at our disposal that we can
chairman bernanke  brian
mr madigan  i just want to make one point to the vice chairmans question  the way
i think about this is that monetary policy tends to move continuously  of course the federal funds
rate is essentially continuous but what we are doing with liquidity measures is designed to combat
nonlinearities to the extent that theyre discontinuities and so i think they have a different
qualitative feel  were attempting to prevent a breakdown in markets and allow monetary policy
thereby to operate more normally in a more continuous way
vice chairman geithner  i guess another way to frame the question is if we are
reasonably successful in mitigating this adverse feedback dynamic in markets and the effects that
has on financial conditions would we still need to lower the nominal fed funds rate further to
achieve the forecast laid out in the board staffs greenbook
mr stockton  the answer to that would be yes  when we layered on significant
additional negative addfactors for this recession scenario they really werent directly tied to our
reading of liquidity in financial markets but a reading of the real economy
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i think the issue here relates to the whole question about nongradualism
that weve been talking about  clearly if we got lucky and financial markets turned around in a
major way then the stance of monetary policy would need to change actually very rapidly  this is
one of the issues facing usa communication issue which is how we indicate to the markets and
the public in a serious way that we really care about keeping inflation under control  im not sure
what the answer to that is  it is one of the great challenges that were facing at this particular
juncture  clearly part of it is that we dont want interest rates to be particularly low  in fact the
higher interest rates could be for us the happier we would be because that would be an indication
that financial conditions had turned around a lot  however the problem of course is that inflation
expectations get unhinged
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman vice chairman geithner is asking in an elegant way about
the issue of efficacy which i was trying to touch on and did so in a less sophisticated way  i just
want to make sure that i understand your answer  if we were to achieve the degree of success that
tim roughly estimated we would lessen that pressure  from a staff standpoint what degree of
easing would you advocate  would it be a lesser degree than what is imputed into the
mr stockton  i cant really answer that question  over this intermeeting period we
were coping with two important developments  one was that we saw some increase in overall
measures of financial stress  as you know we went to a forecast back in september when they first
emerged and started marking down the level of gdp to account for that  we did a little more in this
forecast to account for what we perceived to be an increase in financial stress  but the bigger factor
in marking down our forecasts significantly this year was a reading that we were switching from a
sense of a slowgrowth scenario and moving into something like a more nonlinear downturn of the
economy  that motivated the more significant portion of the downward movement that we had in
the equilibrium real interest rate here
chairman bernanke  okay  president evans
mr evans  well i just want to clarify this because i didnt get the answer i was
expecting  i dont think i understood exactly the question about financial stress because i thought
the question was whether we would have to do more with the funds rate to achieve what was in the
greenbook  did you mark down your outlook from the greenbook  i dont think i understood
mr stockton  i guess i was thinking more along the marginal change that we would
make should the factors be more successful than were currently anticipating them to be  that
would probably cause us to edge up our path of the fed funds rate to account for that
mr evans  okay  got it  thanks
chairman bernanke  any other questions for brian  with your indulgence it has
been a very volatile period with a lot of changes in views  were also a little short of time  i think it
might be more focused if i gave a proposal and had people react to it  president plosser made the
correct point that we need to think about the level of the funds rate  where should it be  i think it
needs to be lower frankly  in our last meeting at 3 percent many of us viewed that as about neutral
without much insurance  since then weve seen i believe a much stronger indication of recession
an increase in downside risks  when i spoke about the downside risks in the congress and in
speeches i cited three categories of risks  housing finance and labor markets  all of those have
transpired in that direction  so i do think we have to respond effectively against that  for that
reason i would recommend the 75 basis point reduction  i recognize the concerns people have and
i have them myself about both inflation and the dollar  so i would make two comments regarding
that  first we will be even now disappointing the market somewhat  a more aggressive ease is
built in  second as brian already indicated in a number of places in alternative a which i am
proposing we have ratcheted up the language about inflation notably in paragraph 3 where we talk
about it being elevated and inflation expectations and in the last sentence where we reinstitute price
stability and clarify what our dual mandate is
minor comments  im open to anything but i point out that in paragraph 3 we added the list
of explanations for why inflation may moderate  we didnt have that last time  if people are
uncomfortable with that we can take that out  the other thing we added in paragraph 4 was the
comment about market liquidity measures  i think thats useful  it shows that were doing other
things  it creates a sense that theres more going on besides monetary policy  but again if people
have strong objections i have no strong feelings about that  in addition my recommendation would
include maintaining the discount rate difference of  percentage point that we established on
sunday  so thats where i would be  why dont we now have a rapid goround  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i think this is a mistake  i want to take just a second  i
understand why weve been lowering the rate trying to keep the problems from spreading over to
the real economy  ive been reluctant because our practice has been to go too low and to create a
new set of circumstances that we have to deal with although ive understood given the seriousness
of this financial crisis that weve had to go down  i have been and continue to be very supportive
of the use of our taf and our other vehicles to provide liquidity to the market to help address and
stanch the panic  the fact of the matter is though that there is an enormous amount of loss
whether there is enough capital in the banking industry we know that there is a solvency issue out
there and these actions while they provide liquidity cannot solve that problem  thats where fiscal
policy goes  but im not sure that our continuing to lower rates isnt allowing others who should be
addressing this to look to us to solve the problem that is not ours to solve and that concerns me
about where we are
the fed funds rate at 3 percent nominal i think is a stimulative rate in terms of where the
real fed funds rate is  in an environment where we now move down even lower than that we are
inviting other speculative activities  liquidity has to go somewhere and it is going there fast  i
think theres a danger in doing that and this 3 percent will stimulate the economy forward  two
and a quarter will stimulate the economy forward and introduce other significant risks both to
speculative activity and to inflation and thats why i think we should be more careful in going
forward  now doing nothing will shock the market but ill tell you that the market has been
shocked as much by some of the new actions we have taken as if we said here it is at 3 percent
there are a lot of people on the sidelines waiting for us to stop so that they can come in and take
advantage of the situation  so there are lots of reasons that i would much prefer to hold at this
period and i felt compelled to express that view  thank you
chairman bernanke  certainly  president rosengren
mr rosengren  news of the problems at bear stearns and the very fragile situation in
financial markets complicate our decision today  federal funds futures indicate that the market is
anticipating a reduction of at least 75 basis points and probably more than that  normally the
expectations of financial market participants would not factor heavily in my decisionmaking
however given the fragility in the market and my own expectation that even with this move
further easing will be necessary i strongly prefer alternative a  while i view alternative b as a
significant action i would have concerns about likely market reaction given the gravity of the
situation in financial markets and the possibility that a recession may not be mild given falling
collateral values and financial difficulties at many of our major financial institutions  a 50 basis
point move would merely offset the increase in credit spreads that we have seen since the past
meeting  in addition the boston forecast and the greenbook forecast with a 50 basis point ease
leave the unemployment rate well above the nairu but with inflation rates below 2 percent by the
end of 2009  easing less than 50 basis points at this meeting would seem entirely inconsistent with
the economic and financial deterioration we have seen since the last meeting
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  weve spoken a lot about inflation
expectations here today  let me at the outset emphasize that what im referring to in the measures
we have are the expectations of the public  theyre not necessarily my expectations or governor
mishkins vice chairman geithners or the committees and they dont necessarily correspond to
the reality of the distribution of inflation realized five years five years hence if each of us had our
druthers or if the committee as a whole lasted that long together and conducted policy the way it
best saw fit  i trust that no member would deliberately encourage continued discrepancy between
what they viewed as objective reality and the publics expectations  but that said that discrepancy
is not the same as less commitment on our part  its certainly the same as less credibility about
commitment on our part  i think and trust that most members when speaking in public about
inflation expectations would endeavor to reduce that discrepancy  presumably each of us has a
threshold for acceptable inflation expectations that if it were crossed would induce us to be willing
to disappoint market expectations  personally my threshold has been crossed so i think that if we
ease we should ease much less aggressively than markets expect
more broadly i think of this in terms of the following question  what strategy would we
want people to believe we will follow in future episodes like this  as i pointed out in my letter to
the committee last week thinking in terms of our strategy is different from a meetingbymeeting
approach that takes the publics current expectations wherever they are as given  we should ask i
believe what expectations we would have wanted them to have had about our behavior during
episodes like this  do we want people to believe that we will follow a policy that allows inflation
and inflation expectations to ratchet up permanently whenever growth slows  i dont think so but
that seems to be what the market believes were doing  conceivably we could try to use our
statements and minutes to communicate our intention to bring inflation down but at this point my
sense is that our statements about inflation appear to be taken as much less revealing than our
actions
this is a uniquely challenging episode in the history of our economy and our institution  i
have found it useful to remind myself from time to time about the limits of central banking  we
cannot prevent this recession and its doubtful to me that we could have or should have even if we
had had perfect foresight  we are unlikely as i said to have much effect on the ultimate magnitude
of mortgage losses at this point and i dont think we can do much to accelerate the resolution of
uncertainty about those losses  we cannot resolve uncertainty about the fundamentals underlying
the creditworthiness of financial market counterparties and we cannot enhance the liquidity of any
financial instrument without altering its relative price  what can we do  we can control inflation
and we can limit the extent to which uncertainty about our inflation intentions adds to market
volatility  to do this i like the idea of being clear about our strategy  i take that as consistent with
what president plosser was advocating that we concern ourselves with what level we see as
appropriate now and see as likely to be appropriate later this year  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i support your proposal for a 75 basis point cut
and the language thats proposed for alternative a  as i said in my comments im very concerned
about economic growth and agree basically with the greenbook perspective  i think we are into an
adverse feedback loop and i agree with the bluebook assessment that the equilibrium real funds
rate has dropped substantially maybe into negative territory  i dont believe in gradualism in
circumstances like these  i think the argument for moreaggressive action now is similar to when
inflation is very low and we face the zero bound for nominal interest rates  i agree with governor
mishkins comments about the lessons of japan  i think that the sooner appropriate stimulus is put
in place the less likely it is that policy will end up facing very unpleasant consequences of
essentially reaching the zero bound in this case because of a prolonged and severe recession  so id
like to see the funds rate moved down to where it needs to go sooner rather than later
i think the appropriate level of the funds rate is one that would provide some insurance
against really bad outcomes for the economy and i dont see this move as taking us into insurance
territory yet  so i understand the constraints that you have weighed into this decision having to do
with the psychology of inflation expectations and the dollar and probably this is as far as we can go
sensibly today but i think it is important to move as much as we can
if the moves prove unnecessary i think we can reverse the stance of policy quickly with a
good chance of avoiding inflationary problems  i agree with governor mishkins views on risk
management policy in the face of financial shocks  we had an interesting discussion last time about
the possibility that a quick reversal might mean that we dont have much stimulative effect on
spending now because we may not lower longterm interest rates enough and i think that was good
food for thought  but having spent some time thinking about it i think that a lower funds rate will
actually lower longterm rates in part because by reducing the probability of a financial crisis we
will bring risk premiums down which will lower longterm rates  a lower funds rate will also be
stimulative because a good deal depends on short and intermediateterm rates  i think there are
also a number of other ways in which short rates matter to spending through channels like raising
firms profitability and cash flow and lowering the stress from arm resets  so i strongly support
the action that you recommend
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i also support your proposal both the action and
the language of alternative a  i think its an appropriate response to the developing situation and i
do think that the language will help us on the inflation front  let me elaborate a bit
weve had a marked deterioration in the outlook as everybody around the table has seen
and has agreed with  i do think as president yellen and others have said that a decline in the
federal funds rate will be helpful in mitigating the recessionary tendencies in the economy  the
decline of 75 basis points is not as much as the greenbook r decline but i think its appropriate
and reasonable to await more evidence about whether at some point we need to go further  the
resulting real federal funds rate would be approximately zero using core inflation and i think thats
a reasonable place to be given the weight of the constraining factors in the economic outlook
particularly from the credit markets  i use core in thinking about the real funds rate because i do
think that even a zero real funds rate under these circumstances at least for a time will be consistent
with inflation coming down as commodity prices level out and as resource utilization goes down
i agree with brian that there could be a bit of an adverse reaction in financial markets
because its not quite as much as theyre expecting but with that risk sentence in paragraph 4 it
shouldnt be too bad  i do think its consistent with heightened attention by the committee to
inflation and inflation expectations for the reasons you gave mr chairman  its less than the
market expects and both paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 increase the attention to inflation and
inflation risk  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i support your recommendation  i came in here
thinking that i preferred 50 basis points but i also recognize that i expected that we would have to
go beyond that after this meeting  so i fully support 75 and the language that you discussed
i just want to take a minute to give my perspective on the discussion earlier about the 1970s
and inflation expectations  i certainly didnt expect when i came onto the committee that we would
be lowering rates as much as we have done and i thought we would be more concerned about
inflation but this is where we are and i think it is the appropriate response  inflation expectations
risk reminds me of paul volcker hero of the federal reserve system  why is that  he broke
inflation expectations  how did he do that  well when i talked with my colleague larry
christiano he reminded me that it wasnt really by reducing money growth  m1 growth increased
during that period and yet financial conditions were restrictive  there was a big recession  there
was a lot of resource slack and that was really important for bringing inflation down
i agree  i think were in a situation where this is most likely a recession  i expect that it will
reduce pressures on inflation  thats my forecast  i think its consistent with the earlier period and
its hard to know exactly how much it will bring inflation down but i think that it will lower
inflation  the greenbook is calling for a recession  they could be wrong but weve been chasing
them down the whole time and id be very surprised if they were wrong
i would like to know where the bottom of the funds rate cycle is  like financial market
participants who want to know what the value of their mortgage securities is id like to know where
the bottom of the funds rate is  but that is wholly unrealistic at this point  we just dont know  so
i would be hopeful for eventually something like the greenbook path assumption  but i support the
recommendation  combined with our separate attempts to relieve financial market stress we have
two prongs going and that is very helpful  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well as somebody said recently there are no
altogether good choices  i strongly support the recommendation and the language that goes with it
a couple of weeks ago i thought the funds rate probably should go to 2 percent  i got there
basically by saying well given what i know about current conditions the outlook and everything
3 percent is not a bad level  but there are a lot of things i dont know and its likely that some
events are going to occur in the next couple of weeks or sometime in the future that may disturb
things and as a little insurance for that 2 would be a good idea  well those eventsim talking
about bear stearns and other disruptionsoccurred sooner rather than later so it seems to me that
we need to go to 2 and then ask ourselves whether we want some additional insurance  my
answer to that is yes  so im perfectly comfortable with taking the funds rate down  percentage
point now  does it strike the appropriate balance between our concerns about financial conditions
and the outlook and inflation and inflation expectations on the other side  i dont know  but as i
said at the outset of this i dont know that there are any altogether good choices  i think this is
about as good as we can do under these circumstances
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman i dont like being obtuse and being a people person i
dont like being unpopular  but i
mr mishkin  were always going to love you come on  laughter
participant  we dont like being unpopular either
participant  happy birthday  laughter
mr fisher  i just cant bring myself to go that far mr chairman  i listened very
carefully to what was said at the table and implicit in tims question to me was would you be
willing to do something  the answer is yes but not as much as youre suggesting  i try as hard
as possible even though ive made my living in financial markets to ignore the reports that we
were just given as we started this conversation because what were paid to do and what i believe is
our duty and obligation to do is whats right for the longterm interests of the economy
i am more bearish now than before and i was an outlier on the bearish side of economic
growth  ive been at the lower end of the range but i also believe that we have significant
inflationary concerns  i have a further point to add to president hoenigsi agree with his
intervention  i think that by being accommodative we are encouraging others who have a role to
play hereyou mentioned them yourself mr chairmanto sit back and let us do the job  to me
the combination of inflationary pressures which i consider to be real imputing into a much weaker
economic growth scenario which i have thought for a long time means that we cannot do this job
alone  the fact of the matter is that we have undertaken significant liquidity enhancement
initiatives and i think were going to have to do more and ive been fully supportive of them but i
think 75 basis points mr chairman is way too much  my thought is that it encourages the
financial markets  theyre not going to be satisfied  i said this last time  its jabba the hutt  they
will keep asking for more and more  we have to quit feeding them  im in a pizza mode by the
way in this conversation  i do have a suggestion however
mr mishkin  you mean pizza the hutt not jabba the hutt  laughter
mr fisher  pizza the hutt thats right  vice chairman geithner made a very interesting
point and that was that we have to be very careful about how we talk about inflation and even
saying what we think  what worries me about going down alternative as path if thats the
wisdom of the committee is that the second paragraph says a little too much of what we think  it
really says that were not done  if you want to say that thats fine but it keeps hammering on even
after 75 basis points that things are soft things are soft things are soft  you may disagree with me
on that but i would suggest that we take out the justification reflecting in paragraph 3 a projected
leveling out of energy and other commodities  to me thats a wing and a prayer and you
suggested that you might be willing to take it out  were i you advocating 75 basis points acting as
i think you are about to act with one dissent i would take that wing and a prayer language out of
there
then i would suggest one other thingin fact i would ask for one other thing  in the very
last sentencethe committee will act in a timely matter as needed to promote sustainable
economic growth without sacrificing longterm price stabilitythats really what were talking
about on the upside and on the downside  so i would ask for that change because thats really what
were saying  youre saying that were worried about the downside  were all worried about that
but were going to promote sustainable economic growth without sacrificing longterm price
stability  those are my suggestions mr chairman and thank you for putting up with me
chairman bernanke  always a pleasure  laughter  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i came to the meeting preferring
alternative b50 basis points  i certainly can bring myself to support your proposal75 basis
points  i dont view it as a fist pounder but let me make the case for 50 basis points at least as i
think about it  first i do think it is a movement that acknowledges financial instability and the
growing real weakness  as i argued in my earlier remarks it may set the scene for decoupling rate
policy from liquidity actions if conditions allow  i think the action makes a minimal
acknowledgement of inflation risk and it may signal the view that lower rates can do only so much
and that best case the market will have to proceed to sort out the market problems and worst case
the fiscal authorities will have to deal with them  although i am not a trained psychologist let me
just propose that in dealing with market psychology there may be some value in appearing to firm
up our ratemovement policy and to set one element in the fluid situation with greater fixity than it
has been in recent weeks  that might generate the kind of firming dynamic and even help produce
a turn in psychology  thats a lot to ask for simply 50 basis points but i also prefer the language of
alternative a to that of alternative b and i think brian said that you could conceivably apply
alternative a language substantially to a 50 basis point cut  so in general i like that approach
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i support your recommendation  as i said
earlier i do see the risks to the greenbook baseline as being skewed to the downside because of
the absence of any signs of a bottoming out in the housing market  as others have mentioned i
am concerned about the risk that we will have a more protracted recession  at the same time the
shortterm inflation environment has deteriorated  i am also concerned about inflation
expectations becoming unanchored  as governor mishkin and others have said today we face
some very unpleasant tradeoffs but in the end i support being more aggressive in our policy
actions today  i am hopeful that as others have said the language that we have added in
paragraph 3 about inflation risks and a reminder in the assessmentofrisk paragraph about our
dual mandate will be helpful in keeping inflation expectations from rising further  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president sapenaro
mr sapenaro  mr chairman excluding for the moment the markets expectations
of a significant downward policy move at this meeting i have a strong preference for
alternative d like president hoenig  i see widespread evidence that the upside risk to inflation
has increased appreciably as evidenced by rapid money growth a depreciating dollar rising
prices of energy and commodities traded on the world markets and higher inflation
compensation in bond markets  however as we all know the market does expect a significant
reduction in the funds rate from this meeting partly because of the state of the economy partly
because of the turbulence in the financial markets and partly because of past statements and
communications from committee members  consequently under these conditions i believe that
a failure to accommodate much of this expectation would produce additional major market
turmoil  hence i was prepared to accept a 50 basis point reduction coming into the meeting and
with some trepidation can accept a 75 basis point reduction  in my view however it would be
desirable for the committees communications going forward to emphasize that we have not lost
our zeal to fight inflation and that further rate cuts cannot solve solvency problems without
unacceptable future inflation  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as i mentioned in my first goround and
like rick i have been terribly depressed on multiple dimensions about what is going on and have
struggled mightily in trying to think about what appropriate policy is going forward and as
president lacker suggested about what our strategy is as we move forward  i certainly believe
that easing of policy is appropriate in a weaker economy and i have supported that  but as i
alluded to earlierand mr chairman as you saidi do believe that a weaker economy does
not mean that we continue to cut rates as long as the economy is weak  we need to calibrate the
level of the funds rate i think it is very important  i think the markets seem to have the
expectation that it is the rate of change not the level that matters  that concerns me and feeds
into some of the problems that we are facing  i wont elaborate any more about expectations
which i mentioned before  but i would prefer actions as well as language that reinforced our
commitment to price stability and a pause today in our rate cuts  i think that the language of
alternative d would accomplish that  but i also believe that a more modest cut combined with
language such as that in alternative d might accomplish the same thing  i am afraid that an
aggressive move combined with the language that we have in a or b feeds the belief that we
have placed aside our commitment to price stability and the expectation that we will continue to
cut rates for the foreseeable future and that there is no bottom in sight
we have talked a lot about taking out insurance around this table  i believe the time has
come to buy some insurance against our waning credibility about restraining inflation  that does
not mean that we couldnt choose to continue to make rate cuts at some future date should that
be called for  ultimately if we wish inflation expectations to be well anchored we must act in a
way that is consistent with such an outcome  words are simply not enough  reputational
capital whether it be for a central bank an academic institution or the brand capital of a firm is
very hard to build  but most of us know in the private sector and in other sectors that capital
can be easily squandered  we must not let that happen
i appreciate mr chairman your comments regarding the idea that we may be reaching
the limits of what monetary policy and the central bank can do  i very much agree with that  at
the risk of maybe sounding a bit trite to some of my colleagues who are familiar with thisi
dont mean it that way because this expresses some of my concernsi would like to remind my
colleagues of a quotation of milton friedman which he made in 1968 that we are in danger of
assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform in danger of asking it to
accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve and as a result in danger of preventing it from making
the contribution that it is capable of making  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  a couple of quick introductory points  first
i have total confidence in the fed and the fomc certainly over the course of my couple of years
here in effectively handling these challenges which is key to highlight at the outset of my
remarks  i have total confidence in this institutions ability in particular to handle both sides of
the dual mandate  moreover i would say that i have total confidence in our ability to have a
really robust discussion here and recognize as president geithner pointed out the fragility in
these financial markets  a lot of our strength comes from being able to have very open tough
discussions with each other and recognize that if they were in the public square they could be
misinterpreted and destabilizing  i think he is right that we all need to take that into account
particularly over this next intermeeting period which we all hope lasts six weeks  moreover i
think that the power of our tools our creativity and our innovative abilities over november
december and these recent weeks has been incredibly impressive  i think that those will work
in concert with monetary policy  i would underscore a point that the chairman made which is
that we have taken a huge burden on ourselves and that the burden will have to be matched by
others here in washingtonand i suspect before we get too much into the second and third
quarter by others around the worldwhich will go a long way toward helping us accomplish our
objectives
second i have total confidence in us financial institutions over the medium term to
deal with these issues  they will come out of this thing stronger smarter and faster and will be
huge net exporters of services but that is going to take a while  my own view is that the capital
raising is good and very important  if the tail is as fat as we have discussed capitalraising by
these institutions should help them stave off safety and soundness issues that could arise  so i
think that it is good prudential management by them and us alike
to the task at hand on monetary policy i will support alternative a as the chairman
recommends and i take particular comfort in the narrative and language in a as being a very
important next step for us to guard against risks on the currency front and on the inflation front
now these words themselves wont do a ton in the short term and they wont have an
immediate effect but i do think it is important for us to take these and build on them in our
private and public statements  so that gives me some comfort  on the decision of 50 points
versus 75 points i would be kidding myself if i thought that those 25 basis points were
completely consequential  i wouldnt ascribe virtue or vice to that sort of bidasked spread  i
would say that it is a hard call  i share the view expressed by some that these markets are going
to need to be disappointed at some point here  that is the only way the words that we express
will be properly understood and taken into account in the markets judgments and i worry that
we are not going to have any great opportunities to disappoint them over the course of the
upcoming meetings
finally let me say this  i will end where i started in this discussion which is at the end
of the day it is this institutions credibility that is paramount and that is increasingly the case at
this point in the cycle  it strikes me that we have to continue to make the case in the upcoming
months that we have the will the wisdom and the tools to tackle these issues  to the extent that
monetary policy is perceived by pundits and fed watchers as not working it is important that we
rebut those arguments and explain that our tools will work over time and that we are looking for
assistance both in washington and in other nations capitals  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  obviously as i said before we are in a very uncertain
situation with respect to inflation  we have slowing economic growth but we have also had
very elevated prices  we had a very low unemployment rate and a very low rate of wage
inflation so we have to worry a little about whether we will get the benefits of lower resource
utilization in terms of lower inflation  but when we look back historically at previous
slowdowns as president stern mentioned about 199091 and as we have discussed about
199899 when we didnt actually have a formal slowdown the committee cut rates and we
didnt have a burst of inflation  obviously after the slowdown in 2001 the main challenge was
concern about inflation getting too low rather than getting too high at that point  if we look over
the past few cyclesand i think markets are aware of thosewe see that you can have cuts in
the federal funds rate that dont lead to inflation getting out of control both when the economy is
growing strongly and when the economy is quite weak  so although i do think that the situation
is uncertain i dont think that the markets would read a cut of 75 basis points today as a lack of
commitment to inflation control  i think there is a lot of historical evidence that suggests that it
is not necessarily inconsistent with that in any way
the slight uptick that we have seen in some but not all of the surveys doesnt suggest that
our inflation credibility has been lost  i think it is very difficult to read what the markets are
saying because just look at the volatility over the past few days  are those tips spreads really
telling us about dramatic changes in the markets views of our credibility regarding what we are
going to do in fighting inflation  i dont find that credible  there are a lot of other things that
are going on that make it very difficult for us to read something out of that
so i support alternative a  my thinking is actually very much along the lines of
president sternsthat we need to take out at least a little insurance going forward  the
statement in alternative a does a very good job of talking about some of the concerns about
inflation  with respect to whether or not we include the explanation of why we expect inflation
to come down in coming quarters one of the things that changed in this version relative to the
earlier ones is that there is no explicit mention of inflation expectations which i think is right
because there is such uncertainty about how to measure those  that the uncertainty about the
inflation outlook has increased is the thing that we can read from what the markets are telling us
the assessment of risk in paragraph 4 where it mentions not only the policy actions but also the
measures to foster the liquidity is valuable so that people see that these are complementary tools
and that we understand how they can work together  the mention of price stability at the end
and how that differs from our statement from last time is a good way to signal that  but i really
dont see evidence yet that we have lost credibility  if we look back historically at when weve
done ratecutting in either financially stressed times or actual economic downturns at least over
the past twentyfive years it has not turned into inflationary challenges and i dont see any
evidence that the markets think otherwise  so i support alternative a as is  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  obviously we are facing a very difficult
policy problem and that is why charlie we will go have a beer later so that we can deal with
our depression
mr plosser  how about two
mr mishkin  yes maybe two  clearly we are challenged by the fact that we have to
balance the risks of both underlying inflation and inflation expectations going up  against that
we have to worry about the downside risks to the economy and the financial sector could really
go south  so that is really the policy problem that we face
i do support alternative a but i would like to give some perspective on that because i
may have a different take than others on this  if you are thinking about the riskmanagement
viewpoint that i and some others have talked about i want to emphasize that lowering the federal
funds rate 75 basis points is notand i want to repeat is nottaking out insurance  if you look
at the greenbook projections they have 75 basis points and they have a further decline after
that  the r has dropped 125 to 150well it depends on which model but quite a bit more than
75  so from an insurance perspective we should actually be doing more than 75 basis points
but i am not going to argue for that  in fact i would argue for that if some of the other things
such as negative supply shocks hadnt been happening
i also have a concern about a phenomenon that has occurred which i dont fully
understand  normally i would not worry about dollar depreciation  i gave a speech recently on
passthroughit was an opportunity for me to interact with nathans staff and to read the
literatureand the evidence is that there is just not a whole lot in terms of passthrough  but
lately we have seen something that is very peculiar which is that every time we have had
depreciation in the dollar the oil price has gone up  that makes me much more nervous about
dollar depreciation than i would usually be  i hope that it may be just coincidence but it makes
me a little more nervous
another problem that we face is that we have not convinced the markets that we will be
willing to bring out the baseball bat if inflation starts to get out of control  that is really a key
part of the riskmanagement approach and a key part ofi think vince reinhart called it post
gradualism in his speech  he gave a very interesting speech the other day and called it post
gradualism  but we have not yet convinced people about it and part of the problem is that we
really havent operated in that way in the past  this is one reason that it is worthwhile talking
about this and saying that we need to think about operating in a different way  but it suggests to
me that if we actually were more aggressive than 75 basis points it could have very negative
reactions in the markets about our commitment to controlling inflation  so that is one of the
reasons that i strongly support the chairmans proposal  i should say by the way that even so
the 75 basis point cut which i dont think takes out enough insurance does pose some risk that
longrun inflation expectations will rise  but we have to realize that there is a lot of risk of really
bad things happening that could mean that things really get out of control  the discomfort is that
we now have a tough tradeoff  but then when i think about the tradeoff i am willing to say that
we have to take the risk because otherwise the consequences could be very problematic
i should mention that i have one concern about the wording in the statement  i usually
dont make comments about the wording because i am just not subtle enough to get that  but i
did worry a bit for exactly the reason that vice chairman geithner mentioned about the issue
that talking about inflation expectations getting unhinged could be actually very dangerous  the
first sentence in alternative a says inflation has been elevated and some indicators of inflation
expectations have risen  well i worry about that  first of all the evidence is not completely
clear on that  it is true that there has been an increase and i have said it is about 10 basis points
but there is other research and there is a lot of uncertainty about these measures  i am
wondering if we put that in whether it will actually cause a problem in terms of market reaction
so it worries me a little  i would probably be more comfortable with what we have in
alternative c which is that inflation has been elevated and then the reasons for upward pressure
i am not sure that this would be helpful  i dont feel super strongly about it but the comments of
vice chairman geithner made me a bit more worried about it than i otherwise would have been
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  let me just begin with a question because i think it is
really central  it goes to the issue of how accommodative policy is now  fundamentally that
must be critical to the magnitude of the risks we are taking that we are going to get it wrong and
inflation in the future is going to be too high  now i am not really part of your profession but i
have always found this chart to be the most discouraging prism on the choices we face
chairman bernanke  what chart is that
vice chairman geithner  this is the bluebook equilibrium real funds rate chart
but any way you look at it the real fed funds rate is closer to best estimates of equilibrium than
during any downturn of the past two decades or similar periods of time  there is no gap between
the estimated real rate today and the center of the estimate of where equilibrium is  if you look
back to what that gap was in 1992 in 200102 or in 2003 there was a substantial gap as most
judgments about policy would suggest was necessary  i understand that there is a huge amount
of uncertainty about estimates of equilibrium but we cant be facing both the most serious risk
of a financial crisis and of a deep prolonged recession in 50 30 or 20 years and at the same time
the risk of having a very substantial rise in underlying inflation over the medium term  it seems
to me that we are going to have one or the other  the choice we face of course is which risk we
are prepared to take  which mistake is the easier to correct for  it is a very hard judgment to
make
but i think we have to be confident that if we end up being successful in averting the risk
of a very very dangerous damaging spiral in the financial markets with the consequences of a
very deep recession or a deeper recession than in the early 1990s then we will be able to deal
with the likely consequences that we will have more inflation and less moderation than we now
anticipate  i guess i dont understand why we would not be confident in that  so let me just say
that i dont think this is easy  like many of you i think that it would be great if we got away
with 50 but i think that is not tenablenot even close in this context
even though it would be nice if we had a consensus in the united states about a set of
fiscal measures that we think would be good on the merits we cant make monetary policy in a
framework where we condition our actions on actions by the congress  in an environment like
this it is not possible  if we do the right thing does that mean it takes the pressure off them
maybe but probably not so much  but it cant constrain us from doing what is appropriate now
just one final thing  people who know this stuff quite well who are reasonably calm
people say this is possibly the worst financial crisis in 50 years and the most challenging set
of pressures facing the central bank in 20 or 30 years  think about that in this context  okay
it is no surprise that we disagree it is no surprise that the range of agreement about what we see
and what we should do is going to be wide in that context  but just think very carefully about
the signal it sends to the world at this moment to be explicit in public about the degree of
dispersion about our views  just think carefully about it because this is a special moment
i fully support the language and the action in alternative a  president fisher i would not
amend the last sentence to say without sacrificing partly because i think we need to project
confidence in our capacity to manage longterm inflation outcomes  i am ambivalent as you
know mr chairman about that clause that president fisher suggested we delete about reflecting
a projected leveling out  the virtue is that it explains and underpins therefore the basis for a
mediumterm forecast  the vice in it is that as the chairman himself said the first part may
seem like a thin reed on which to base our forecast given what has been happening  i actually
think governor mishkin that acknowledging some indicators of inflation expectationsit is
really about uncertainty having increasedis helpful to our credibility  at the margin it helps
even though sure you can say that we really cant know what they are telling us about the
market
mr mishkin  may i just ask a question back  i do think that inflation expectations
are a concern  it is just a question of how the marketsand i am not as good at this as the
people who really follow the marketsand the press will react to this phrase because i think that
the amount of movement here is still very small  you know the kinds of numbers we are talking
about for inflation expectations are on the order of 10 to 20 basis points  will this mention
because it is new raise a flag that will get more attention and more concern than in fact is
justified  that is the tricky problem here  we should acknowledge it but again i am not good
enough at wordsmithing to figure out how to do that  this is a bit of my concern here  i dont
know if anybody has any thoughts about how to handle it
chairman bernanke  president fisher i think i agree on the last sentence  i
would like to keep it something that we have used frequently before and that emphasizes in fact
the symmetry of the dual mandate  are there other thoughts on either the indicators of inflation
expectations or the list of reasons that anyone would prefer to change from where we are
mr kohn  on inflation expectations because they havent risen very much i agree
with president geithner  i like the fact that we tell people we are aware but we could say have
edged higher or something like that instead of risen
mr mishkin  we could use my smidgen word but edged higher is better
mr kohn  went up a smidge
chairman bernanke  all right  president evans
mr evans edged higher is an unusual phrase
mr mishkin  have risen somewhat
mr madigan  i think an issue with edged higher is that it really does sound as
though you have some very specific measures in mind
chairman bernanke  brian do you have a thought on risen versus risen
somewhat versus taking it out
mr madigan  i think if you take it out that very much raises the question of what to
do with that language in red about the factors that would push inflation down  it would be tough
to drop the inflation expectations thought and not have inflation expectations mentioned
anywhere in the paragraph  there would just be vacant space where you had at least in previous
minutes referred to it
chairman bernanke  anyone else  bill
mr dudley  adding just the word slightlyrisen slightlygets to your point
mr mishkin  slightly or somewhat risen
mr warsh  brian does somewhat mitigate it a little or does that highlight it
mr madigan  im not sure  i mean in my mind it mitigates it
vice chairman geithner  somewhat
mr kroszner  is slightly better than somewhat
mr kohn  somewhat is bigger than slightly
mr evans  that is 50 versus 25 in the old days
mr lockhart  mr chairman if i understand the discussion about this when you
say some indicators have risen somewhat you are getting into territory that seems sort of
mealymouthed
chairman bernanke  right
mr kohn  risen a little
mr kroszner  what is wrong with slightly
chairman bernanke  all right  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i dont want to prolong this too much but in response to
the vice chairmans comments i am not sure i follow what you are saying  i think the model
that you showed us in terms of where the equilibrium rate is is a shortterm model  it is based
upon a variety of estimates and output gaps and i think there is plenty of room for disagreement
around that model  so the fact that we have different views on this committee is very healthy
even to the world it can be very healthy because a lot of people out there have a different view of
this and are wondering if there is any variance of views within this committee  i think that can
serve as useful a purpose as uniformity without objection
vice chairman geithner  let me say for the record that i agree with everything
you just said  my only point is that there is no surprise that we disagree or that it is complicated
and we have a different view of the balance  if anything what this chart shows is how broad the
range of uncertainty is around this  that was part of my point in saying it  but i do think that
the value of the public display of dispersion is different when you have this degree of a
confidence problem in markets generally  that is the only thing i was suggesting  i completely
agree about the value of diversity of view in this context  it is no surprise that we disagree in this
period  my only suggestion is in terms of how we think about talking about it publicly given
that we are at such a delicate moment
mr hoenig  vice chairman we have a bubble developing in some parts of our area
i think they are aware of that and so i think we have to be mindful of that in our discussion more
broadly  that is why i think there are important differences that we should necessarily be able
toand should in factacknowledge publicly
chairman bernanke  okay  having thought about this i think that some
indicators does tone it down a bit  perhaps we could just leave it where it is  who knows what
reaction this will get  again there is some sense here of trying to ratchet up at least our verbal
attention to inflation  let me say to everyone that i went through each of these alternatives and
tried to find one that didnt make me intensely uncomfortableand i am still going through
them  these are very very difficult decisions  we are all people working in good faith and we
are all doing the best we can  i appreciate the candor and the honest comments and we will
continue to work together and to address these very very difficult issues that we have  if you are
ready then perhaps we could take a vote
ms danker  the vote will encompass the directive ill read from the bluebook and
the statement for  alternative a in the chart that you have in front of you
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun
objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent
with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent
