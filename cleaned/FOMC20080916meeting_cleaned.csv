transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on september 16 2008
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  sorry for the late beginning
the markets are continuing to experience very significant stresses this morning and there are
increasing concerns about the insurance company aig  that is the reason that vice chairman
geithner is not attending and chris cumming will sit in his place
i want to turn in a minute to bill dudley for his usual report and he will be able to give
you more information about the situation  there is another action item i would like to add given
what is happening which is that there are very significant problems with dollar funding in other
jurisdictionsin europe and elsewhere  after bill makes his presentation and we have our
discussion i would like to put on the table a request for authorization for swap lines  i prefer not
to put a limit on it so i know ive got my own bazooka here  laughter  there is a foreign
currency subcommittee that consists of myself the vice chairman of the fomc and the vice
chairman of the board  again after bills discussion i would like to discuss the possibility of
giving us a temporary authority to use swap lines as needed
before i turn to bill let me say one other thing  obviously we started late  we have a
lot to talk about  i would likejust for today if you would indulge meto condense our
discussion to one round  in your discussion please include your tentative views on the policy
decision  obviously that is not ideal because you will not have heard everyone elses views but
we will have an opportunity afterward for people to amend revise and give additional thoughts
but in the interest of time i think it would be more efficient at this time just to do it that way
without further ado let me turn to bill and ask for a report
mr dudley  thank you mr chairman  i am not going to go through this in great detail  you can look at these charts at your leisure1  i am going to focus on

1  the materials to which mr dudley refers are appended to this transcript appendix 1
what is going on right now how we have responded to it and what i think the issues are  just to give you a snapshot of what has happened since sunday evening stocks are down worldwide4 percent plus everywhere  yesterday the us stock market was down about 4 percent and sp futures indicate a lower opening today  as you might expect there has been a big flight to quality especially into the treasury bill market  tenyear treasury note yields fell about 30 basis points yesterday and there has been a big rally throughout the treasury curve  the big thing where there has probably been the most severe stress in the market is in dollar liquidity for foreign banks  as you remember foreign banks especially in europe have a structural dollar funding shortfall and they look to execute foreign exchange swaps or borrow in the dollar libor market to fund that  there was significant upward pressure in that marketovernight libor rates today were 644 percentand that pressure in europe is leaking over into our market  yesterday the federal funds rate opened at
3 to 3 percent  despite our doing a 20 billion repo at our normal 930 am time the upward pressure on the funds rate yesterday continued  it rose to as high as
6 percent in the late morning and that is why we came in with a second operation of
50 billion around noon yesterday
to try to have more effect on this issue this morning we came in much earlier than we normally doaround 800 am  we did a 50 billion overnight repo  the funds rate at the time was trading at 3 percent  i think this means that we are obviously adding way too many reserves for the current maintenance period but the good news is that when this maintenance period is over a week from tomorrow we get a fresh start  so at the current time i think we will see essentially a lot of firmness in the funds rate in the morning and then the funds rate trading down to zero late in the day  where the funds rate averages relative to the target is going to be somewhat difficult to say  yesterday despite the collapse in the funds rate to essentially zero at the end of the day the funds rate was quite firm relative to the target  i dont remember the numbers but it was in the 2 percent range  we are going to try to hit the target on average but it is going to be very difficult  in the current circumstances it probably is more sensibleat least my advice would beto err on the side of providing enough liquidity to the market rather than trying to be cute and worrying just about the target federal funds rate
now the lehman filing has also intensified the pressure on morgan stanley and goldman sachs in a number of respects  the lehman failure means that investors now view the debt of morgan stanley and goldman sachs as having much more risk than it did on sunday  this means that these firms need bigger liquidity buffers than they had before and it does have implications for longterm profitability  as a consequence their share prices fell very sharply yesterday  morgan stanley was down about 5 a share to 32 and goldman sachss stock was off 18 points to
135  morgan stanley experienced a modest but not insignificant pulling back of their counterparties and ate into their liquidity buffer by a measurable degree  the lehman problems also were evident in some other areas  this is very incomplete but the ones that came to my attention were money market fundsespecially the reserve fund that had large withdrawals and they encountered a significant liquidity
problem  i am actually not sure how that was resolved but i think that state street was in the situation of having to cover a very large shortfall of the reserve fund last night  the risk here of course is that if aig were to fail money funds have even a broader exposure to them than to lehman and so breaking the buck on the money market funds is a real risk  the capital resources of the entities that are associated with the money market funds often are quite modest so their ability to top up the money funds and keep them whole is quite limited  thus the money market funds are definitely one important issue in how this contagion could be broader
the second issue is the people who are dealing with lehman and who have positions with lehman as their counterparty and how they wind up those positions as you know the parent filed for bankruptcy but the us brokerdealer is still in operation  but being in operation doesnt mean that they are necessarily conducting business in a normal way  one issue that has received a lot of attention is from some of the asset managers on their mortgage tba positions with lehman  apparently the sell side can net these up pretty easily through the ficc fixed income clearing corporation but the asset managers have positions with lehman to either take on mortgagebacked securities or to sell mortgagebacked securities on a forward basis and they are not really sure what those positions are going to be when we get to that date  lehman was not executing those trades yesterday and so these asset managers are in the very unfortunate position of not knowing what to do  do they offset their lehman position with a trade elsewhere or not  so that has been another very open ended issue for the market  in terms of market function yesterday it was manageable in the sense that markets did trade  but i think it is much too soon to think that we are going to make it through just based on yesterdays move because that move even though it wasnt particularly severe in terms of for example the share price movement did cause quite a bit of damage and people are still pulling away
of course we also have the issue of aig  the aig problem is at least starting as a liquidity crisis  the problem with aig is that the parent company doesnt have a lot of liquidity resources and doesnt have easy ability to funnel liquidity up from their subsidiaries because most of the subsidiaries are regulated entities  so aig is running into two problems  one they are unable to roll their commercial paper and two as their ratings are downgradedthey were downgraded by moodys yesterday i think from aa minus to a minus but dont quote me on thatthey have to post a lot more collateral against their derivatives exposures and also with respect to their gic guaranteed investment contract business  so aig is in a situation in which the parent is basically going to run out of moneytoday tomorrow thursday or very very soon  now we say its a liquidity thing but a lot of times when people look closer at the books they find out that the liquidity crisis may also be a solvency issue i think it is still a little unclear whether aigs problems are confined just to liquidity it also may be an issue of how much this company is really worth
finally let me talk a bit about the facilities that we introduced over the weekend
basically we did two things  we broadened the primary dealer credit facility pdcf significantly in terms of collateral eligibility  whereas before the pdcf
took investmentgrade securities only we broadened it to include basically everything that is in the triparty repo system  we felt that by backstopping the triparty repo system completely we would reassure triparty investors that they didnt face rollover risk and so we would keep triparty investors investing with the banks  that seems to be mostly what happened at least yesterday  we did get quite a bit of pdcf borrowing yesterday evening but it was predominantly lehman  it was about 28 billion of lehman borrowing  i think the total borrowing was something on the order of 42 billion  that is telling you that most of the borrowing we had was associated with lehmans not being able to roll over their triparty repo positions with their investors  we dont really know the reasons for the other borrowing but it probably was mostly to test the facility as opposed to actual need  so broadening the pdcf collateral eligibility does seem to be working so far at least in keeping triparty investors in the game and continuing to provide funds to the other primary dealers
the second thing we did was to the term securities lending facility tslf  in terms of the collateral requirements that had been aaarated rmbs cmbs and assetbacked securities  we broadened that collateral so the terms are now the same as the old primary dealer credit facility  we think that there is quite a bit of collateral that the primary dealers have in those aa a and bbb classes of asset backed securities cmbs and rmbs  so we think that is going to provide more support to the primary dealers in terms of funding their liquid collateral in this environment  we also increased the size  the original authorization was for 200 billion  our auction schedule had been 175 billion and we put that 25 billion increase into schedule 2  remember there are schedules 1 and 2  schedule 1 is treasuries and agencies  schedule 2 is treasuries agencies and this other stuff  so the schedule 2 auctions are going to go up in size and we frontloaded that increase because the tslf has not been fully subscribed  we are actually going to be able to do two tslf schedule 2 auctions this week of 35 billion so we are going to get quite a bit of tslf liquidity into the market this week which we think will also be helpful
so that is where things stand  otherwise i think things in the market are doing what you would expect  there is a flight to quality  the japanese yen and the swiss franc are outperforming  the dollar is sort of in the middle and the highyielding currencies continue to be under pressure  but that is just what we have seen for the last year underlying these risk trades  i have a lot more material so if you ask questions i can get into that  but i think i will just leave it there
chairman bernanke  questions for bill  president rosengren
mr rosengren  just an amplification on the state street situation  my
understanding is that no money actually went out  there was 20 billion in withdrawals that
came in late in the day  they had a 7 billion credit line  state street had enough collateral to
do 7 billion  they were unwilling to do 20 billion  they asked us what our position was
and we told them that they needed to make their own business decision in this case  i havent
heard what has happened this morning  i assume that they are scrambling for funds  but i would
emphasize that a real concern is that there will be a run this week on money market funds
because they may have to freeze the funds  it is possible that they will break the buck and this
will be at organizations that dont have sufficient capital to make people whole  so i think that is
a real concern
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just a question on the pdcf about the expansion of the collateral base
you said there was 42 billion 28 billion of it was lehman  do we know what kind of
collateral lehman posted  did they actually make use of the expanded options or not  what
was the nature of it do you know
mr dudley  that was not actually even known until late yesterday evening  it takes
a while for us to get the reports from the clearing bank to be able to go through and tell you what
the collateral is  in terms of the lehman collateral they are not allowed to broaden the pdcf
they are basically bringing us the stuff they had on friday  it is also important to recognize that
for lehman we are demanding a lot higher collateral requirements on the nontreasury and non
agency securities  their collateral haircut for those is 20 percent  so the fed is taking some
credit exposure there but we put in place on fridayand we are continuing thata 20 percent
collateral haircut on the nontreasury and nonagency stuff that is in the pdcf for that exposure
to lehman  we think thats about roughly three times the market level that investors had been
charging previously so i think that gives us a fair degree of protection
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the higher collateral requirement is that
just lehman
mr dudley  at this time i believe that is right
mr lacker  okay  i know there was a lot of concern going in yesterday about the
triparty repo market and i envisioned two scenarios and anything in between them  one is tri
party lenders pulling away from particular names and moving their funds to other names
another at the other extreme would be triparty repo lenders pulling away from the market as a
whole  if you look at the triparty repo market from the point of view of the borrowers that is a
frightening scenario  then the lenders are going to do something with that money  i have been
curious about what they would do  my understanding is that cash balances in essentially deposit
accounts piled up at state street and bony yesterday and that they were able to do triparty
repos with some institutions that had been pulled away from  is that a valid observation  what
are the prospects for that providing some kind of resilience for the triparty market
mr dudley  well i guess the first thing i would say is that you are absolutely right
if investors pull away they have to take their money somewhere  it doesnt disappear  i think
that the primary dealer credit facility has been shown to be pretty significant in providing
support to this market  if you look at what happened to lehman for example even though
lehman was under extreme pressure on friday the triparty repo investors stayed with lehman
on friday night which actually surprised me  i think the reason that they stayed is that they
knew they didnt really have a lot of rollover risk  as long as the brokerdealer didnt file for
bankruptcy over the weekendand that was the risk they really were takingthe federal
reserve and the pdcf would be there as the triparty repo investor of last resort  lehmans
experience suggests to me that if we can contain the broad parameters of this crisis so that it
doesnt spread much further then we can keep the triparty repo investors from bolting because
they dont really have a huge amount of risk as long as we are there behind them to take them out
when their overnight obligation comes due the next day
mr lacker  so if i can just follow up my understanding is that triparty repos are
exempt from the automatic stay so it is not filing per se that is the risk  its the risk that they
dont have the cash right
mr dudley  well im not sure about that  i thought that there was an issue about
brokerdealer filing  i know that the clearing banks are certainly quite nervous about that
eventuality but im not a lawyer
mr parkinson  the repos are exempt from the automatic stay provisions of the
bankruptcy code  but if lehman had gone into sipa liquidation they could have been subject to
a sipa stay
mr lacker  all right  then a question about the tslf  is it this program in which
we provide treasuries
mr dudley  we give them treasuries and they give us other stuff  you know this
will also probably be helpful this week in providing more treasuries to the market  there was a
tremendous amount of treasury fails yesterday  so this mechanism does two things  it takes
illiquid collateral from the dealers and it also supplies a lot of treasuries to the market which
should help improve the market function in treasuries
chairman bernanke  other questions  bill would you be able to talk a bit about
the need for swaps
mr dudley  i have just sketchy details based on a phone call so this may not be
quite right  but my understanding is that this morning norway put in place a facility by which
they are going to offer their banks dollars up to 5 billion on a oneweek termsort of an open
facility  the fact that norway is doing this suggests that the situation has broadened quite a bit
further because this is the first time that we have heard about norway in this story except for
maybe some exposures to the icelandic banks
i have had some conversations with my counterparts at the ecb this morningthis is at
a staff level so i cant really say what would happen if you were to take this up the chain of
command  but certainly at least on a preliminary basis there is quite a bit of interest in having a
similar facility for the ecb which would not be a taf loan type of facility but more of an open
facility where european banks could come and get dollars  this would reassure people that
dollar liquidity was available in europe throughout the european day  my advice to you is that
this is probably a good idea in this environment because we are seeing that the lack of dollar
liquidity in europe is really having a feedback effect on peoples willingness to do business with
one other in the broader markets  i think we should be open to doing this with the ecb and
perhaps with the bank of england and the bank of japan as wellat least have the ability to do
it should it prove necessary
chairman bernanke  you had a twohander governor kohn
mr kohn  just to note that we did have a discussion of foreign exchange swaps in the
committee on the global financial system a week and a half ago and the general consensus was
that these had been very handy in damping pressures in money marketsdollar funding markets
in particularwhen the foreign exchange swap market isnt working very well in europe and in
switzerland  the central banks around the table which are all the major central banks are quite
supportive of expanding the facility  we were talking about putting something on a standby
basis for use in situations just like this  so the other central banks view this as very helpful to
them in containing pressures in their own markets
mr dudley  the bank of japan has requested at the staff level to set up a facility that
would be on the shelf for yearend because the japanese are quite worried that their banks are
going to face a dollar funding problem at yearend  now this preceded the recent crisis so even
before this last week they were concerned that the japanese banks could potentially have
problems and they were interested in exploring with us having a facility in place  we were
actually going to pursue this and i hope we will have more at the october fomc meeting if not
sooner
chairman bernanke  bill if we were going to take action today what would you
recommend in terms of counterparties  should we say an unlimited amount  should we specify
an amount  can we leave the time open  what are your recommendations on all those
dimensions
mr dudley  certainly you want to make it pretty broad  you want to make it to the
bank of england switzerland the ecb the bank of japan potentially canada  i would leave it
to their discretion if they would like to participate  i would make the offer to them and if they
want to participate then we should be willing to do that  in terms of size i think it is really
important that you dont create notions of capacity limits because the market then can always try
to test those  either the numbers have to be very very large or it should be open ended  i would
suggest that open ended is better because then you really do provide a backstop for the entire
market  as weve seen with the pdcf if you provide a suitably broad backstop oftentimes you
dont even actually need to use it to any great degree  so i think that should be the strategy here
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  remind me again how big the european system of central banks own
outright holdings of dollar balances are
mr dudley  european banks
mr lacker  yes
mr dudley  i dont know
mr lacker  central banks
mr dudley  do you mean in terms of their dollar foreign exchange reserves
mr lacker  right  the ecbthey all have their own dollar reserves
mr dudley  i dont have the numbers
mr sheets  i believe that number is about 180 billion of dollar reserves in the euro
system  the ecb itself has control of only a fraction of that
mr lacker  these are held at individual national central banks so our swap lines to
them arent approaching that level yet right
mr dudley  no
mr lacker  note here a sense of discomfort with our lending them dollars that they
already have and so our serving as a substitute for their mobilizing their own dollar reserves for
this purpose  obviously the demand could swamp their own reserves and at that point i would
feel differently about this  but my understanding is that the distribution within the european
system of central banks is uneven and in some sense this just provides them with a way to
circumvent negotiating how those dollars would be distributed from different central banks to
different privatesector banks within their own system  broadly im uncomfortable with our
playing that role
chairman bernanke  whether its sensible or not the ecb has made a pretty
strong distinction with us between their foreign exchange reserves and their dollars that they use
in these operations  they really want to keep those segregated  they want to some extent to
represent this as being a collaborative effort with the united states as opposed to something they
are taking on their own behalf  from their perspectiveactually president poole raised the same
issue earlier on and we had this discussionthey seem to put a lot of value on having a distinct
swap line which symbolizes the cooperation and coordination of the two central banks as
opposed simply to using their own reserves  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i was going to say that we had this discussion before  we
did approve the swap lines  i wonder if you could just summarize for us what you view as the
downside risk to our doing this
chairman bernanke  well i dont think there are any significant downside risks
there are operational issues that bill dudley and his team have to worry about  if we extend
funds to the europeans which they then relay to their banks it affects our reserve positions and
affects the management of the federal funds rate and requires sterilization  thats an operational
issue  i suppose if there were really very large draws it would begin to affect some of these
balance sheet constraint concerns that we have  i think that is not an entirely separate issue but
it is certainly one that we are looking at in terms of trying to get interest on reserves and those
other kinds of measures
again my expectation is that having the facility would in part provide some confidence
over and above how much we actually extend  so i guess the operational issues and the further
draw on the balance sheet would be the downside but to me it seems to be a relatively
straightforward stepone weve done in the past and one that has the additional benefit of
indicating global cooperation on these issues
mr dudley  in principle we could talk to the ecb and other central banks about
having the rate on these swap lines be at a slight penalty relative to normal times to try to
mitigate the potential reserve impact  i mean it doesnt have to be at 2 percent or 2 percent for
overnight fundsit could be somewhat north of that  but if we have a credible backstop then it
should calm the markets and then the backstop should not be used  if we have a backstop and it
actually is used that is presumably because market conditions are horrific  so in that
environment you could argue that the reservemanagement things are very second order
concerns in some sense
chairman bernanke  other comments  all right  then id like to propose that
the fomc delegate to the foreign currency subcommittee an unspecified authority in terms of
amount to offer swaps to foreign central banks as needed to address liquidity pressures in those
other jurisdictions  those decisions will be made again by the foreign currency subcommittee
in consultation with the open market desk  we would keep the fomc closely informed and
we would revisit and discuss this issue again in october  is that an acceptable resolution  any
amendments to that  further discussion comments or concerns  president stern
mr stern  yes  i am in favor of this  i just wonder how the marketplace will look at
the openended nature of this because typically we have dollar magnitudes associated with
swaps  it may all go relatively smoothly on the other hand it may raise questions about exactly
what we think the issues are here
mr dudley  well i think we are going to have discussions with our foreign
counterparts to decide what the right strategy is  i think right now it is better to have it open
ended
mr stern  thats fine
chairman bernanke  why dont we have discussions with our counterparties
we wont announce anything today i would assume
mr dudley  no i think they have to take it up the chain of command just as we do
here  so its going to take probably a day
mr kohn  this would come out in the minutes for this meeting
chairman bernanke  right  well announce something
mr stern  but i assume there will be an announcement at some point
chairman bernanke  of course  when would we announce this measure
mr dudley  i think it would be after weve had a chancei mean i think we have a
lot of work to do with our foreign counterparties  this was basically raised to me this morning
chairman bernanke  all right  so this is all conditional on agreements and
discussions with other counterparties  we will come up with a joint communication
announcement strategy  president plosser
mr plosser  i just have one clarification  i have no basic objection to this  i wonder
whether or not if the fomc is going to delegate the decision to this group it is sort of an open
ended delegation to do this on an ongoing basis  does it make sense to define a period of time
for which this openended delegation is appropriatethat it would expire and would have to be
renewed
mr dudley  yes  we have authorities extending right now to january 30 for a lot of
these facilities so that would certainly be a reasonable time frame i think
chairman bernanke  existing facilities go to january 31 is that right
mr madigan  january 30
chairman bernanke  january 30  would that be acceptable
mr plosser  yes  i think it ought to have a termination point so that if we wanted to
renew it we would be free to do so but it wouldnt last forever
chairman bernanke  of course
mr kohn  one more clarification mr chairmanthis is intended for g10 central
banks to include the ecb  just to be clear if somebody asks this is not to give to central banks
of emergingmarket economies
mr dudley  i presume so
mr kohn  i think we should presume so  if the other were to happen we would come
back to the committee
mr dudley  yes this is about the major financial centers and the ability of large
banks that operate globally to obtain dollar funding
chairman bernanke  okay  so i amend the proposal to terminate on january 30
president lacker
mr lacker  could i hear a little more about the benefits of an openended
commitment  all of our programs have been capped at a certain size  you said something about
test the limits and it makes me think of foreign exchange regimes  what kind of scenario do you
have in mind
mr dudley  i think a lot of the programs that we have are actually open ended  the
discount window is open ended in the sense that its limited only by the amount of collateral that the
banks post there  the primary dealer credit facility is open ended in that it is limited only by the
size of the triparty repo system  my point here is that if foreign banks worry about capacity limits
even having a large program could in principle not be sufficient in extremis  but if the program is
open ended the rollover risk problem goes away  if i lend you more dollars today i dont have to
worry about getting those dollars back because i always know that the facility is there  so its really
the elimination of the ability to flatten out your position if you need to in terms of your dollar
exposures
chairman bernanke  its not open ended in the sense that it is not an open window
that anybody can come to and take  it just gives us the authority to adjust the amount
mr lacker  so you will set a definite amount
chairman bernanke  we will certainly negotiate with the other central banks and
tell them what were doing now  but we want to have the flexibility in case of an emergency to
respond and we also dont want to communicate to the markets somehow that we have a hard limit
that is not going to be changed  that would be potentially bad for confidence
mr lacker  but we will communicate a program size
mr dudley  i think that remains to be discussed with our counterparties  i think we
need to have discussions about what would be most effective  would a big size thats fixed in
quantity be most effective  would an open limit be most effective  i think we have to have those
discussions  i think the important thing hereand what were going foris credibility  in a crisis
you need enough forcemore force than the market thinks is necessary to solve the problemand
were going to have to have discussions to determine how much is enough force
chairman bernanke  i think it is mostly a communication issue  anything else
all right  do you want to call the roll on this one
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  we need a second
mr fisher  second
chairman bernanke  all right  thank you
mr plosser  can we read the resolution
chairman bernanke  the resolution is to provide to the foreign currency
subcommittee the authority to enter into swap agreements with the foreign central banks as needed
to address strains in money markets in other jurisdictions  this will be done in cooperation with the
open market desk and in consultation with those other central banks  the amounts are unlimited
in principle but the decisions will be made by the foreign currency subcommittee as needed and
as appropriate for the particular circumstances  the fomc is providing this authority through
january 30  it will of course be open to discussion at any meeting
mr plosser  as actions are taken presumably youll circulate the outcomes of these
decisions to this committee in advance of any announcements
chairman bernanke  of course  all right  lets take a vote

chairman bernanke  any objections  okay  thank you  lets turn now to the
economic situation  dave stockton and nathan sheets
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  in response to your request for some economy in our remarks this morning im going to set aside my prepared remarks and just hit some of the highlights here  we did receive a great deal of macroeconomic data since we closed the greenbook last wednesday  we didnt seem to get any of it right but it all netted out to just about nothing  laughter  retail sales came in considerably weaker than we had anticipated enough by themselves to have knocked about  percentage point off thirdquarter gdp growth  but some of that was offset in higher retail inventories and the rest was offset by a strongerthanexpected merchandise trade report for july  it all left us still feeling very comfortable with our forecast because it looks to us as though economic growth is going to drop below
1 percent on average in the second half of the year
in terms of the things that really have stood out over the intermeeting period at least to my mind one has been the weakness in consumption  as i indicated the retail sales report was weak and now with that report in hand wed probably mark down our currentquarter consumption forecast to a decline of 1 percent at an annual rate  what i think is really remarkable about that is that this weakness is occurring even though we still think spending is probably receiving some boost from the rebates  so excluding that effect wed be looking at something even weaker  now as you know weve been headfaked a number of times by the retail sales data which are subject to some pretty substantial revisions  so i wouldnt necessarily take that report at face value  but the drop weve seen in motor vehicle purchases pretty much mirrors in size and timing the kind of falloff that weve seen in overall consumption spending  so it looks like a very weak picture for consumption
the other notable development over the intermeeting period has been the weakness in the labor marketsnow not principally in the payroll employment figures  private payroll employment has been falling pretty sharply but not any faster than we would
have thought  but the rise in the unemployment rate is remarkable  now some of the
04 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate last month could be statistical noise  it wouldnt be entirely surprising to see it fall back some  but the more than 1 percentage point rise that weve had since april is not going to be statistical noise some of that increase probably reflects a bigger response to the emergency unemployment compensation program than we previously thought and weve upped our estimates for that to a little less than 03 percentage point on the level of the
unemployment rate  but even putting that aside we have experienced a more significant rise in the unemployment rate and i think thats consistent with other things that were seeing in terms of the labor market data  weve seen another appreciable jump in initial claims  announced job cuts are up  job openings are down  survey hiring plans have softened
now this sharp rise in the unemployment rate is a bit difficult to square with a gdp figure that looks as though it was running above 3 percent in the second quarter and  even 2 percent if you want to average the first and second quarters together  there are occasionally large errors in okuns law as i think ive noted in the past  it seems as though okuns law gets obeyed about as frequently as the 55 mile an hour speed limit  on i95  laughter  but still one of the things that we should probably be considering is that perhaps the economy has not been as strong as suggested by the real gdp figures real gross domestic income which is output measured on the income side of the accounts has risen about 2 percentage points less than gdp over the past year  and if we look at industrial production and compare that with the components of gdp that are in essence goods production theres about a 1 percentage point discrepancy there with industrial production suggesting weaker figures than gdp
we see no reason to discount the rise in the unemployment rate as suggesting that were entering the second half with more labor market slack than we had previously thought  furthermore on net weve revised down our projected growth in gdp over the next two yearsadmittedly just a bitand that was in response to two pretty strong crosscurrents  one was the significantly lower oil prices that we have in this forecast we do think theyre going to provide some support to underlying disposable income and spending  but the positive effect of that on our forecast going forward was more than offset by a significant marking down in our forecast for net exportswhich nathan will be discussingin response to an appreciation of the dollar and a further downward revision to our outlook for foreign activity  on net that left us with a little lower growth rate and carrying forward a noticeably higher unemployment rate over the forecast period  now those were pretty small adjustments  i dont think weve seen a significant change in the basic outlook and certainly the story behind our forecast is very similar to the one that we had last time which is that were still expecting a very gradual pickup in gdp growth over the next year and a little more rapid pickup in 2010
the three things that are absolutely central to producing that outcome are our projection that were going to get a stabilization in housing in 2009and early in 2009 that there will be some diminishment of the drag on growth from the financial turbulence and that oil prices flatten out  of those three to my mind the component
that probably is most central and most important would be seeing some stabilization in the housing market not only because this has been a big drag on growth and will also have consequences for household wealth but also because if theres going to be some clarity and reassurance to financial market participants it seems as though some end to the housing debacle has to be in sight  we think we are seeing a few glimmers of hope therehowever we thought that on occasion in the past and have been proven wrong but sales of existing homes have been flat since the turn of the year  sales of new  homes have been flat for several months now  weve had a drop in mortgage interest rates that followed the takeover of fannie and freddie  starts have fallen so much now that in fact builders are making significant progress in working down the inventory of unsold new homes and even months supply has tipped down of late  so we think that some things are looking a little better for us there  as a consequence were expecting to see some bottomingout near the end of this year or the beginning of next yearbut not a sharp recovery  overall residential investment actually is still a negative for 2009 but less of a negative than it has been this year  as you know from the greenbook our estimates suggest that the financial restraints on overall activityactually on the level of gdpwill increase between 2008 and 2009 but their effects on the growth rate of gdp are diminishing somewhat  finally with regard to oil prices by our assessment the rise in crude oil prices since the beginning of 2006 is probably knocking about  percentage point off growth in 2008 and with a flattening out of oil prices we expect that to be more of a neutral factor over the next two years  thats providing some impetus  a lot of whats going on in our forecast is bad things not worsening any more quickly next year than they did this year rather than things actually getting better  i guess its a sad comment that were relying on second derivatives turning positive to be the main force generating some upward impetus to economic growth  but we are projecting a gradual pickup
now on the inflation side this mornings cpi report for august actually came in a little better than we were expecting  the cpi in august fell 01 percent  we had been expecting an increase of 01 percent  that surprise was all in the energy component but we at least did see some moderation in the retail food price side that we were looking for and the change in core cpi fell back to 02 percent after a string of 03 percent increases  i dont think these data will do much to change our basic forecast which is for total pce prices to be up somewhere in the neighborhood of a 5 percent rate in the third quarter and core prices up 3 percent  still if one looks back at the last few cpis and pces things have come in a little higher on the core side  the projected 3 percent increase is up about  percentage point from where we were in our august forecast and our interpretation of this is that were probably seeing more upward impetus and pass through from the higher energy prices other commodity prices and imports than we had previously expected  that certainly squares with what were hearing from our business contacts  it also squares with what we saw last week in the ppi which was another very sharp increase in prices of intermediate materials  at least going forward for the first time since this process got under way we are seeing more than just a futures price forecast flattening out  some easing in the prices of both oil and other commodities and the appreciation of the dollar are giving us at least a little more confidence that some of these cost pressures are going to abate going forward and that we will get the disinflation
that we have been forecasting  we continue to see reasonably encouraging signs on inflation expectations  the mediumterm and longterm inflation expectations in the preliminary michigan report last week dropped 03 percentage point to 29 percent tips havent really done very much and hourly labor compensation continues to come in below our expectations  so based on our assessment once these cost pressures work their way through the systemand we still think that the process will take place over the second halfwe think that well get some receding of core inflation from the 24  percent that were projecting for this year to 21 percent next year and 19 percent in 2010
just a couple of final remarks on current events  hurricanes gustav and ike obviously created an enormous amount of devastation for a whole lot of people but they dont really appear to us to have significant macroeconomic consequences  there will be some temporary disruption to oil and gas extraction and refining but it looks as though the basic infrastructure has largely been spared  ill be interested to hear president fishers report  retail gasoline prices have jumped in the last few days but wholesale prices for delivery in october are actually lower than they were before the storms were on the horizon  i think that suggests that this is not going to be a major negative event  undoubtedly industrial production is going to fall like a stone in september reflecting these two hurricanes as well as the boeing strike but were expecting that to bounce right back again  i dont really have anything useful to say about the economic consequences of the financial developments of the past few days  i must say im not feeling very well about it at the present but im not sure whether that reflects rational economic analysis or the fact that ive had too many meals out of the vending machines downstairs in the last few days  laughter  but in any event were obviously going to need to wait a bit to see how the dust settles here but i think the sign would be obviously in a bad direction  ill turn over the floor to nathan
mr sheets  i also will be very brief in summarizing economic developments abroad  indeed i would just like to make six very brief points  the first one is that the incoming data weve received since the last greenbook for the foreign economies have been extraordinarily soft  indeed weve marked down our forecast or projection of the second quarter by a full percentage point  the data also suggest that we should carry forward a fair amount of that softness at least through the next year  so our foreign outlook is much softer than it was before
the second point is that this softening outlook in our view has been a key factor that has contributed to further sizable declines in oil and commodity prices  this morning oil prices were trading around 92 a barrel which was down another 25 a barrel from where we were at the time of the last meeting
the third point is that this deteriorating foreign outlook also seems to have triggered something of a reassessment in currency markets  since your last meeting the dollar has strengthened nearly 5 percent in broad nominal terms  in our view what happened in currency markets was that the markets had priced in the expectation that the foreign economies would remain quite resilient in the face of a slowing in the united states
now with the incoming data over the past couple of months it is becoming clearer and clearer that the us slowing is going to have a marked effect on these foreign economies and this has shifted the relative attractiveness of the dollar and supported the appreciation that weve seen over the last couple of months
the fourth point is that in a number of emerging market economies weve seen a resurgence of certain sorts of financial vulnerabilities  weve seen across really a broad array of these economies rising external debt spreads and rising cds spreads  weve seen falling equity prices and for a number of these economies downward pressures on their currencies  on that last point a number of the asians have been intervening in the foreign exchange market over the intermeeting period but have actually been intervening to try to prevent their currencies from depreciating which is a marked change from what weve seen in the last couple of years
the fifth point is that the surprisingly strong performance of us exports that weve seen appears to have continued through july  after the greenbook went to bed we got the july trade data and they continue to point to a fair amount of strength in the export sector  it was particularly strong in the auto sector but it was a broadbased strength through july  nevertheless our view is that given the rise in the dollar and the softening outlook for foreign growth were very likely to see some slowing in export growth going forward
the final point id like to mention is that also late last week after the greenbook went to bed we received data on import prices  these data really for the first time in a long time showed a marked deceleration in both materialintensive goods import prices and finished goods import prices  our forecast for a long time has called for a deceleration in import prices in line with the projected flattening out of commodity prices and a projected flattening out of the dollar
now it seems that were at a point at which all those things that have been incorporated into our forecast but we havent had a lot of evidence for are starting to materialize  we have the dollar flattened out and indeed somewhat stronger than in the last greenbook  we have lower paths for commodity prices and then the data that we recently received showed an actual deceleration in core import prices which gives us some confidence that perhaps the rise in those import prices has peaked  ill stop there
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for dave and nathan
mr fisher  could i ask just one question mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  could you interpret for us the bank of chinas cut in the bank lending rate
mr sheets  yes  yesterday the pboc cut its main policy rate 27 basis points  i guess
they felt that 26 would not have been enough and 28 would have been too much  laughter  and
27 was just the right number  id say a couple of thoughts were there  one important point is that
inflation in china has decelerated significantly  in the spring they were looking at twelvemonth
inflation rates of around 83 percent  the latest reading for august was 49 percent  so its clearly
on a decelerating trajectory  that has been driven by a marked decline in food prices  earlier this
year food prices were moving up at over a 20 percent rate and now it is about 10 percent  so the
deceleration in prices some concerns about where activity is going particularly in the aftermath of
the olympics and signs of slowing external demand have given them the scope they need to cut
policy rates  besides the cut in monetary policy were also hearing reports that the authorities are
poised to implement fiscal stimulus if thats necessary
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  three is a lucky number in china  don was going to tell you
that 3 cubed is 27  laughter
mr kohn  he was also going to wonder mr chairman whether we needed to harness
the mystical powers  laughter
chairman bernanke  i think we have good feng shui here
mr sheets  the science of monetary policy
chairman bernanke  any other deep questions for our colleagues  im a little
surprised
mr plosser  were all trying to be brief mr chairman
chairman bernanke  everyone has been very brief  im shocked  laughter  my
proposal which i can be argued out of is to do one round if thats acceptable  please indicate your
preliminary view on policy and you will have another opportunity to refine and extend your views
is that acceptable with everybody
mr kroszner  should we have brians presentation
chairman bernanke  yes of course  i was about to turn to that  if thats
acceptable lets turn to brian and have your discussion
mr madigan2  i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives and trial run survey results the results of the survey are shown in exhibit 2  in the interest of time i will not cover them this morning  the subcommittee on communications plans to be in touch with the committee on this issue over the upcoming intermeeting period
the first page of the package reproduces the version of table 1 that you received yesterday afternoon  this version includes three policy alternatives  as in the bluebook alternative b would leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and alternative c would involve a 25 basis point firming today  however alternative a now entails a 25 basis point policy easing rather than the unchanged funds rate that was specified in the bluebook version of this alternative
i will begin by discussing alternative c  the discussion at your last meeting suggested that you generally saw the next move in policy as likely to be a firming a point that was explicit in the minutes of the meeting  even though market volatility and financial strains have increased notably in recent weeks you might view those developments as having only limited implications for the economic outlook and hence see economic fundamentals as continuing to suggest that policy should soon be firmed  inflation has been well above the rates that committee members judge as appropriate for the longer run and despite lower oil prices and greater slack in labor markets there remains considerable uncertainty about how soon and how much core inflation will slow  in these circumstances you may believe that a firming of policy is appropriate
under the version of alternative b distributed yesterday evening the committee would hold the target funds rate constant at this meeting and the statement would suggest that the committee sees the risks to growth and inflation as roughly balanced you may believe that this combination is appropriate for this meeting if your modal outlook for the economy has not changed much since the last meeting and if you judge that the upside risks to inflation have diminished given the sharp drop in energy prices the decline in indicators of inflation expectations and the greater economic slack implied by the recent unexpectedly sharp jump in the unemployment rate  you might also believe that the downside risks to growth have increased as a result of the recent increase in financial strains  but at the same time you may want

2  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
to let the dust settle a bit before concluding that these developments warrant an adjustment in your policy stance  in particular you may think there is a good chance that the latest enhancements to the federal reserves special liquidity facilities will help keep markets functioning and mitigate the risks to growth
relative to the bluebook version the language of alternative b has been revised in three material ways  first b2 now notes that strains in financial markets have intensified  second the clause some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated has been dropped from b3 in view of the recent declines in inflation compensation and survey measures of inflation expectations  finally the first sentence of b4 has been revised to suggest that the committee now sees the significant risks to growth and inflation as roughly balanced  given market participants expectation that the funds rate could trade soft to the target for a time in light of recent developments gauging exactly what is built into markets for the outcome of todays meeting is difficult  but earlier this morning market prices appeared to incorporate high odds of at least a 25 basis point easing today or possibly more  thus markets might well see a decision to keep the funds rate constant and to make no appreciable change to the language of the statement as signaling less concern about financial developments than they anticipated
if you saw recent developments as significantly boosting the downside risks to growth or noticeably lowering the modal outlook you might consider easing the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting as in alternative a  the rationale language for this action would begin by noting that strains in financial markets have increased significantly and would go on to indicate that the policy action should help to promote moderate growth over time  the committee would cite the recent decline in energy and other commodity prices and the increased slack in resource utilization as factors that are expected to foster a moderation of inflation  the risk assessment would indicate that the downside risks to growth have intensified but the upside risks to inflation remain a concern to the committee  with a policy easing largely built into markets shorterterm interest rates would likely decline modestly in response to such an action depending on how much is built in or they might be little changed  as the chairman indicated earlier in the meeting adjustments to the statement could be considered in light of the further volatility in markets over the past day  thank you mr chairman
mr dudley  if i could add a few thoughts on market expectations about this meetingi
think it looks as though easing is priced in for two reasons  one dealers do expect the federal funds
rate to trade soft as we add excess reserves so i would not take the softness in the september federal
funds futures contract as indicative of necessarily expecting an easing  two i think it is important
to recognize that the rates embodied in those fed fund futures contracts are means not modes  so i
would characterize the market expectation as either that things get very very bad and the fomc
cuts rates significantly or that the fomc does nothing
i think that actually a 25 basis point cut is probably the least likely outcome that the market
anticipates  as evidence of this a couple of dealers yesterday did change their forecast to a 50 basis
point rate cut  im not aware of anybody who has changed to 25  probably people like that are out
there  i know that my colleagues at goldman sachs where i used to work are saying that they
think the fomc is going to keep rates unchanged today but if they were to move it would be 50
that gives you a sense that its really a bimodal kind of view and that putting different probabilities
on 50 and zero gives you some easing priced into the federal funds rate futures market  so i think
the consensus view still in the marketplace is that the fed probably will not cut rates today  that
would be a disappointment to a degree because theres some probability placed on the idea that the
fed might do 50 but thats how i would interpret whats priced into the markets today
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  could i ask for a little clarification here  the indication of sentiment is
important is it not in terms of expectations from the population that youre talking about  the
signaling of our direction would be important here
mr dudley  well i think the market participants would gain some comfort to the
extent that the federal reserve as an institution indicates concern about whats going on in the
financial markets  but in some ways the desk has already signaled that concern by its intervention
so im not sure that additional indications are needed  but in the language you might want to
indicate to market participants that if things were to materially worsen in the financial markets the
committee might revisit the issue of where the federal funds rate should be
chairman bernanke  just on the issue of trading soft though the october
december has also come down and there is certainly some shift in the actual policy expectation
mr dudley  that is true  i think on friday the mood was basically that the funds rate
was going to be flat for a long time  probabilities placed on either easing or tightening were quite
low and since then the probability of easing has gone up fairly significantly  but i think its hard to
interpret because its really not about 25 versus zero  its really about zero versus 50 or maybe even
100 as you look out longer term  either the financial system is going to implode in a major way
which will lead to a significant further easing or it is not
chairman bernanke  other questions  all right  if not lets begin with president
lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i finalized the thinking that went into my
prepared remarks late last week which seemed like a good idea at the time  but i should follow
the philosophy of charlie brown who i think said never do today what you can put off until
tomorrow  laughter  obviously we cant ignore the events of the weekend and yesterdays
financial markets  so late yesterday i reviewed the views that i shaped last week and tried to
ground them in an assessment of whether the outlook for the real economy has changed
materially whether the balance of risks has been altered and whether in my opinion we must
reintroduce a riskmanagement approach and consider taking out more insurance
with that as prologue let me make just a couple of comments on regional soundings
from the last couple of weeks  anecdotal reports from the sixth district support the view that
the economy is quite weak but not deteriorating markedly  the cfo of a large retailer of
housingrelated goods said that they think they see a bottom forming  i am also starting to hear
some reports that housing markets feel as though they are beginning to stabilize but really it is
a little too early to say that a bottom has formed in any of our housing markets  my overall sense
from district contacts and our surveys is of an economy that is quite weak with no clear trend
evident
turning to the national outlook like most forecasts my view on the likely path for the
economy has not changed materially since our august meeting  i see nothing in the data and
hear nothing from district reports that alters my views that the second half will be very weak  i
expect this weak period to be followed by a slow recovery gathering in 2009 but the foundation
of a recovery starting around yearend or early 2009 may be far from solid  the contraction of
credit availability that is confirmed by both surveys and anecdotal evidence could deepen as
financial institutions face tight liquidity and difficulty recapitalizing  a protracted credit crunch
would likely operate as a substantial drag on the economy
consistent with the greenbook i expect some nearterm improvement in headline
inflation as we saw this morning some nearterm deterioration of core inflation measures and
inflation moving in the right direction later this year and into next year  that said one director
said that he and his particular industry had seen no moderation of price increases up to this date
i am comforted somewhat that the upward drift in some inflation expectation measures appears
to have been reversed  in addition my staff has been monitoring revisions to inflation forecasts
of professional forecasters which also seem to suggest that concerns about accelerating inflation
have abated somewhat
regarding the balance of risks in the economy i am concerned that the downside risks to
growth may be gathering force as evidenced by the weakening personal consumption and retail
sales data the weakening economies of export partners and the delicate state of the financial
markets  at the same time i perceive that there is significant risk that the current disinflationary
environment may fail to bring core inflation down to anything resembling acceptable levels for
the longer term  adding up all of this i perceive a very rough balance of risks that could break
either way in coming months
my view of the appropriate policy path is consistent with the greenbookthat the fed
funds rate target will remain stable at or close to the current level for several months going into
2009  my preference is to hold the fed funds rate at the current level of 2 percent  among the
reasons is that a  percentage point drop as suggested by alternative a is really not clearly
called for by a changed outlook for the real economy  inflation risks are still in play and i think
we should give credit markets more time to digest events and sort out rate relationships
as regards the statement my preference is alternative b  however i am concerned that
the reference to the recent financial turbulence is not quite strong enough so i took a shot at
rephrasing just the beginning of the rationale section to read as such  economic growth appears
to have slowed recently and labor markets have weakened further  in addition strains in
financial markets have increased significantlybasically taking the slightly stronger expression
in the alternative a rationale and putting it in alternative b  so my position mr chairman is to
hold at this meeting  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i will be brief  this is already a
historic week and the week has just begun  the labor market is weak and getting weaker  the
unemployment rate has risen 11 percentage points since april and is likely to rise further  i am
not convinced that the unemployment rate will level off where the greenbook is assuming
currently  the failure of a major investment bank the forced merger of another the largest thrift
and insurer teetering and the failure of freddie and fannie are likely to have a significant impact
on the real economy  individuals and firms will become risk averse with reluctance to consume
or to invest  even if firms were inclined to invest credit spreads are rising and the cost and
availability of financing is becoming more difficult  many securitization vehicles are frozen
the degree of financial distress has risen markedly  deleveraging is likely to occur with a
vengeance as firms seek to survive this period of significant upheaval  given that many
borrowers will face higher interest rates as a result of financial problems we can help offset this
additional drag by reducing the federal funds rate  i support alternative a to reduce the fed funds
rate 25 basis points  thank you
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i see no reason to focus on the details of the forecast
clearly the economy is under stress both as we look at the economic growth forecast and as we
look at the inflation forecast  so i recognize the amount of stress we are under here  i would say
to you in dealing with that stress i am fully supportive of the actions that we take in terms of
liquiditythe taf and the other efforts to provide liquidity into the market  these are tools that
we can and should use for these kinds of shocks in a shortterm context  on the other hand i
would encourage the committee to resist the impulse to ease policy in a sense of doing
something  the issue is not the level of our policy rate at this time  it is the dysfunctioning of
the markets that we hope our liquidity efforts will help address  to begin to talk about easing or
even to put language in there that suggests easing is to cause people on the expectation that we
might ease at some point even if we hold off now to delay decisions that they would otherwise
make that would benefit the economy
i also encourage us to look beyond the immediate crisis which i recognize is serious
but as pointed out here we also have an inflation issue  our core inflation is still above where it
should be  headline inflation has been up even though there are some signs that commodities
and energy are backing off  but the businesses themselves are saying how do i recover my
margin  so there is no impulse to pass along those reductions  we talk about wages and labor
backing off  but they are holding off they are not backing off and in negotiations they are
much more antagonistic  those kinds of pressures will emerge at some point  those are the
longerrun issues that i think we need to keep in mind as we deal with this immediate crisis  so i
would strongly encourage us to leave rates where they are to be very careful with our language
not to encourage the expectation of further rate decreases and to continue to be aggressive in our
liquidity provisions as we have been the last several weeks and months  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  during the past several weeks my head
office and branch directors have become decidedly more pessimistic about the economic
outlook  my own assessment of incoming data coincides with theirs  my contacts also report
that their businesses are still raising prices in response to past increases in commodity and import
prices that boosted their costs  i expect as a consequence that core inflation will remain
uncomfortably high for a while longer but the marked decline in commodity prices since june
reinforces my conviction that there is light at the end of this inflation tunnel
with respect to growth our forecast is similar to the greenbooks with a little more
weakness in the second half of this year and a little more strength in 2009  i think the risks to
this forecast are decidedly skewed to the downside  i agree with the greenbooks assessment
that the strength we saw in the upwardly revised real gdp growth in the second quarter will not
hold up  despite the tax rebates real personal consumption expenditures declined in both june
and july and retail sales were down in august  my contacts report that cutbacks in spending are
widespread especially for discretionary items  for example east bay plastic surgeons and
dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures  laughter  reservations are no
longer necessary at many highend restaurants  and the silicon valley country club with a
250000 entrance fee and seventoeightyear waiting list has seen the number of wouldbe new
members shrink to a mere thirteen  laughter
exports were a huge source of strength in the second quarter but i am concerned that we
cannot count on very large contributions to growth from exports going forward now that the
dollar has begun to rise and economic growth abroad has slowed even turning negative in some
important trade partners  indeed the growing weakness of the global outlook appears to be an
important explanation for the reversion in commodity prices and this adds a dimension of gloom
to what would otherwise be a decided plus for both inflation and demand
recent data also suggest that labor markets are weakening across the boarda
development that will cast a pall on household income and spending  the interaction of higher
unemployment with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for even worse
newsnamely an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we have long worried about and
are now experiencing  indeed delinquencies have risen substantially across the spectrum of
consumer loans and credit availability continues to decline  one ray of hope is that the changes
at fannie and freddie have caused a notable drop in mortgage rates  another is that the decline
in home prices has become somewhat less steep and we have seen an outright improvement in
home inventories relative to sales  but my contacts are very pessimistic about the prospects for
nonresidential construction  they note that construction is continuing on projects in the pipeline
with committed funding but new projects are all but impossible to finance
turning to inflation i have long anticipated and still expect that inflation will fall to
morereasonable levels in 2009  however developments since our august meeting diminish the
upside risks to this projection  the drop in oil and other commodity prices along with the
appreciation of the dollar should work to moderate the current inflation bulge and diminish the
potential for a wageprice spiral to develop  import inflation has already begun to ease
furthermore we have seen a remarkable decline in inflation compensation for the next five years
in the tips market  i would not rely heavily on this decline to support my view but i do have to
say that the decline is a lot more reassuring than the alternative  i was also encouraged by the
30 basis point drop in longterm inflation expectations in the most recent michigan survey  i
anticipate that the recent jump in the unemployment rate will place some additional downward
pressure on growth in labor compensation which has been quite low and in core inflation
although the jump in the unemployment rate probably partly reflects the extension of
unemployment insurance coverage a backoftheenvelope calculation suggests that the upper
bound on this effect is just a few tenths of a percent  i would agree with the greenbook
estimates  we have also examined the possibility that the increase in unemployment reflects a
rise in the nairu due to sectoral employment shifts out of construction and finance and into
other industries  ned phelps has argued that the sectoral shift story implies a sizable dispersion
of employment growth across industries and states  but we looked at these data and found no
significant increase so i dont find this phelps argument particularly convincing  considering
all of these factors i expect both headline and core pce price inflation to fall to about 2 percent
for 2009 as a whole and i see the risks to this projection as roughly balanced
with respect to policy i would be inclined to keep the funds rate target at 2 percent
today  for now it seems to me that the additional liquidity measures that have been put in place
are an appropriate response to the turmoil  i am fine with the wording of alternative b and
would support president lockharts suggestion for change  that would seem fine to me too  in
view of the intensified financial stress and the potential for more turmoil obviously i think we
will need to be flexible in setting policy going forward and i am very concerned about downside
risks to the real economy and think that inflation risk is diminished
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i am going to start with the national
economy in the interest of brevity here  concerning the national outlook it is difficult and
probably unwise to try to assess growth and inflation prospects in the immediate aftermath of an
event like the lehman bankruptcy  i expect to see more failures among financial firms and i
expect those failures to continue to contribute to market volatility  this is part of an ongoing
shakeout among financial market firms following some of the worst risk management in a
generation  i expect sluggish growth in the second half of 2008 in part due to labor markets that
are somewhat weaker than expected  financial market turmoil is certainly a key concern but the
us economy still outperformed expectations in the first half of 2008 despite the demise of bear
stearnsan event not too different in some respects from the current episode
my sense is that three large uncertainties looming over the economy have now been
resolvedthe gses and the fates of lehman and merrill lynch  of these the resolution of gse
uncertainty seems to be the most pivotal even though it is not the one leading the news today
normally the elimination of key uncertainties is a plus for the economy  as is typical in this
type of situation safe interest rates have fallen dramatically across the board
a second macroeconomic shock stemming from the dramatic rise in oil and other
commodities prices has been an unwelcome development during the past six months  the retreat
of west texas intermediate prices to 94 a barrel and today down to 92 a barrel should
improve secondhalf growth prospects
meanwhile an inflation problem is brewing  the headline cpi inflation rate the one
consumers actually face is about 6 percent yeartodate  that does not include todays report
this is against the federal funds target of 2 percent  while it makes sense to focus on financial
markets for the time being it is essential that we keep in position to put downward pressure on
inflation going forward  the financial crisis threatens to roll on for such a long time and to
demand so much attention that the private sector may rationally conclude that we have lost all
sight of our inflation objective  in such a case of unmoored expectations outcomes could be far
more severe than those envisioned in the greenbook
my policy preference is to maintain the federal funds rate target at the current level and to
wait for some time to assess the impact of the lehman bankruptcy filing if any on the national
economy  in uncertain circumstances like these i think it would be unwise to react too hastily to
a fluid situation  any immediate effects may not be the ones that are intended and further down
the linethat is once more data have accumulateda hasty action may leave the committee out
of position relative to the incoming data  by denying funding to lehman suitors the fed has
begun to reestablish the idea that markets should not expect help at each difficult juncture
changing rates today would confuse that important signal and take out much of the positive part
out of the previous decision  in addition a rate move would be poorly targeted toward
mitigation of difficulties at particular financial firms  the fomc has already done a great deal
to create a low interest rate environment in order to shepherd the economy through a substantial
shock to the financial and housing sectors  the committee now needs to allow the financial
sector shakeout to occur using liquidity facilities to the extent possible to help navigate the
resulting turbulence  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  new data and survey and anecdotal
information in the third district suggest that the economy in our district continues to be weak
there have been further declines in some industries and deceleration of growth in others but
generally data are coming in as expected  employment growth was flat over the threemonth
period ending in july and i expect that unemployment rates in our three states will tick up in
august when the regional data come out much as it did in the national data
overall the activity in our region as i said has remained weak since the last meeting
housing construction continues to be weak  sales of existing homes remain sluggish and
inventories remain high  one builder said things dont feel very good  i feel as though i am in
a tar pit  my feet are maybe now on the bottom my nose is still above the level of the tar and
while i may feel the bottom it still doesnt feel very good  on the commercial real estate side
we saw a slight uptick in the value of july contracts but they are not very high  in fact they
really remained at the average level of the last seven years  retailers remain pessimistic in the
latest beige book  district banks saw loans rise slowly but steadily in august  the beige book
reports from them see slight gains in consumer and real estate lending and ci loans essentially
flat
the good news is from our business outlook survey for september which will be
released to the public on thursday at 1000 am but the results are in  the survey is from the
first two weeks of september  the general activity index has been negative if you recall for the
last nine monthssince december 2007  the last value was minus 127  the september
number not to be released until thursday is a positive 34 so thats a swing of 15 points to the
good  this is clearly somewhat encouraging although we dont want to get too excited about
one monthbut it is good news  furthermore both the new orders and shipment indexes in the
survey improved in september  price pressures have abated somewhat with the fall in
commodities and oil but they remain  the sixmonthahead outlook indexes also improved
substantially in the new survey  this is the best picture that the survey has painted in certainly
quite a whileabout the last six or eight months  in summary the economic conditions of the
third district remain weak and sluggish but are not materially different from what we and our
business contacts had been expecting over the near term
while a lot of attention in the short run is being paid to financial markets turmoil our
decision today must look beyond todays financial markets to the real economy and its prospects
in the future  in this regard things have not changed very much at least not yet  indeed the
greenbook forecast has changed only modestly since the last greenbook  the economy remains
weak but not appreciably different from what i anticipated or even what the greenbook
anticipated at the last meeting  i agree that the recent financial turmoil may ultimately affect the
outlook in a significant way but that is far from obvious at this point  we also need to
acknowledge the long lag times associated with the effect of monetary policy actions on the real
economy  actions today will not help us very much in the very very near term where the real
economy is concerned
on the inflation front there has been some good news  the decline in the retail price of
gas has contributed to a decline in headline inflation in august  in my view the price declines in
commodities and oil have mitigated somewhat the upward pressure on expectations and have
reduced the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored at least in the near
term  nevertheless i remain concerned about the inflation outlook going forward  in part my
concern stems from the fact that i do not see that the ongoing expected slowdown in economic
activity is entirely demand driven  as i noted before the impact of financial shocks and high
commodity prices can plausibly lead to a decline in the growth rate of potential output  if so
there will be less offset to inflation going forward than incorporated in the baseline greenbook
forecast which relies heavily on slack variables to control inflation  the greenbook simulation
entitled costly reallocation provides some welcome effort from the staff in this regard and i
appreciate that  yet the details of that experiment were a bit sketchy for me and at some point i
would be interested in a little more detail as to how that actually plays out
in my view the main driver for the outlook of future inflation over the next two years is
not nor has it been oil prices per se but the path of monetary policy that the committee will
adopt over the next several months and quarters  i appreciate the memo that the staff produced
regarding the stance of monetary policy  according to the memo the current stance of policy is
not unusually accommodative  however i would like to note that that conclusion depends
critically on the specific forecast and the nature of the frbus model  a different model one
that says that inflation expectations are more forward looking may well lead to a very different
conclusion  but i take the message of the memo to be that the assessment of the stance of
monetary policy is dependent at a point in time on a model and i very much agree with that
assessment  given that my model is somewhat different from the staffs model i continue to
believe that monetary policy at its current level is accommodative and that if this current stance
is sustained the economy will experience faster inflation in the medium term  clearly we must
pay attention to the adverse effects of the financial disruptions  but we also must recognize that
our policy actions today and over the next several months will affect the outcomes of inflation
over the medium term  as i said it is my view that the current stance of policy is inconsistent
with price stability in the intermediate term and so rates ultimately will have to rise
now i acknowledge that there are risks to economic growth going forward  the
slowdown and the financial market turmoil could turn out to be worse than i expect  i also
recognize that given the events over the weekend now is probably not the time to shock markets
by raising rates  but neither is it a time to panic and lower rates  a cut today may be reassuring
to some in the financial markets but it also may serve to scare markets by sending a signal that
we are much more worried than perhaps they are  there is just way too much volatility and dust
blowing around to make such snap judgments on monetary policy  we have been aggressive
with our liquidity provisions and we will continue to be so and i support that  stability coming
from monetary policy is an important attribute and i think we have an opportunity to provide
some stability here  however i am uncomfortable with the current greenbook baseline path that
has the funds rate remaining unchanged well into the second half of next year  in my view that
will not deliver an acceptable path of inflation outcome over the medium term  at the same
time i do not perceive an immediate threat to the unanchoring of expectations so i can accept
keeping the funds rate at an unchanged level at this meeting  but at some point before the
unemployment rate begins to improve substantially i believe this committee will need to raise
rates in order to deliver on our inflation objectives
regarding language i can live with the language in alternative b  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well even before the events of the last several
days i thought that this was the most severe financial crisis certainly that i have seen in my
career  and the last several daysas well as some of bills comments about possible contagion
spreading from breaking the buck and so on and so forthhave only heightened that conviction
and my concern about where we are  so i think it is fair to say that the headwinds confronting
the economy have intensified even further  it is difficult to comment on the degree or the
duration but i think we know the direction  as far as the nearterm economic outlook is
concerned i wasnt terribly optimistic about the next two or three quarters to begin with  if i
were going to prepare a new forecast at this pointor even had i prepared one last weeki
probably would mark it down a bit  but of course there is not much we can do about that at this
stage
as far as the inflation outlook is concerned i have thought that late in this year and into
next year inflation would start to abate and recent developments perhaps heighten my
conviction about that  but i will agree that it is still an open issue  so it seems to me that all of
this suggests that the outlook at least in terms of financial conditions and the economy in the
near term has clearly deteriorated  the inflation outlook if anything has perhaps improved a
notch or at least the outlook that i had earlier is a little more solid
given the lags in policy it doesnt seem that there is a heck of a lot we can do about
current circumstances and we have already tried to address the financial turmoil  so i would
favor alternative b as a policy matter  as far as language is concerned with regard to b i would
be inclined to give more prominence to financial issues  i think you could do that maybe by
reversing the first two sentences in paragraph 2  you would have to change the transitions of
course
i would say that if we wanted to change policy at this meetingand that is not my
preferencei would do it by  percentage point and i would think that the rationale would be
psychological reasons  again i dont think we are going to have a big effect on the nearterm
performance of the economy  but if we think psychology in the marketplace is sufficiently bad
or that there is sufficient concern that the federal reserve somehow doesnt quite get iti
would think that all our actions cumulatively including the actions over the weekend should not
make that a grave concernthen i think we would want to do more than  percentage point
thank you
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  the unfolding financial situation is injecting
enormous uncertainty into the economic outlook and policy picture  although this analogy is
imperfect todays uncertainty reminds me of march 2003  then on the eve of the invasion of iraq
the fomc decided that geopolitical uncertainty was so great that the committee could not
characterize the balance of risks at all in the policy statement  today the downside risks to output
are almost too dispersed to characterize  in one or two weeks we may know better that either the
economy will somehow muddle through or were likely to be facing the mother of all credit
crunches  i think that the first outcome would be quite an accomplishment under the circumstances
but at the moment its very hard to say how this will turn out
nevertheless we have to offer an opinion  with respect to the economic landscape before
the developments of last weekend one thing that i kept hearing was that uncertainty and caution in
the business community had increased in recent weeks and that they were causing many firms to
hold back on spending and committing to financial investments  but a number of my contacts
indicated that the weakness was not out of line with their earlier expectations  on the plus side i
got the impression that with the exception of housing there are not many excesses on the real side
of the economy that needed to be worked off  notably i did not hear of inventory overhangs or
unused capacity and manpower even indicated that their clients had been careful not to go
overboard earlier in the hiring cycle and so were not left with bloated workforces  still this
sentiment and the incoming data did not paint a pleasant picture with regard to the national outlook
as one of my directors said turning the common phrase against me the economic problems that we
are facing appear to be remarkably resilient  even before last weekends events the economic risks
had increased somewhat  we had the large rise in the unemployment rate the recent weak
consumption data and heightened caution by firms  now of course the financial risks have
increased substantially and further threaten the growth outlook  at a minimum credit standards are
likely to tighten further and crimp spending
im not looking forward to putting a forecast together in october  dave and the board staff
have my sympathy and respect for doing this each meeting  its unfortunate dave that we havent
had the time to spend talking about the excellent special memo that you and your staff put together
on gauging the effective stance of policy  i thought that was very helpful  i had on previous
occasions mentioned that it would be nice to have some markers that we could look at and at least
for me that was quite helpful  now its not a large stretch to expect that inflationary pressures will
recede given what were facing  we could see enough weakening in the economic outlook that the
projected slack in the economy will point inflation more clearly down and below 2 percent over the
medium term  just last week i was still a bit skeptical that these forces would be large enough to
achieve this disinflation  but we need to be forward looking and that would be how i would mark
my inflation forecast down today
so what does this mean for policy today  i favor alternative b  in my view weve kept the
policy rate low so that we would not be far from appropriate policies if and when the risks to growth
intensified enough relative to the risks to inflation  so we are well positioned to act if we need to  i
agree with president stern that if we were to act we should do something significant on the order
of 50 basis points  but i think we should be seen as making wellcalculated moves with the funds
rate and the current uncertainty is so large that i dont feel as though we have enough information
to make such calculations today  we will know much more in a couple of weeks i hope at least
about the changes in underlying financial conditions and will thus have a better sense of the risks to
both elements of the dual mandate and the associated policy actions  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the recent financial market news is shaking
peoples confidence dramatically  but even before recent events the evidence was already pointing
to more effects of the financial crisis on the real economy than i had built into my projection at our
last meeting  the reports from my district contacts and the incoming data caused me to revise
down my nearterm output projection even before the latest round of financial market troubles  the
improvement in net exports that was reflected in the secondquarter gdp growth has not
encouraged manufacturers in my district to revise up their export projections  they are still holding
firmly to the opinion that the global economy is slowing and that export growth will slow with it for
several quarters  of course manufacturers are concerned about weakness spreading further within
their domestic customer base
the ongoing turmoil in financial markets continues to affect businesses in my district
some of the banks in my district are finding it very very difficult to attract new capital and to
manage their way out of trouble  i am hearing that credit is harder to come by for many borrowers
who in the recent past would not have thought twice about their creditworthiness  last week i met
with a business contact with a very long and successful track record of buying and operating private
companies  he reported that he had reached a deal with a bank to finance a project at a 7 percent
interest rate with the loan amortized over a fifteenyear term  on the morning of the close just three
days later the bank faxed him the paperwork which reflected a 12 percent interest rate on a non
amortizing loan with a 10year term  so the deal obviously is not going forward  one of my
directors who heads a very large regional banking organization reported at our board meeting last
week that many banks are shedding assets and that in some cases they are walking away from
longstanding customer relationships in order to do so  he said that investors are very skeptical
about putting new equity into banking deals and that those who have done so in the past vow not to
be burned twice let alone a third time
of course inflation remains an important issue as well  my contacts as dave mentioned in
his report are not so confident that a broad array of intermediate and retail prices are actually going
to move back down as a result of the recent decline in energy and other commodity prices  several
of my contacts report that major suppliers are trying to maintain their prices despite the decline in
raw material costs just to make up for a long period of absorbing price increases  nevertheless
most of my contacts agree that the commodity price environment has stabilized considerably
making me more confident that core inflation will gradually slow over the next couple of years
at our last meeting my forecast was broadly consistent with the greenbook baseline
today my forecasts for output and prices are broadly similar to the greenbooks for 2009 and 2010
although i am expecting more weakness in economic activity in the second half of this year than the
greenbook is forecasting  my contacts in the manufacturing sector have persuaded me that exports
are going to be weaker in the short term than i had previously thought and i have also revised down
my consumption path on the basis of the credit constraints on households  although i am more
encouraged about the recent decline in energy and commodity prices i would like to see further
evidence of price stability in these markets and also continued stability in inflation expectations for
a while longer before i reduce the upside risk that i place on my inflation outlook  however a
growing risk to my outlook is that the shortterm weakness that i have now built into my outlook
extends further out into the forecast period  i worry that my outlook doesnt fully capture all of the
many ways in which financial forces at work in the economy are actually going to restrain spending
on friday i was convinced that the best course of action was to keep an even keel in these
rough seasto be flexible of course but to look beyond the latest wave crashing over the bow
only six weeks ago inflation risks were on the verge of being unacceptable and today the troubles
of wall street are the focus  i was sure that we were going to be in for many more surprises i just
didnt know when and from where they would be coming  so i supported not only keeping our
policy unchanged but also keeping our language changes to a minimum even if that language
missed some nuances of the outlook  given the events of the weekend i still think it is appropriate
for us to keep our policy rate unchanged  i would like more time to assess how the recent events are
going to affect the real economy  i have a small preference for the assessmentofrisk language
under alternative a  i think it captures my concern that the downside risks have intensified
however i can support some of the comments and changes to highlight the financial market strains
that were made by president lockhart and president stern  so i can support the language under
alternative b with some additional comments about the financial strains that we are facing  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  ill be brief  the fifth district hasnt changed
much it pretty well aligns with the national outlook  on the national outlook i find myself all
except for the policy path aligned well with the staff  there have been a lot of economic reports
since the last meeting about particular categories of spending or particular sectors of the economy
but they net out to only a small change if any in the broad contour of the outlook for me for overall
growth  i expect it to be sluggish for the remainder of the year with recovery beginning at some
point in the first half of next year  ill commit the sin of saying that uncertainty is especially high
now  there seem to be reasonably plausible risks in the outlook in virtually every spending
category and in many cases on both sides of the outlook
about inflation so far our credibility has helped to prevent a pickup in compensation
growth  in fact its heartening that compensation growth is coming in a little below expected in
response to the energy price shock this year  this has allowed us to accomplish the inevitable
decline in real wages without setting off an inflationary acceleration in wage rates  but were still in
the midst of an upsurge in core inflation which the greenbook expects is going to tick up near
3 percent this quarter  as i said before i think its critically important for us to emerge from this
episode without trend inflation ratcheting upward and im not sure we can take the forecasted
moderation for granted  inflation compensation has been well contained and that has been
heartening  but i have also said this beforei think the current level of fiveyear fiveyear
forward inflation compensation seems more consistent with a trend above 2 percent than it does
with a 2 percent trend  so im not convinced that theres going to be much gravitational pull down
from an elevated rate once core rises  at the very least i think theres some uncertainty about that
for financial markets this is yet another historic week as president rosengren remarked  i
think the questions facing financial market participants the uncertainty they face can be usefully
partitioned into three broad categories  one is the aggregate magnitude of fundamental losses that
the financial sector faces  another is the location of those losseswhere they are going to pop up
within financial intermediary sectors  the third is the likelihood and the magnitude of fiscal
transfers in the form of governmental support for particular firms  i think the weekends events
have caused financial market participants to revise their assessments of the future  it seems to me at
this early date in the process that the revision in the outlook has had more to do with the latter two
categories than with the aggregate size of fundamental losses we have coming down the pipeline
that is to say its about where theyre popping up which firms are affected and are going to be hit
and about the likelihood of government support
what we did with lehman i obviously think is good  it has had an effect on market
participants assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support and i think you would have
to attribute at least some of changes in equity prices to that  were likely to see a lot more
disruption this week and in the days going forward than weve seen so far  i dont want to be
sanguine about it but the silver lining to all the disruption thats ahead of us is that it will enhance
the credibility of any commitment that we make in the future to be willing to let an institution fail
and to risk such disruption again  on the other hand if the disruption proves less severe than we
expect the silver lining is that that will strengthen our hand in the future as well  however i would
note that i dont think that what we did with lehman has set a clear and firm boundary on the
circumstances under which government support is likely to be forthcoming  all the language
around not supporting lehman was of a oneoff nature  so im not sure about the extent to which
weve diminished uncertainty about the likelihood of support going forward and i think that such
uncertainty is likely to exacerbate financial volatility in the months ahead until we can make more
progress on articulating a reasonably principled policy on when were going to intervene and when
were not or at least enhancing clarity about that
overall i dont take whats happened in the last few days as changing much  its not
obvious to me what the implications are for the outlook for inflation and growth at least at this
point  so i dont see a reason to deflect from our policy path at this point  i can support standing
pat with the funds rate today  i think thats a good idea  i think looking forward that we will want
to raise rates sooner rather than later if core inflation doesnt moderate  i think were more likely to
require a path more like the august greenbook than the current one  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker i have a question  i really would like your
advice on this  historically if we look at situations like japan and scandinavia ultimately there
comes a point at which the banking system is decapitalized and dysfunctional and the government
intervenes on a large scale  those interventions have been very expensive but in those cases i
mentioned they have generally restored the banking system to health and have helped the economy
recover  whats your view on the right sequencing  do you think that we should remain very
tough until such time as it becomes inevitable that fiscal intervention is needed  do you think that
we should avoid fiscal intervention at all stages  im seriously interested in knowing what you or
anyone else who would like to comment think is the appropriate stage if any at which fiscal
intervention becomes necessary
mr lacker  we have a legislated program of fiscal interventiondeposit insurance
and the boundaries around that are very clear  which liabilities are insured and which ones are not
are very clear  around the edges theres some lack of clarity about what leastcost resolution means
and the extent to which deviations from that can be verified and that provides some room for the
federal deposit insurance corporation to deviate from that and implicitly to forbear to some extent
but even that is sort of a wellcontained and welldefined government support  thats what the
congress has enacted and its not clear to me whether we should go beyond that  japan got down
to deposit insurance  scandinavia did too  that seems like a natural benchmark
chairman bernanke  but i think this is a historical factthat once the banks
became decapitalized there were also capital injections into the banks in both of those cases
mr lacker  sure  those were fiscal actions
chairman bernanke  right
mr lacker  and the fdic does exactly that when it resolves a failed institution
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i have thought about this considerably because i think we
have come to a time in our history when we have institutions that clearly ought to be and may in
fact be too big to fail  i think we tend to react ad hoc during the crisis and we have no choice at this
point  but as you look at the situation we ought instead of having a decade of denying too big to
fail to acknowledge it and have a receivership and intervention program that extends some of the
concepts of the fdic but goes beyond that  that is if you are insolvent it is not a central bank
issuewe are a liquidity providerand therefore the government comes in  but unlike the gses
everyone has to take some hitthe equity holders certainly the preferred stockholders also the
subordinateddebt holders and perhaps the senior onesby assuming a certain amount of loss
they would have immediate access topick a number80 percent  the research would help us
pick that number and they can have access but the rest becomes a subordinatesubordinate position
after the liquidation so that you have still a sense of market discipline in play and you dont get the
system gaming it in that if you know theres a bailout coming you buy the debt and sell the equity
short to make a bundle  i think therein lie the distortions that are absolutely detrimental to the long
run health of the economy
regarding how we go forward i think we are going to have many lessons from this  part of
the problem has been very lax lending and obviously now weaknesses in some of the oversight
also a history of our reacting from a monetary policy point of view to ease quickly to try to take
care of the problem and therefore to create a sense in the market of our support has raised some
real moral hazard issues that we now need to begin to remedy as we look forward in dealing with
future receiverships  we are in a world of too big to fail and as things have become more
concentrated in this episode it will become even more so
chairman bernanke  i certainly agreeand the treasury secretary and i have said
publiclythat we need a strong welldefined ex ante clear regime  but we have the problem now
that we dont have such a regime and were dealing on a daily basis with these very severe
consequences  so it is a difficult problem
mr hoenig  i think what we did with lehman was the right thing because we did have a
market beginning to play the treasury and us and that has some pretty negative consequences as
well which we are now coming to grips with
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i think its too soon to know whether what we did with lehman is
right  given that the treasury didnt want to put money in what happened was that we had no
choice  but we took a calculated bet  if we have a run on the money market funds or if the
nongovernment triparty repo market shuts down that bet may not look nearly so good  i think we
did the right thing given the constraints that we had  i hope we get through this week  but i think
its far from clear and we were taking a bet and i hope in the future we dont have to be in
situations where were taking bets  it does highlight the need to look at the triparty repo market
look at the money market fund industry and look at how theyre financing  there are a lot of
lessons learned but we shouldnt be in a position where were betting the economy on one or two
institutions  that is the situation we were in last weekend  we had no choice  we did what we had
to do but i hope we will find a way to not get into this position again
chairman bernanke  okay  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman it may surprise you that president yellen and i agree
laughter at least with the recommendation as i do with the majority  i also agree firmly with
president hoenig  david wanted to know a little more about houston so i will start out with that
and then ill quickly go to the policy matter
the storm devastated galveston and beaumont  their combined population is 650000
the population of the greater houston area is 65 million  the damage to houston was moderate
the overall effect on the texas economy should be relatively mild  we still expect employment
growth this year of 1 percent or so plus or minus even though the storm really hit hard an area
that accounts for 26 percent of our employment and 30 percent of our output  in terms of the
national impact i think its important to understand that the energy infrastructure took minor losses
the shortterm functioning of that infrastructure is hampered by power losses and water problems
gasoline prices have gone up because 39 million barrels a day or roughly 22 percent of the us
refining capacity has been shut down  by the way that affects the spot marketi think thats some
of the reason youve seen this weakness recentlyand maybe the nearterm futures market  if you
look at the gasoline price market the gasoline price went up another 13 cents yesterday but the near
futures market is down 19 cents  i think it reflects expectations that once power is restored the
refineries will come back on line about a week later  so we will likely have a temporary bumpup
in inflation due to the gas prices  but i think it is important to realize that this unlike katrina didnt
shut down the mississippi and the effect on other commodity prices is likely not to be significant
with one exception  if you look youll see that prices of soybeans and soybean oil have spiked
recently  clearly the weather has an impact but i think thats more supplydemand imbalance
something that im watching carefully
the silver lining if there is a silver lining to human tragedy is probably twofold  one is if
you notice that lumber prices are actually up this year which is kind of odd in terms of lumber
trading  of course lumber producers are probably pretty happy with the devastation in our state
second mexican laborers will be very happy if we let them into the country because the hispanics
build most of our buildings in the united states  but i would say that the storm should not have any
effect on nor should it alter our preferred policy direction and i would like to talk about that very
quickly
i have been affected in my thinking about economic growth and inflation by what im
seeing overseas  im globally oriented  i do expect that were going to have less impetus from
exports which were significant in carrying our growth  our numbers show that and your numbers
david show that and all of our conversations have revolved around that  we were surprised on the
upside by it  now i think weakening economic growth elsewhere is likely to subdue that effect
we have also had an appreciation of the dollar  oil prices have declined  i dove deep in my
anecdotal explorations with the majors and also with all supply companies  for whatever its worth
they are convinced that opec now has 100 rather than 70 as their benchmark  most of them
expect prices to slide down to somewhere in the 80 range  but over the longer term whatever that
term may be were going to talk about 100plus oil  then of course many commodity prices are
off their peaks  they have retraced significantlysome entirely
that said in my anecdotal interchanges i am still hearing about the likelihood as i think
president pianalto mentioned that people are seeking to preserve their margins  theyve been
stung for many years and ill just give you one case because i think it tells us something  if you
talk to the ceo of walmart usa what they are pricing to be on their shelf six to eight months
from now has an average price increase of 10 percent  now of course you might have this
reversed as we go through time  my biggest disappointment incidentally was that the one bakery
that ive gone to for thirty years steins bakery in dallas texas the best maker of not only bagels
but also anything that has crisco in it laughter has just announced a price increase due to cost
pressures  but i do think we have a mitigation of inflation and we also have a mitigation of the
impetus to economic growth
as to the current financial predicament i want to go back to a comment i made a long time
ago  this is not the first for me  i like to tease president stern about his maturityi dont go back
to the panic of 1890 but to herstatt 1974 new york citys failure 1975 1987 and what
happened in japan  incidentally you see the same pictures repeated in every newspaper  its
always the trader holding his head or looking up at the board  now its in color it used to be black
and white  i think it comes from the same archive and it is repeated throughout time  laughter
all of that reminds meforgive me for quoting bob dylanbut money doesnt talk it
swears  when you swear you get emotional  if you blaspheme you lose control  i think the main
thing we must do in this policy decision today is not to lose control to show a steady hand  i would
recommend mr chairman that we embrace unanimouslyand i think its important for us to be
unanimous at this momentalternative b  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  coffee is ready  why dont we take
about thirty minutes  i have a couple of calls to make  see you at about 1120
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  if were ready we can reconvene  first vice president
cumming
ms cumming  thank you mr chairman  in our forecast we do show a downgrade in
real activity in the near term since the august meeting  downside risks to the economy we see as
still very considerable and i would probably say that they really have increased quite a bit  ill say
a few more words about that  ill also talk about the inflation front  we have long thought that
inflation in the medium term will moderate and weve been taking some comfort from recent
developments that have been cited already
on the weaker economic outlook we see the intensification of adverse growth coming from
many things mentioned already  the unemployment rate increase and the likelihood that consumer
spending is going to be negative  i would put great stress also on indications that world demand is
slowing abruptly as nathan mentioned  i think that all three of these things are occurring in an
environment in which we have massive correction adjustment structural change in autos housing
and financial intermediation  that adjustment is really interconnectedone has effects on the
others  as part of thisparticularly in the financial sector i would sayin our senior loan officer
survey weve seen indications that even as rates in say the mortgage markets start to ease a bit
nonprice terms may still be tightening  president pianalto talked about other areas in which
borrowers are facing much tougher terms  as financial institutions feel their capital is
constrainedand theres plenty of evidence that balance sheets are constrained across much of the
financial sectorthose kinds of nonprice rationing measures probably will become more evident
second as we discussed earlier weve seen that credit losses which thus far have been largely
confined to the financial sector and increasingly their shareholders run some risk of spilling over to
other kinds of investors who to date really have not felt that impact such as money market fund
investors as mentioned earlier  in addition the three big corrections that we have seen in autos
housing and financial intermediation are not limited to the united states  in particular as you
know several g10 countries are facing very difficult situations in their housing markets not much
different from us and the financial intermediation adjustment is truly a global correction
on the inflation side as i mentioned we have acknowledged that weve seen elevated rates
of inflation  but the recent developmentsas weve seen in inflation expectations discussed earlier
in energy and other commodity prices the unit labor cost developments that president yellen
discussed and the yearoveryear changes in import pricesare all pointing in the direction of some
moderation of inflation and moderation of inflation expectations  in particular we have looked at
inflation expectations as measured by financial markets and feel that the decline that we see in those
expectations cannot be explained simply by the drop in energy prices and technical factors but look
larger than that  we would attribute that to indications again that global demand is slowing
coming into this meeting today we favor alternative b  i would associate myself with the
comments of president stern and president evans that if we were in fact going to make a move
today it would be better to make a large move of 50 basis points  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think that even before the recent intensification
of financial market turmoil there were trends becoming increasingly evident over the summer since
late june that suggested that the economy was on a substantially slower path than it had been
before  resource utilization was falling appreciably and the expected downward path of inflation
in the future had much better odds of occurring  indeed i think that the expected weakness in the
economy and the financial markets are interacting  we have one of these feedback loops in play
there has been a lot of concern not only in the united states but in other countries as well as i
heard in basel last weekend about a spilloverthat the problems were not confined to the
mortgage markets but were spilling into the loan books of the banks  that was related to the
weakening in economic activity and was tightening up credit conditions which would in turn
further weaken economic activity  so this feedback loop was at work certainly in the united states
and was beginning to be felt a little more in other countries as well
since late june we have come to know a couple of things a little better  one is that
consumption is not immune to soft labor markets increases in energy prices declining housing
wealth and tighter borrowing conditions  even if we cant parse out the effects of each of these
factors consumption has weakened substantially  we have had three months in a row of declines in
the retail control component and very weak auto sales  although recent declines in oil prices will
support disposable incomes and consumption i think the other sources of restraint on households
declining house prices and tighter credit conditionsare more likely to intensify than to abate in
coming quarters
another thing we know is that businesses have not gotten ahead of their need to shed labor
and they continue to trim staff in response to actual and expected weakness in demand  the decline
in employment shows no signs of abating  initial claims are running more than 50000 higher than
they were at the end of june and they have remained elevated past the time that the introduction of
the temporary extended benefits should have been felt  the unemployment rate is already
 percentage point higher than anyone around this table predicted for the end of the year  the
household survey along with national income statistics could be signaling greater softness in
activity and higher output gaps than is evident in the gdp and spending data
another thing we have learned as nathan emphasized is that foreign economies have not
decoupled from the united states and their prospects have been revised down substantially
theyre absorbing the effects of weaker us domestic demand on their exports and growing risk
aversion in financial markets is spreading abroad  the latter the growing risk aversion is
beginning to have as chris cumming was noting effects on a number of emergingmarket
economies where capital inflows show signs of abating or even reversing and indicators of
financial stress have risen as a consequence of all this  because of the stronger dollar we will be
able to rely less on exports going forward than we did before
we never expected a rapid return to more normal financial market functioning but the
adjustment in the financial sector now looks to be more severe and to take longer than we thought
before  financial firms need to bolster profits to offset losses and track capital  they need to de
lever by reducing debt relative to equity  they need to consolidate and above all they need to
protect themselves against the possibility of a run  all of this implies a prolonged period of very
cautious lending and a high cost of capital for borrowers relative to benchmark interest rates  if the
current severe financial situation persists i think the flight to safety and liquidity could dry up credit
to a broad array of all but the very safest borrowers and reduce asset prices with feedbacks on
spending and that feedback loop could intensify if these market conditions pertain  i think thats a
substantial downside risk to the growth outlook
not all news affecting spending has been negative  capital goods orders have held up  the
decline in interest rates and commodity prices that respond to the markdown in global growth will
help support domestic demand and actions to stabilize the gses are helping the mortgage market
activity is more likely to stagnate than to decline  but i think that we can be more certain than we
were say at the end of june that the economy will move substantially away from our high
employment objective over the next several quarters and that the downside risks to that are larger
on the inflation side incoming data have been disappointing a little worse than anticipated
perhaps suggesting greater passthrough  the rise in import prices at the beginning of the third
quarter was higher than anticipated  but weve also learned over the last couple of months that oil
and other commodity prices can go down as well as up  the drop in retail energy prices helped to
reverse much of the runup in inflation expectations at the household level and reduced inflation
compensation in financial markets at least over the next five years  weaker economies along with
lower commodity prices are expected to reduce inflation in our trading partners and that along with
the dollar should lower import price inflation  the broadest measures of labor compensation
available through the second quarter continue to suggest no upward pressure on the pace of
increases in nominal labor costs  despite elevated headline inflation surprisingly good growth of
productivity is holding down unit labor costs  taking all of this together i think that despite the
incoming inflation data we can have greater confidence in our forecast that inflation will decline
late this year and run much lower in the next few years than in the past year or so though the risks
to that still lie on the upside until we actually see the decline in headline inflation persist
on policy mr chairman i support alternative b keeping the funds rate at 2 percent  i
think that at least for now is consistent with lower inflation and a slow return to full employment in
the future over time  we need to assess the effects of the financial turmoil  if asset price declines
accelerate and the tightening of financial conditions is large and likely to be sustained i would be
open at some point in the future to a lowering of interest rates  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me do three things  ill talk first about a
modal forecast but probably give it short shrift second about financial market conditions and third
about policy  working under the assumption that our modal forecast doesnt look quaint a week
from now if the world were somehow to hew to a reasonably moderate view of how financial
market conditions work going forward personally id be a bit more optimistic than the greenbook
for the second half of 08  i think that the net export growth is likely to prove stickier than
embedded in that forecast in spite of a stronger dollar and weaker global demand  but as we get to
2009 and 2010 i would actually be less rosy than the greenbook  i dont see real catalysts for the
economy to normalize and to approach trendlike growth  key uncertainties around financial
markets labor markets and housing and i think broader macroeconomic uncertainties that ive
discussed before in terms of trade policy tax policy and regulatory policy would make the creep
back to potential slower than embedded in those forecasts
on the inflation front i continue to be encouraged by the strength in the exchange value of
the dollar and the work that is doing for us on import price inflation  im encouraged by the move
down across a breadth of commoditiesnot just energy metals and food but really across the
entire basketbut im still not ready to relinquish my concerns on the inflation front
let me turn now to financial market conditions  i have talked before about the financial
architecture  i guess what we can say today with more confidence than ive been able to say before
is that the dismemberment of the existing financial architecture has accelerated in the last few days
and weeks and we will very quickly look at business models and industry will find new business
models we hope to provide credit to the real economy  financial markets have been testing
financial institutions with weaker capital structures uncertain management teams and unsustainable
business models  i think the question before us today thats hard to judge is whether financial
markets are now to the point at which they are acting indiscriminately testing all financial
institutions regardless of capital structure or business model  id say that the evidence of the past
twentyfour or fortyeight hours is still unclear  i think well have a greater clarity several days
from now about whether markets are able to make the distinguishing judgments that we would
count on
look at the cds spreads for the two remaining independent brokerdealers goldman sachs
and morgan stanley which bill referenced  goldman sachss cds moved up another 190 or so
this morning  they are up 340 in the last two days  morgan stanleys are up 690  i wouldnt want
to say whether those numbers are right or wrong  it may be that the business model is a failing
onethat is wholesale funding is no longer practicable in the world that were now in  if the
problems were confined to that part of the financial services industry it would be tough and it
would be ugly and if you were a resident of new york particularly painful  but i dont think it
would rise to the level that would force us to recalibrate monetary policy  but if in fact those
losses end up being endemic to all financial institutions even those with strong deposit bases and
higher capital ratios then we certainly would have to take that into consideration  the few that are
trying to swim against this tide are flailing and without extraordinary actions either by a consortium
of their competitors or by the official sector theyre likely to continue to fail  i think our efforts to
date to protect the broader financial markets and the economy from knockon effects in particular
financial services sectors do seem to be helping to cushion the blow  but the prospect of some
meaningful discontinuity and of some systemic risk remains real and its hard for me to judge today
whether that prospect is as low as we might have thought even some weeks ago
ultimately the question for the real economy is whether the emergence of this new financial
architecture can come quickly enough to get credit markets to normalize  is the suddenness of
events in the last week going to accelerate the move toward a new financial architecture  will the
forces of creative destruction make that faster but ultimately bring credit back to these markets
sooner  are these forces so strong and overwhelming that all financial institutions will be
hunkering down clinging to an architecture that no longer works  thats a question to which i
dont know the answer
a couple of more points on markets  i think the work that was done over the past few days
on lehman brothers should make us feel good in one respect  market functioning seems to be
working okayby which i mean that the plumbing around their role in the triparty repo business
due in part to the feds actions seems to be working  its ugly  the backroom offices of these
places are going crazy  theres a lot of manual work being done  so they wouldnt give it high
marks  but it looks as though positions are being sorted out in a tough workmanlike way and so
thats encouraging
other than the cds moves and the equity moves on the other brokerdealers goldman
sachs and morgan stanley i dont think that that is the real specter thats casting some question
over broader financial institutions  i think the lehman situation no matter what judgment we made
this past weekend about whether or not to provide officialsector money is not what is driving
markets broadly outside of the investment banks  whats driving the broader uncertainty are
questions about institutions like aig that were rated aaa that were so strong that counterparties
didnt need collateral and that were a certain bet to be a guarantor around stable value funds and all
sorts of other products  if in a matter of weeks that aaa rating and that security could turn out to
be worthless then that would force institutions to evaluate two things  first narrowly how much
aig exposure do i have  second more broadly if thats aig what about the rest of the insurance
companies  what about the rest of the financial institutions which arent investment banks but are
really representing the foundations of the us financial system  so it is both those direct and
indirect aspects that we have to try to understand as best we can  my own view is that the aig
question would be more financial devastation if these institutions turn out to be meaningfully
insolvent but actually in some ways less market dislocation among intermediaries  that is
lehman brothers merrill lynch and bear stearns are touching and are in the middle of many more
flows of data and there are real losses being felt  but if an aaa company like aig were really
fundamentally insolvent the direct losses to a range of institutions particularly those that are not
just wholesale institutions but are retail institutions could be very significant  i dont think we
know the answer yet to the question of whether aig speaks to a broader loss of confidence that
could affect the foundations of the us financial system
let me turn finally to policy mr chairman  i support alternative b and based on some of
the discussion from presidents lockhart and stern id make some simple suggestions that may
strike a balance that acknowledges the concerns we have about financial markets but doesnt put us
in the position where we are inclined to lurch in one direction which as some people suggested
could create more uncertainty than we intend  my suggestion mr chairman would be to take the
first sentence from alternative a paragraph 2strains in financial markets have increased
significantly and labor markets have weakened furtherand make that the first sentence of
alternative b  then strike the second sentence of alternative b because i think weve largely
covered that  that order gives proper attention it strikes me to the financial market developments
finally in the assessment of risk mr chairman if you look at the last sentence i would suggest
modifying that ever so slightly by inserting the word closely and making one other modification
so that last sentence would read the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial
developments closely and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price
stability  also if you think its acceptable rather than saying financial developments maybe
there we would say the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial market
developments closely  those would be my suggestions to try to strike that balancethat we are
keenly focused on whats going on but until we have a better view of its implications we are not
going to act  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  since the last meeting there have obviously
been a number of flareups in the fires that have been burning in the financial marketsthe gses
and then certainly whats come this past weekend and whats likely to come over this week and into
the future  a number of people have mentioned things ranging from aig to pressures on money
market funds to some large financial institutions  there are some very large regional banks and a
very large thrift that will be facing a lot of challenges as the uncertainties in the markets continue  i
wont repeat what governor kohn said about the continuing pressures on the bank balance sheets  i
think it is important to take into account that those pressures will be there going forward not only on
us institutions but also increasingly on international institutions  no one has mentioned ubs yet
but thats another institution about which theres a lot of concern and if you look at cds quotes
there they are skyrocketing also  much as governor warsh said i think that people are worried
about what the next shoe to drop will be and whom we have to challenge  whom do we have to get
more information about to make us feel comfortable  if that suddenly becomes everyone then of
course the markets dont function
i just want to focus quickly on consumption and consumer credit markets and then on
inflation and then ill conclude  we have made some references to how consumers have acted in
the past and whether they will continue to act this way  in some sense the consumer has been on a
marathon since the early 2000s facing an incredible amount of shocksa lot of contraction in
2001 significant declines in stock market wealth september 11 corporate governance scandals
sustained job losses and low real income growth  nonetheless the consumer continued to
consume  but now the consumer seems to be flagging  we have perhaps a very modest effect of
the stimulus which obviously can lead to negative payback for the rest of the yearso a drag going
forward as well as drags from housing and stock market wealth continuing job losses rising
unemployment and pressures on income  although many of these shocks were similar to ones that
happened earlier in the decade it seems that consumers do not have the same resilience now that
they did at one point  its not surprising that after having run this marathon theyre going to be a
bit tired
part of it could also be the credit conditions that are putting much more pressure on them
just to give you an anecdotal report but its from one of the largest providers of consumer credit in
the economy  after stabilization basically through our fomc meeting in august weve seen some
significant deterioration in delinquencies and in the performance of those who get into
delinquenciesthey roll right to full chargeoff much more rapidly  so we have seen not exactly a
qualitative change but a significant deterioration  also the ability to securitize credit cards has
changed dramatically  after our having opened the window and the markets having opened up in
the second quarter they basically havent been able to do anything in the third quarter and thats
before this weekend  obviously thats not going to be helping them
of course there are some offsetting factors that can help the consumer  the very significant
decline in mortgage rates has led to quite a response according to this very large provider of
consumer credit in the united states  the number of applications for mortgages particularly for
refis has doubled over the last couple of weeks  so people do respond to prices and that can help
to ease some of their income burdens  obviously the reduction in energy prices and many food
prices is helpful on that
but of course what has been good news for us consumers may not be good news for
international consumers  as a lot of people have mentioned the rest of the world is seeing a very
significant slowdown  i think the elevated commodity prices had helped to mask a lot of the
underlying fiscal and structural problems in these economies actually much like rising housing
prices in the united states had masked the problems in underwriting standards and what was going
on in the mortgage market  so i think there are going to be significant challenges in a lot of
countries around the world  the boost that we had earlier this year from the international sector is
something we cant rely on
on inflation were heartened by some of the lower energy prices  but i want to relate one
anecdote  in a meeting at the oecd the ceo of one of the largest private oil producers in the
world was asked what reference price he used because obviously he has to make tens of billions of
dollars of decisions on investment and so they thought heres someone who would really have a
good notion of what the price of oil would be going forward  without hesitation the person
responded 100 plus or minus 50  laughter  that kind of uncertainty from someone who is
really in the markets and making those kinds of decisions shows us that we have a reasonable
degree of uncertainty in inflation pressures going forward  that said i think the greenbook forecast
is where i would be also although were at uncomfortably elevated levels now  there are a lot of
reasons to believe that although they may be even a bit more elevated in the coming quarter there
are likely forces to bring things back down  this is particularly credible in the context of both
surveybased and marketbased expectations being quite contained the marketbased expectations
being at the low of the year or even over the last couple of years
so this brings me to support alternative b for no change today  on the statement i do
believe that some greater recognition of the stress would be valuable  i think it would be valuable to
have something in the first sentence of paragraph 2 that focuses on the strainsperhaps just a single
sentence about the strainsand then we can put the other pieces on consumption and housing into
the next sentence  it is important in the final paragraph to leave our options open if we do see
significant negative feedback effects so that we can make a move that wouldnt be a shock to the
markets but it also wouldnt be something that the markets could bank on  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i continue to focus on the traditional commercial
bank structure  i looked at two large retail banks three regional banks and three community banks
and two things came out of this  first capital is driving everything and the amount of capital that
the banks need is now being driven more by the analysts and the rating agencies than it is anything
that the regulators are doing  the banks feel as though they have done everything they can do in
terms of capital management  theyve quit buying back stock  theyve cut their dividends
theyve reduced expenses  there is no more capital available in external marketsnot common
stock not preferred not anything  one bank did issue some preferred stock through its own
networks and a common stock issueinterestingly sort of snuck it into the market  they dribbled it
out in small amounts because they found that as soon as the markets determined that they were
going to need to issue capital they started to short the stock figuring they could buy it back  so
they did almost a reverse stock buyback
the markets are fragile to dead  so what are they going to do  the only thing they can do
is contract the balance sheet and not lend  before i get to that there was again discussion in several
of the conversations about naked short selling  one bank reportedly had 103 percent of total
outstandings in short interest and that seemed odd to me  so i went and checked it this morning
and it turns out that it was not 103 percent  it was only 93 percent  but if you subtract out the stock
that was owned by the officers and the directors then it was over 100 percent  another bank said
that the rules in the disclosure that surround long positions have to be replicated somehow in short
positions because theyre having just as much control over what happens in the fate and the
management of the firm
so what are they doing in terms of credit  any heavy uses of credit or predominant uses of
credit are just not being done  this eliminates all commercial real estate  theyre actively trying to
move that off their books  participation loans in which the participants get only the credit piece are
drying up  those arent available  no bank has any interest in going back into residential
construction lending  one large bank said they were approving only onethird of the consumer
credit that they would have approved a year ago  the secondary market for jumbos for takeouts on
commercial are nonexistent and one bank told me that with the current cost of capital and cost of
funding the breakeven spread for a loan was 400 basis points over libor  thats the new lending
market and i dont see it getting any better until some capital is available
the credit quality side is actually a better story  first except for residential real estate its
really still pretty good  ci lending is holding up extremely well  in commercial real estate again
outside of residential development things are really looking pretty good  some small retail centers
are showing softness with the small storefronts and in areas like michigan theyre worried about
losing the anchor tenants  other than that everything is okay  the other consumer credit feels like
a mild recession but again is normally cyclical  home equity is awful  the bankoriginated loans
range from goodone institution had 39000 loans with 44 past dueto performing similar to
unsecured credit  the brokeroriginated loans especially the later vintages are 100 percent loss
within the mortgages the rate of acceleration in new pastdues has slowed down  about rejections
i asked them to project when the new delinquencies would be offset by the resolution of existing
delinquencies and they said somewhere between yearend 2008 and mid2009  so we are moving
through that process  the severity however continues to grow as housing prices decline  it does
appear that the portfolio lenders are getting their arms around the collection and the lossmitigation
effort  theyre assigning resources accountability and priority  it looks as though they are finally
set up to do a pretty good job on that managing it on several frontsthe analysis of the issue the
early stage collection contact and loss mitigationand actually assigning a permitted spend if you
will to resolve the loan  foreclosures are going to take a lot longer and are particularly affected by
state law  apparently in florida it takes a year to get a property in foreclosure  so those
foreclosures are going to happen over a fairly long period of time
i asked about a bottom and they said they do feel as though theyre seeing bottoms in some
marketsohio and coastal areas in california although not inland  las vegas and atlanta are
overbuilding but the inmigration will absorb it  florida is a bottomless holespeculation
combined with insurance problems  in arizona so much land was available that they cant find a
bottom there  regarding lot inventory a community banker in omaha said they had seven years of
inventory in terms of lots which i thought was pretty startling until i read in the american banker
the same story in atlanta and the same story in orlando  so i think when residential development
does resume it will be to work out the lot inventory  also the phantom inventory is at least as large
as the current inventoryphantom inventory being defined as people who want to sell but dont
want to sell in the current market  asked to compare current credit metrics with those in the 1980s
and 1990s one contact said they peaked in 1988 at 58 percent nonperforming  now they are at
166  i found a chart and for the entire industry nonperformers were 4 percent in 1991  theyre
12 percent right now  so the credit metrics are just nowhere near what they were in the sl crisis
for the industry
i came out of that really believing that if we are going to do something we need to address
the availability of capital to commercial banks but we should leave the bad loans in the banks
because theyre getting to the point where the portfolio lenders are doing a good job of working
through these loans  to try to take them out and put them into another structure we would just have
to replicate that whole gearingup process  i dont necessarily think thats the case with the
servicers particularly the servicers of privatelabel mortgages  thats something on which i know
weve done some research here and i want to investigate that a bit more to see if theres something
to be known there
in terms of the policy i too would favor alternative b with some change in the language to
paragraph 2  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you very much and thanks everyone for very
helpful comments  let me try to summarize and i will just make some comments and then we
can turn to the statement and policy
the group indicated of course that economic growth has slowed and looks to be quite
sluggish in the second half  i didnt hear a great deal of change in the general profile with most
people still viewing growth as being slow in the near term but perhaps recovering somewhat in
2009  but obviously there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that judgment  the ongoing
problems in housing and the financial system are of course the downside risks to growth
another factor which is becoming more relevant is the slowing global economy which together
with the stronger dollar may mean that us export growth will be somewhat less  despite the
tax rebate consumer spending seems likely to be weak in the near term reflecting a variety of
factors that we noted before including housing and equity wealth credit conditions and
particularly perhaps the ongoing weakness in the labor market  the labor market is
deteriorating with unemployment up although ui programs may play some role in the
unemployment rate  it is somewhat difficult to predict the peak of the unemployment rate given
the upward momentum we are seeing  declines in energy prices however will improve real
incomes and help consumer sentimentso that is a potentially positive factor
the housing sector continues to be the central concern in the economy in both the real
and the financial sides  there are no clear signs of stabilization although obviously regional
conditions vary considerably  the government action regarding the gses has lowered mortgage
rates and may be of some assistance  credit conditions have tightened though in other areas as
well including nonresidential construction
firms are continuing to struggle with weaker demand higher uncertainty and high costs
manufacturing has been relatively stable to weaker but we had at least one report of a survey
that in the medium term the outlook is looking a little better  inventories appear to be relatively
well managed  credit conditions for business vary but there are indications that some firms are
finding it very difficult to attract capital
financial markets received a lot of attention around the table  conditions clearly have
worsened recently despite the rescue of the gses the latest stressor being the bankruptcy of
lehman brothers and other factors such as aig  almost all major financial institutions are
facing significant stress particularly difficulties in raising capital and credit quality is
problematic particularly in residentialrelated areas  one member noted that it is not evident
that markets are clearly differentiating between weaker and stronger firms at this point
deleveraging is continuing and securitization markets are moribund  credit terms and
conditions are quite tight and may be a significant drag on the economy  however the medium
term implications of the recent increases in financial stress for the economy are difficult to
assess  we may have to wait for some time to get greater clarity on the implications of the last
week or so
on the inflation front recent core and headline numbers have been high reflecting earlier
increases in the prices of energy and raw materials  there are positive factors including the
significant intermeeting declines in the prices of oil and other commodities which if maintained
would bring headline inflation down rather notably by the end of the year or next year  the
dollar has also strengthened  generally speaking inflation expectations though noisy have
improved  we have seen a decline in tips breakevens and some decline in survey expectations
as well  but it was noted that the fivebyfive tips breakeven remains above a level consistent
with longterm price stability  nominal wage growth has remained subdued so far slack is
increasing productivity has been strong and therefore unit labor costs are well controlled
again all of these factors are positive in terms of a better inflation picture going forward  on
the other hand recent declines notwithstanding the cumulative increases in commodity prices
over the past year or so do remain large and there is some evidence that these cost increases are
being passed through into core prices  commodity prices are extremely volatile which makes
inflation very difficult to forecast and makes the inflation outlook therefore quite uncertain
wages could also begin to rise more quickly as the economy strengthens  for all these reasons
inflation risks are still in play and remain a concern for the committee  some participants
reiterated their concern that maintaining rates too low for too long risks compromising our
credibility and stimulating inflation over the medium run  that is a very quick survey of the
comments  are there any comments or questions
if not let me just make a few comments  personally i see the prospects for economic
growth in the foreseeable future as quite weak notwithstanding the second quarters strength  i
think what we saw in the recent labor reports removes any real doubt that we are in a period that
will be designated as an official nber recession  unemployment rose 11 percentage points in
four months which is a relatively rapid rate of increase  the significance of that for our
deliberations is again that there does seem to be some evidence that in recession regimes the
dynamics are somewhat more powerful and we tend to see more negative and correlated
innovations in spending equations  so i think that we are in for a period of quite slow growth
that is confirmed by what we are seeing in consumption which probably would be quite
negative if it werent for the remainder of the fiscal stimulus package  other components of
demand are likewise quite weak  we are all familiar with the housing situation  some other
factors that were supportive in q2 are weakeninga number of people have noted the export
growth  actually it is net exportswhich is importantnot just exports and we are seeing both
slowing growth in exports and some forecast of increased growth in imports
a factor that we havent talked about much is the fiscal side  that has been supportive
and may be less supportive going forward  generally speaking though i do thinkand i have
said this for a long timethat the credit effects will be important  they operate with a lag  it is
very difficult to judge the lag  but my strong sense is that they are still some distance from their
peak that they will begin to be felt outside of housing in nonresidential construction for
example in consumer spending and in investment and that this is going to be independent of
last weeks financial developments  i think that is going to be a major drag probably well into
next year
there are a few positives which give some hope of some improvement next year  we
have talked about energy and commodity prices as they relate to inflation but of course the
decline in energy and commodity prices is also a plus for consumers and raises real incomes and
would be supportive of sentiment as we have already seen  there are a few positive indications
here and there on the housing market a few glimmers of stability particularly in some regions  i
think that the gse stabilization is going to be very important  it has already lowered mortgage
rates  it suggests that there will be a market for securitized mortgages and i think that is
positive  so if i wanted to outline an optimistic scenario it would involve stronger indications of
stabilization in housing which in turn would feed into more confidence in the financial sector
and would lead over time to improvement in the broader economy
i do think that financial conditions are a major concern  the situation right now is very
uncertain and we are not by any means away from significant systemic risk  even if we avoid a
major systemic event the increase in risk aversion the pullback from all counterparties the
deleveraging the sale of assetsall of these things are going to continue for some time and are
going to make the financial sector very stressed which obviously will have effects on the
economy
i have been grappling with the question i raised for president lacker and i would be very
interested in hearing other views either now or some other time  the ideal way to deal with
moral hazard is to have in place before the crisis begins a welldeveloped structure that gives
clear indications in what circumstances and on what terms the government will intervene with
respect to a systemically important institution  we have found ourselves though in this episode
in a situation in which events are happening quickly and we dont have those things in place
we dont have a set of criteria we dont have fiscal backstops and we dont have clear
congressional intent  so in each event in each instance even though there is this sort of
unavoidable ad hoc character to it we are trying to make a judgment about the costsfrom a
fiscal perspective from a moral hazard perspective and so onof taking action versus the real
possibility in some cases that you might have very severe consequences for the financial system
and therefore for the economy of not taking action  frankly i am decidedly confused and very
muddled about this  i think it is very difficult to make strong bright lines given that we dont
have a structure that has been well communicated and well established for how to deal with these
conditions  i do think there is some chanceit is not yet large but still some chancethat we
will in fact see a much bigger intervention at the fiscal level  one is tempted to argue that by
doing more earlier you can avoid even more later but of course that is all contingent and
uncertain  so we will collectively do our best to deal with these very stressful financial
conditions which i dont think will be calm for some time
with respect to inflation i accept the many caveats around the table  i have to say that i
think on net inflation pressures are less worrisome now  the last two meetings have been very
positive in that respect  the declines in energy and commodity prices are quite substantial
natural gas for example has reversed all of its gains of the year  steel scrap is down 40 percent
in two months  we are seeing many other indications that commodity prices really have come
down quite a bit  the dollars increase is also quite striking and we have talked about wages
tips and other factors  so i think overall i see at least the nearterm inflation risk as
considerably reduced  i do agree though with the points that were made that we may well see
pressure on core inflation for a while longer despite this mornings reasonably benign number
the increases in commodity costs although they have been partially reversed have not been
entirely reversed  certainly over the last year to year and a half there is still a net substantial
increase which will show up as firms begin to pass through those costs
it is also the case of course that we have seen a very very sharp movement in
commodity prices and the dollar  therefore there is no logical reason why that couldnt be
reversed  clearly one problem we face is that the uncertainty about forecasting commodity
prices is so large that it makes our forecasting exercises extraordinarily uncertain and means that
we need to be somewhat more careful than we otherwise would be if we were back in the days of
the texas railroad commission when we knew the price of oil six months in advance  we
dont have that privilege anymore  so i think core inflation may be elevated for a while  it may
take a while for inflation to moderate  everything i say is contingent on the dollar and
commodity trends not being strongly reversed  but if those things are not reversed i think we
will see some improvement in inflation in the near term
i also agree with those who say that when the time comes we do need to be prompt at
removing accommodation  it is just as much a mistake to move too late and allow inflation and
perhaps even financial imbalances to grow as it is to move too early and be premature in terms
of assuming a recovery  i think that is a very difficult challenge for us going forward and i
acknowledge the importance of that which a number of people have noted
so that is a quick summary of my views  let me just turn briefly then to policy  do we
have the statement  let me just preview  i talked with governor warsh and he gave me now
during the break some of those suggestions he made  as they fit closely with other things that
people said around the table we have made a version here that incorporates them  ill discuss
that in just a minute3
first as a number of people have said let me just say that i thought the memo that the
staff prepared over the intermeeting period was extraordinarily helpful  we have been debating
around the table for quite a while what the right indicator of monetary policy is  is it the federal
funds rate  is it some measure of financial stress  or what is it  i think the only answer is that
the right measure is contingent on a model  as president lacker and president plosser pointed
out you have to have a model and a forecasting mechanism to think about where the interest rate
is that best achieves your objectives  it was a very useful exercise to find out at least to some

3  the statement referred to here is appended to this transcript appendix 3
extent how the decline in the funds rate that we have put into place is motivated  in particular
the financial conditions do appear to be important both directly and indirectlydirectly via the
spreads and other observables that were put into the model and indirectly in terms of negative
residuals in spending equations and the like  the recession dynamics were also a big part of the
story  i hope that what this memo does for usagain i think its extraordinarily helpfulis to
focus our debate better  as president plosser pointed out we really shouldnt argue about the
level of the funds rate or the level of the spreads  we should think about the forecast and
whether our policy path is consistent with achieving our objectives over the forecast period  i
am sympathetic to the general view taken by the staff which argues that those recession
dynamics and financial restraints are important that we are looking at slow growth going
forward and that inflation is likely to moderate  based on those assumptions i think that our
policy is looking actually pretty good  to my mind our quick move early this year which was
obviously very controversial and uncertain was appropriate  their analysis also suggests that
the amount of insurance that we have is perhaps limited given that they take a riskneutral kind
of modeling approach  having said that i think they have also clearly set out the conditions and
the framework in which we can debate going forward exactly where we should be going  to the
extent that those around the table disagree with the model or with the projection then that is the
appropriate way it seems to me to address our policy situation  so again i do very much
appreciate that  it helped me think about the policy situation  as i said i think our aggressive
approach earlier in the year is looking pretty good particularly as inflation pressures have
seemed to moderate
overall i believe that our current funds rate setting is appropriate and i dont really see
any reason to change  on the one hand i think it would be inappropriate to increase rates at this
point  it is simply premature  we dont have enough information  there is not enough pressure
on inflation at this juncture to do that  on the other hand cutting rates would be a very big step
that would send a very strong signal about our views on the economy and about our intentions
going forward and i think we should view that step as a very discrete thing rather than as a 25
basis point kind of thing  we should be very certain about that change before we undertake it
because i would be concerned for example about the implications for the dollar commodity
prices and the like  so it is a step we should take only if we are very confident that that is the
direction in which we want to go
therefore my recommendation to the committeeand i will open it up for comment in a
momentis to keep the funds rate at its current level  i listened very carefully to the
conversation around the table in terms of the statement  i think it was president lockhart
president stern and governor warsh among others who talked about strengthening the
language on financial markets  so the draft statement that you have in front of you is an attempt
to make that change  it has two changes relative to existing alternative b  first as governor
warsh suggested it reverses the first two sentences and so focuses in the first sentence on
strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened
further and then the rest of it is basically the same as it was  the other change which is in the
last paragraph in the risk assessment is pretty small but it is probably worth considering  the
word closely has been added to suggest obviously that we understand that the situation is
changing rapidly and that we are carefully following conditions as they evolve  kevin we took
your word market therewhat was the rationale for it
mr warsh  my sense isand this is certainly open for discussionthat we want the
focus to be that we are really watching market developments closely  we are not trying to
monitor the broader economy which we might not be able to measure too much  i will admit
that we have economic and financial markets with closely modifying both of them but the
idea was to put the focus on the market side to a slightly greater extent than we normally do
chairman bernanke  okay  so i think thats useful although i do note that all
else being equal theres a slight barrier for making any change and that one word is a change
president fisher
mr fisher  i am sort of indifferent about this but i dont want to forget what
governor duke was talking about  its not just financial markets its financial developments
we are also talking about the internal dynamics of what is happening in the banking system and
the credit contraction you spoke of  so we lead off with financial markets  i dont want people
to think we are focusing only on marketsgovernor warsh i would disagree on that point  its
a minor disagreement but i think it is overkill
chairman bernanke  all right  let me open it up for any other comments on the
statement or the policy action  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  it is really just a question  what type of
reaction do we think will be engendered by inserting closely  everybody understands that we
monitor financial developments very carefully  so we are bringing attention to this  will there
be a presumption that we are likely to do something intermeeting or something like that  i am
not saying that is wrong but it is a question
mr dudley  i would say that the markets will take it as a statement that is
conditional on what happens in markets  if markets get sufficiently bad if there is some
threshold of deterioration that can potentially provoke an intermeeting move is the way i think
they would take it  brian would you agree with that
mr madigan  i agree  the fact that the first sentence of the risk assessment has a
parallel treatment of the upside and downside risks may communicate a bit the sense that you are
not ready to ease immediately
chairman bernanke  okay  we will decide  we will take a vote on it if
necessary  president lacker
mr lacker  yes  i echo president evanss concern  my recollection isand i
havent consulted the record recentlyunder your predecessor there was some phrasing like
watch market developments closely that came to be widely understood as a signal of an
intermeeting move
chairman bernanke  i think it was monitor closely  is that what it was
mr lacker  monitor closely or some language like that
chairman bernanke  yes monitor closely  maybe youre right
mr lacker  yes and that gives me pause  then about marketlike a lot of
economists i am willing to construe the word market very broadly to include intermediation
mechanisms of all types and the market for commercial credit in you know dillon south
carolina  laughter  but i am not sure that market participants are going to take it that broadly
they are going to take it in the sense of markets in traded financial instruments and organized
exchanges and such  i just wonder if they are going to interpret it too closely as wall street
chairman bernanke  okay  so the sentiment over here on this side is that
nobody thinks market is important  lets get rid of market  well discuss closely
president plosser
mr plosser  i think market may be construed too narrowly  we dont really mean
it that way i dont think
chairman bernanke  market is already gone  all right  other comments
suggestions or thoughts  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  but i do think it is the delta so it is the change  by including
closely i think the markets are going to look very closely at that change and they are going to
think that we are clearly trying to convey something with that  i just think we have to make sure
that we feel comfortable in doing so  certainly some people have suggested that they would be
happy to move 50 basis points if they saw the markets moving but i do think that that one
particular word will get a lot of attention  not that it should but i think it is going to be focused
on  just as at one point we used the word yet and that got an enormous amount of attention
and this has two syllables  laughter
mr fisher  unless you are from the south  laughter
chairman bernanke  the sad thing is that governor kroszner is right  we have
seventeen people debating over this word and it actually does matter  does anyone else want to
weigh in  okay  i think my sense is that there should be a barrier a bit of a hurdle to changing
so i am leaning toward sticking with what we have  would that be okay governor warsh do
you think
mr warsh  on closely
chairman bernanke  getting rid of closely
mr warsh  let me ask brian and bill  brian without closely how do you think
the markets will react to that
mr madigan  that you are not particularly ready to change your stance of policy
mr dudley  i think the expectation going in is for most people that you are not
prepared to ease today but if things got really dark from here you would  so the question is
how do you convey that with the right word  you need something in between closely and
mr warsh  i think the sentiment we are trying to suggest is watchful waiting  we are
not indifferent we are not clueless we are paying attention but we are not predisposed  hence
governor kohns suggestion
mr kohn  my suggestion was to substitute carefully for closely  i agree that
monitor closely had this other connotation but i think we should be seen as paying more
attention than usual  there might be another alternative
mr dudley  the committee will carefully evaluate economic and financial market
developments  that means you are on the case
chairman bernanke  well it is not an analytical thing we are doing  we are just
watching closely
mr warsh  keenly  carefully
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes  president lacker
mr lacker  including closely what does that imply about the opposite  i mean
are we going to be able to take that out
mr warsh  well we have done things like in a timely manner and other kinds of
phraseology
mr lacker  yes but this is an adjective
chairman bernanke  no its an adverb
mr lacker  there goes my credibility  laughter  if we take it out can we use the
phrase without it
chairman bernanke  what we have done in the past is basically just use a new
phrase
mr lacker  so that means we have to throw this phrase out
mr warsh  mr chairman i would support carefully
chairman bernanke  is that better  president evans
mr evans  just to be clear we have gone a long way just now from its being a
semantic discussion to whether or not the committee wants to hint at the possibility of a near
term action  i do not have a problem with that  in fact in my comments i suggested that the
resolution of uncertainty might improve in the next couple of weeks but that seems to be the
principal issue here which i dont really recall us discussing in as much detail as we just have
chairman bernanke  no youre right  but there is another issue which i think is
the thing were concerned about and which motivates the change in alternative b paragraph 2
we dont want the world to feel that we are not awake that we are not paying attention  we
know that very unusual things are going on in the financial markets and we are prepared maybe
not through monetary policy but through whatever mechanism is necessary to address that
mr evans  right  so i fully support that sentiment and if you find the right wording
that captures it thats fine with me
chairman bernanke  other comments  president plosser
mr plosser  as long as we are throwing monkey wrenches into the language i think
we do signal our concern  in paragraph 2 we put the very first sentence which says strains in
financial markets have increased significantly  so we have acknowledged that at the very top of
this statement  so there is no going back on that  i am a little concerned about what moving
back closely means  another alternative that ill throw out would be rather than use
closely to say that the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial
developments
several  thats what it said last time
mr plosser  well that seems fine  we are monitoring these things  is this the
fomc statement dictionary we are going to  is this the code book  laughter
chairman bernanke  any other comments  all right  let me just ask for a straw
vote closely no closely or carefully  do we want carefully  all right  is carefully
more acceptable to those who are concerned
mrkohn  its less of a code word  the intention was to loosen it up a bit but not
revert to those code words that nearly promise intermeeting action
mr plosser  we make note of this in the lexicon of fomc terminology
chairman bernanke  the semiotics class will begin as soon as thelaughter
all right  carefullyis that okay  im seeing nodding  all right  governor warsh
mr warsh  yes sir
mr kohn  im closing the dictionary
chairman bernanke  all right  so we are changing the last part of that sentence
we are striking the word market and changing closely to carefully  any other comments
or thoughts on the substance sizzle or marketing  or as rick would say moychandising
but hes not here  laughter  all right  if not ms danker
ms danker  i will be reading the directive from the bluebook and the statement that
was just circulated  the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial
conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its
longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets
consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 2 percent
then the statement is as it was handed out except the last sentence reads the
committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to
promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
chairman bernanke                              yes first vice president cumming              yes governor duke                                     yes
president fisher                                     yes
governor kohn                                     yes
governor kroszner                               yes
president pianalto                                 yes
president plosser                                   yes
president stern                                      yes
governor warsh                                    yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  the next meeting is october 28 and 29  lunch
will be available in the anteroom  while we have lunch laricke blanchard will provide us with
an update on congressional developments  thank you all very much  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
