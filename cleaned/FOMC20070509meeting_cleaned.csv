transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of may 9 2007
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  we start with the desk
operations bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the handout with the blue on the front  the market turbulence that began in earnest on february 27 is now a distant memory  risk appetites have recovered volatility in the fixed income and equity markets has declined and the us equity market has climbed to a new high  exhibits 1 2 and 3 show the correlation matrices for the daily price and yield movements in the fixed income equity and currency markets  the blueshaded boxes indicate correlations with an absolute value greater than 05  as shown in exhibit 1 until february 27 the correlations across most of these asset pairs were low  however beginning on february 27 through mid to late march correlations rose sharply as riskreduction efforts dominated financial markets  this shift can be seen in exhibit 2 where all but one of the boxes are shaded blue  since the march fomc meeting calm has returned with assetprice movements again becoming mostly uncorrelated  the matrix shown in exhibit 3 which shows the correlations since the march fomc meeting looks similar to exhibit 1
as i mentioned in my briefing at the march meeting although the turmoil in the markets was related mostly to riskreduction efforts in certain areasthe subprime mortgage market is the best examplethe deterioration in performance was related mostly to fundamental developments  as can be seen in exhibits 4 and 5 which plot delinquencies and losses for the notorious 2006 subprime vintage the deterioration in performance has continued apace  exhibit 4 shows that delinquencies of more than sixty days for the 2006 vintage are even higher than those for the 2001 vintage  this is noteworthy because in 2001 the us economy experienced a mild recession and payroll employment was declining  even more noteworthy is the trend of losses for the 2006 vintage  as shown in exhibit 5 losses for the 2006 vintage are running at about triple the rate of the 2001 vintage  this poor loss experience appears due both to deterioration in underwriting standards and to lessfavorable underlying conditionsfor example the softening trend of home prices in many local markets
the fundamental deterioration in the subprime mortgage sector can also be seen in other measures of performance  for example exhibit 6 illustrates the behavior of bbbrated spreads for the abx cds and cash markets  the abx represents an index of twenty credit default swaps on twenty bbbrated assetbacked securities and the bbb cash index represents the yield spread on the bbbrated tranches of the assetbacked securities  thus the abx index references via the credit default swap market the underlying assetbacked securities market  as can be seen in this exhibit although all three spreads have recovered somewhat over the past few weeks spreads

1  material used by mr dudley is appended to this transcript appendix 1
remain much wider than earlier in the year  also note that abx spreads remain considerably wider than the cds and cash spreads that they reference  this situation underscores the illiquidity of the abx market and may partially reflect the lack of a natural constituency of investors who might wish to take the long side of this index especially when the subprime market is under stress  the problems in subprime mortgages have spilled over into the collateralized debt obligation cdo market  as you may recall many cdos have a substantial proportion of their assets in lower rated subprime assetbacked security tranches  after widening sharply in late february the yield spreads on mezzanine structuredfinance cdos have shown no recovery  in fact as shown in exhibit 7 the spreads on these cdos have continued to widen
at the last fomc meeting i argued that the selloff in the equity market that began in late february had at least one fundamental componentthe reduction in earnings expectations for 2007  yet the equity market has recovered quite strongly  i think that this can be explained by three factors  first earnings in the first quarter were stronger than expected  the board staff estimates that firstquarter earnings for the sp 500 will have increased about 9 percent on a yearoveryear basis  second perhaps as a result earnings expectations have stabilized  as shown in exhibit 8 the median bottomup equity analyst forecast for sp 500 earnings growth in 2007 has stopped falling and remains above 6 percent  third buyout and buyback activity continues unabated  exhibit 9 shows the flow of funds data on net equity issuance
as can be seen the outstanding supply of us equities is shrinking rapidly in contrast to the increase in net supply that occurred over the 200004 period  buyouts and buybacks may also be a factor explaining the recent behavior of corporate credit spreads  as shown in exhibit 10 highyield and emergingmarket debt spreads have mostly recovered since the late february widening  however investmentgrade debt spreads remain wider than in early 2007  investmentgrade debt performance may be lagging because investors fear that the credit quality of this debt will be undermined as buyouts and buybacks result in increased leverage
turning now to the currency markets an emerging story is the weakness of the
us dollar  as shown in exhibit 11 the dollar has fallen about 3 percent against the euro since the start of the year and is virtually flat against the yen over this period the weakness against the euro appears to reflect mostly changing interest rate expectations  exhibit 12 plots the spread between the june 2008 eurodollar contract and the euribor contract  as can be seen in this exhibit the expected interest rate differential has fallen about 40 basis points this year  as this has occurred the euro has strengthened  to date the dollars weakness has not been of much concern to market participants  the decline has been gradual and investors perceive that global imbalances are unwinding smoothly  nevertheless the subprime debacle points to another source of risk for the dollar  in recent years the net acquisition of dollar denominated financial assets by foreign investors has shifted to private flows from public flows and to corporate bonds including assetbacked securities and cdo obligations from treasury and agency debt  this shift is shown in exhibit 13  my worry here is that the problems in the subprime and alta mortgage market could
ultimately affect foreign investors appetites for us assetbacked securities and cdos  for example a particularly poor performance of lowerrated abs and cdo tranches coupled with the widespread corporate rating downgrades that might be associated with such poor performance could cause foreign investors to lose confidence in investing in dollardenominated debt
in terms of us interest rate expectations investors expect no nearterm change  in policy  however market participants continue to expect significant easing late this year and in 2008  interest rate expectations for the remainder of 2007 are back where they were at the time of the january fomc meeting  looking at the federal funds rate futures market in exhibit 14 we can see that only about one 25 basis point rate cut is expected in 2007  in contrast expectations for 2008 more closely resemble expectations at the time of the december and march fomc meetings not the january meeting  as can be seen in exhibit 15 which plots eurodollar futures contract yields investors expect substantial monetary policy easing in 2008  why this delayed pattern of easing  there are three potential explanations  first as i have noted before futures market yields reflect the mean not the modal forecast  to the extent that investors perceive a moderate risk of significant economic weakness that could lead to pronounced monetary policy easing then the yields in the futures market could be well below the modal forecasts of investors  second some investors may disagree with the fomc about the outlook  in this case they might anticipate that it will take time for the fomc to come around to their way of thinkingleading to rate cuts that occur only later  third some investors may anticipate that inflation will moderate  as this happens the fomc might gradually reduce its nominal federal funds rate target following lower inflationessentially keeping the real federal funds rate constant
finally the survey of the primary dealers shows little change in interest rate expectations since the last fomc meeting  exhibits 16 and 17 compare dealer expectations with market expectations before the march fomc meeting and before this meeting  the horizontal bold lines represent market expectations  the blue circles represent the different dealer forecasts and the size of a circle represents how many dealers have that forecast  the green circles represent the average dealer forecast for each period  the average of the primary dealer forecasts is consistent with only slightly more than 25 basis points of easing through the end of this year not much different from what is priced into the federal funds futures market  as can be seen the dispersion of the dealer forecasts over the next few quarters has narrowed a bit  however considerable disagreement remains about whether shortterm rates will be higher or lower a year ahead  also the average of the dealer forecasts for 2008 remains considerably above market expectations  this presumably reflects mainly the downside risks notion which should cause the modal forecasts of dealers to be higher than the mean expectations represented by futures prices  ill be happy to take any questions
i will need approval for domestic operations there were no foreign operations
also i circulated a memo asking you to vote to approve renewal of the swap lines to canada and mexico
chairman bernanke  okay  questions  president fisher
mr fisher  i have two questions  on page 2 when you talk about subprime paper do
we have any data that can tell us anything about the stress in the alta markets specifically
mr dudley  there is definitely some spillover into alta but alta delinquencies and
losses are a fraction of subprime  if you compare the characteristics of alta loans with those of
subprime loans youll see the same easing of underwriting standards in the alta market that
occurred in the subprime market and almost identical characteristics of the underwriting
standards except for one differencethe fico score  the fico score for alta is much higher
apparently the fico score is pretty important because the losses for alta are a fraction of those
on subprimes  but there are data that show some spillover
mr fisher  my second question regards sp earnings  is there a way to split out
what comes from the rest of the world and what comes from the united states  i know it would
be analytically difficult but im just wondering if there is a disparity between the two in what
drops to the bottom line
mr dudley  im sure there is a disparity between the two  i do not know of any way
to break that out clearly  one factorthe weakness of the dollar versus the eurois definitely
helping to boost corporate earnings  a disproportionate share of us foreign activity is europe
oriented so its a bigger share than would be suggested by the european share of global gdp
that factor is definitely helping to support our earnings  i have never seen any data on that
well look into it to see if theres anything but im not hopeful
mr fisher  thanks bill
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  we need a vote to ratify
domestic open operations
mr kohn  so moved
chairman bernanke  passed without objection  we also need a vote on the swap
lines
ms minehan  so moved
chairman bernanke  weve discussed this in the past  the swap lines serve
partly a diplomatic function and they have some relevance to potential financial crises if theyre
needed for dollar liquidity either in canada or in mexico  however i will bring these up with
secretary paulson at some point just to make sure that the treasury is aware of what were
doingwhether we need to expand them or reduce them  so weve had a motion without
objection  okay then the swap lines are approved  lets turn now to the economic situation
dave
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  in this forecast round you as policymakers were faced with an identification problem similar to that which we as econometricians so often confront  although the greenbook forecast is essentially the same as it was in march several observationally equivalent hypotheses could explain this outcome  first abject laziness on the part of the staff second brilliant prescience on our part or third what i assume is your working null hypothesis dumb luck  laughter  well i can assure you that abject laziness can be ruled out it took much agonizing endless meetings and a lot of hard work to do nothing  we are after all still part of the federal government  laughter  as for prescience and luck they did combine to leave the outlook pretty much as it was at the time of the last greenbook  we still believe that the economy has been growing at a pace less than its potential held down by the ongoing slump in housing activity  as the drag from residential investment abates growth of real output is expected to pick up  but that reacceleration of activity is limited by a diminishing impetus to consumer spending from housing wealth and a reasonably restrictive monetary policy
let me begin by citing a few areas of the forecast in which developments have unfolded much as we had anticipated  ill then move on to some of the areas of notable surprise that luckily had offsetting effects on the outlook  first the beas advance estimate of real gdp in the first quarter showed an increase of 1 percent
that was close to our forecast both on the total and in the particulars  as expected the decline in residential investment took a significant bite out of firstquarter growth as did net exports and defense spending  outlays for equipment were also quite soft
we view the meager gain in real gdp posted in the first quarter as exaggerating the weakness early this year  in particular we are anticipating defense spending to bounce back in the second quarter to a level more consistent with appropriations and we expect net exports to largely reverse their firstquarter drop  as a consequence we are projecting real gdp to advance at a pace of a bit more than 2 percent in the second quarter  smoothing through the temporary ups and downs we believe that the economy probably has been expanding at a pace of about 2 percent in the first half of this year the same rate that we had projected in the march greenbook
a second major piece of our story that appears to be receiving support from the incoming data is our forecast that consumption growth would slow noticeably  a projected stepdown in the growth of consumption is an important reason that in our forecast even as the housing contraction eventually wanes growth in real gdp remains below the pace of its potential  although it is far too early to claim victory consumer spending on goods has flattened out in recent months after sharp increases at the turn of the year  the shallow trajectory of spending as we move into the second quarter a lower level of real disposable income and sluggish chain store sales suggest that our forecast of 2 percent growth of real pce in the current quarter is within comfortable reach  however i would like it noted for the record that i am not characterizing this as a slam dunk  laughter
a third key element of our story in the last greenbook was that even though equipment outlays had weakened over the past few quarters we did not believe that this weakness was the front edge of a more serious retrenchment in capital spending in that regard we received a bit of reassurance from an upturn in the shipments of nondefense capital goods in march and an even larger jump in new orders for these goods  those data suggest that hightech investment remains on a solid uptrend whereas investment outside high tech and transportation seems poised for a modest upturn in the second quarter after sizable declines over the preceding six months  as expected purchases of heavy trucks remain the area of most notable weakness
needless to say the data for investment are so volatile that we remain cautious about concluding that the downside risk to capital spending has abated much  but given our recent track record in this area you might consider it good news when the staff reports no news
a fourth element of our story that at least for now seems to be panning out is that the inventory overhangs that emerged in the second half of last year would be worked off relatively smoothly rather than cumulating into something more serious in the motor vehicle sector steep production cuts in the second half of last year and early this year coupled with a moderate pace of sales have brought days supply of light vehicles down to comfortable levels  indeed the automakers have scheduled some increases in production in the current quarter  outside motor vehicles manufacturers appear to have adjusted production reasonably promptly to the
unintended buildup of stocks  indeed manufacturing ip excluding motor vehicles declined at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter and increased only a paltry 2 percent in the first quarter  some bookvalue measures of inventorysales ratios remain elevated but measures of days supply from our flowofgoods system have shown an improvement that parallels reports from purchasing managers of fewer inventory problems among their customers  moreover factory output increased sharply in march and the available physical product data and the readings from the labor market report point to another sizable increase in april  so the evidence seems to suggest that the inventory correction is abating  i should note that yesterdays figures on wholesale inventories in march came in below what was assumed by the bea in the advance estimate of gdp  all else being equal those data suggest a downward revision in firstquarter real gdp growth of about  percentage point  in response wed probably add a similar amount to our secondquarter estimate of real gdp
finally another central element of our forecast has been that labor demand would slow in lagged response to the downshift in the growth of overall activity  we have been counseling patience in the face of data in this area that persistently surprised us to the upside  last weeks labor market report provides at least a shred of evidence in support of our story  private payrolls increased 63000 in april and there was a downward revision of 24000 in februaryleaving the level of employment below that incorporated in the may greenbook  gains in private payrolls have averaged about 90000 per month over the past three months and we expect that pace to be maintained over the remainder of the quarter  the unemployment rate increased to
45 percent last month also in line with our projection
putting these pieces together we are feeling a bit more confident of our story that activity is increasing at a subpar 2 percent pace in the first half of the year  we are also a bit less worried about the upside risks posed by labor demand and consumption and about the downside risks posed by investment spending and inventoriesbut just a bit less worried
our longerterm outlook has changed little as well  we have revised down our forecast for the growth of real gdp this year by 01 percentage point to 2 percent and revised up our forecast for 2008 by a similar amount to 24 percent  i would like to argue that these very small adjustments are a testament to our prescience but ill have to admit that we seem to have benefited more from dumb luck  in brief the negative consequences of a weaker outlook for housing activity and higher projected oil prices were just about offset by the positive effects of higher equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar
turning first to the housing market the surprise has not been in actual construction activity where starts have exceeded our expectations a bit  rather the real news has been on home salesin particular the sales of new homes  not only did newhome sales drop in march to a level below our expectations sales were revised down in the preceding months as well  as a consequence the months supply
of unsold new homes has moved up sharply further in recent months instead of tipping down as we had earlier expected  moreover sales cancellations which had appeared to be heading down turned back up in march  some of this further weakening may reflect the continuing fallout from the pullback in subprime lending but we also think that housing demand more generally has continued to soften  with sales now projected to flatten out a lower level than we had previously thought and with the months supply of unsold homes at a higher level we anticipate that the production adjustment will be deeper and longer than was incorporated in our march forecast  moreover these developments also led us to trim a bit from our houseprice forecast  another source of downward revision in our outlook for real activity was a
6 per barrel increase in the price of imported oil over the intermeeting period  as karen will discuss shortly oil prices have backed off some since the completion of the greenbook but they are still running above our march forecast  the effect of higher crude prices has been amplified by a jump in gasoline margins  those margins have soared as both planned and unplanned refinery outages have resulted in a substantial drop in gasoline inventories  all else being equal higher consumer energy prices will likely put a noticeable dent in household incomes and consumer spending in coming months
of course not all else has been equal  stock prices are about 7 percent above the march greenbook assumption and in our forecast the associated higher level of household net worth provides greater support to consumer spending and largely offsets the effects of lower real incomes  another positive offset to weaker housing and higher oil prices is the lower projected path for the dollar  the dollar dropped about 2 percent over the intermeeting period and is expected to remain below our previous projection by about that amount  a lower dollar and the accompanying higher prices for imports provide added impetus to domestic production as foreign and domestic demands are shifted toward domestic producers  with nearterm developments unfolding about as we had expected and our longerterm projection benefiting from some powerful crosscurrents we continue to present you with a reasonably benign outlook  growth slows but doesnt falter as actual output moves into alignment with potential
in contrast to our forecast of real activity we have made some notable changes to our projection of overall price inflation in the near term  in particular the recent run up in gasoline prices is leaving a clear imprint on headline inflation  a steep jump in consumer energy prices is projected to boost overall pce price inflation which ran at a 3 percent pace in the first quarter to a rate of 4 percent in the current quarter an upward revision of 1 percentage points from our march forecast  meanwhile core inflation has on net come in right in line with our expectations  the core measure for february was 01 percentage point higher than we had expected and for march was 01 percentage point lower  for the first quarter as a whole core pce prices increased at a pace of 2 percent the same pace that we had projected in the last greenbook  we are anticipating a similarsized increase in the current quarter
looking ahead i guess our luck with offsetting errors ran out when it came to the inflation forecast  we accumulated a number of small changes in the key determinants of our inflation projection and for the most part they pointed in the same direction  higher energy costs higher import prices a bit tighter labor and product markets and a slightly lower estimate of the growth of structural productivity suggest somewhat greater upward pressure on price inflation  each of these influences was small but taken together they caused us to revise up our forecast for core pce inflation by 01 percent in both 2007 and 2008  despite these revisions we continue to expect core price inflation to edge down next year from 23 percent this year to 21 percent next year as the effects of higher energy and import prices wane as resource utilization eases a bit and as inflation expectations hold roughly steady
karen will continue our presentation
ms johnson  the basic message from the rest of the global economy is that economic conditions are favorable and appear likely to remain so through the end of next year  although small variations in the basically optimistic outlook are present real gdp growth in the foreign economies seems poised to continue at an average annual rate of about 3 percent throughout the forecast period  inflation risks are present as slack has been reduced in several foreign economies  however we anticipate that central banks abroad will respond further as needed such that inflation abroad will edge up only slightly through the end of 2008  in this forecast round the staff had to contend with a move back up in global crude oil prices and further increases in nonfuel commodities pricesshocks common to the whole global economy  in addition for the us outlook we needed to take account of the depreciation of approximately 2 percent in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period as dave discussed
we have recently revisited the question of whether we could improve upon the forecast for crude oil prices embedded in market futures prices and have convinced ourselves based on empirical evidence that we cannot  as a result our projections for future wti spot oil prices and the average oil import price are shifted up and down over time by fluctuations in spot and futures oil prices  this has been an up forecast round  after reaching a peak around august of last year global oil prices  fell through very early this year and then reversed to trend back up but not smoothly the upward move of oil prices over the intermeeting period was apparently a response to the surprising degree of continued production restraint from opec and heightened concerns about supply from iran iraq and nigeria  the strength in global demand for energy too no doubt provided support for continued elevated prices  in this forecast we also had to take into account a deviation in the usual price spread between west texas intermediate and other grades of oil  reduced refinery activity has led to an unusually large accumulation of crude oil stocks in the midwest the delivery area for wti and depressed its price relative to that for other grades
when we were finalizing the baseline forecast spot and futures prices implied an increase to our projection for wti crude oil in the current quarter of about 450 per barrel relative to the projection in the march greenbook however this change
understates a bit the upward shift in overall oil prices because of the change in spreads  these considerations led us to revise upward the average oil import price in the greenbook for the current quarter about 650 per barrel  we expect that over the forecast period the relative prices of wti and other grades will gradually move back toward normal so our upward revision narrows somewhat in future quarters particularly by the second half of 2008  the baseline forecast reflects the consequences of these higher oil prices for the us economy and the rest of the world  turning points in the ups and downs of oil prices have an uncanny way of happening at the time that we are finishing the greenbooks and such a turning point might have happened again  since the greenbook path was set crude oil prices have moved back noticeably  if we were concluding our forecast today based on yesterdays futures prices we would show an upward revision in the near term of only about half that in the greenbook  for 2008 our upward shift would be about twothirds of that in the greenbook  the effects of this more benign level for oil prices would be slightly positive for real gdp growth both in the united states and abroad  such a lower projected path for oil prices would also slightly lessen the pressures on headline inflation rates that are a feature of the baseline forecast
another element in the forecast worth a brief mention is the upward revision to both core import price inflation and core export price inflation for the second quarter to annual rates of 45 percent and 55 percent respectively  prices for core imports and core exports accelerated in the first quarter as prices for food and industrial supplies particularly fuels and metals surged  metals prices have continued to rise in recent weeks and the increase along with the recent depreciation of the dollar led us to revise up our currentquarter projections  in constructing our forecast for these trade prices we base our projection of the commodityprice component on market futures prices  again we have done recent work to see if a better alternative is available but we have concluded that none is  despite rapid increases in prices of various traded commodities over the past few years the futures markets are implying a path through the end of 2008 that is about flat for an index of nonfuel commodities in combination with our projection for only modest real dollar depreciation and no major changes in overall inflation rates here and abroad such an outlook for commodity prices yields a deceleration in both core import prices and core export prices  our forecast for the increase in these prices in 2008 remains low at 13 percent
although oil prices have been revised up this time their projected path flattens in mid2007  this outlook and the flat projected paths for commodity prices and the dollar imply a waning of the upward push to consumer prices that has resulted from rising oil and commodity prices  consequently in the greenbook forecast only limited further tightening by some foreign central banks is required to contain inflation  that events in these markets may surprise futures traders and us for yet another year with additional commodityprice increases is a major risk to our outlook for inflation  david and i will be happy to take any questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions  president moskow
mr moskow  dave you talked about the slowdown in structural productivity in your
report  you have marked down your estimates for structural multifactor productivity for the
second half of this decade from what you had before  even before that you had a decline from
the first half of the decade to the second half  so i wonder if you could expand a bit on those
comments
mr stockton  certainly  as we have reported at recent meetings we have been
surprised by the extent to which actual productivity has slowed over the past six to eight months
we had been resisting a downward revision in our estimate of structural productivity on the
expectation that we would imminently see a significant weakening in labor demand that would
in essence suggest that more of the slowing was cyclical than appeared to be the case  but the
tension just seemed to be growing greater over time  as i think bill wascher reported in his
chart show back in january our kalman filter models have been suggesting a more substantial
downward revision to structural productivity than we made even in this forecast  some tension
there remains so we thought we needed to get a little better balance  at the same time we have
been surprised on the upside by the strength in labor force participationin particular the
participation of workers 55 years old and older  so it felt as though we needed to make some
minor adjustments here to get a little better balance of risk for both our labor force forecast and
our productivity forecast
now in august when we get the annual revisions were going to have a better idea of
how much of the tension between the income side and the product side over the past year gets
resolved in favor of the income side  in that case maybe we have overreacted by making an
adjustment but it just felt at this point as though the shortfall of productivity relative to our
structural productivity was so much greater than we could explain by normal cyclical behavior
that we had to give at least a nod in the direction that maybe this was telling us something about
slightly weaker structural productivity  i really wanted to wait until we received those figures in
august but it just seemed as though enough evidence against our forecast had accumulated that
we needed at least as i said to nod in that direction
mr moskow  some work has been done on trying to isolate whether these changes
are in the hightech area or in areas across the economy in which people are not getting as much
improvement in the use of new high technology as they did in the past  can you shed any light
on that question
mr stockton  ill let bill jump in if he has any particular observations on that  i
dont think technology alone explains the surprise that weve had in the past year or so on
productivityi dont know of any work that we or others have done that would allow us to parse
out how much of that surprise might have been related to this hightech issue  the bigger
sectoral question in our minds has been related to the behavior of construction employmenta
decidedly nonhightech areawhere we have not seen the falloff that one might have thought
would follow from the decline in residential investment  now it turns out that the work weve
been doing partly at the direction of the chairman suggests that although its a little hard to
understand the construction industry appears to exhibit more labor hoarding than you would
think  the real surprise has been that since the turn of the year construction employment hasnt
fallen off more than it has  but one could look back and say that maybe some of the weakness in
actual productivity reflects a bigger cyclical effect coming from that element  again if one put a
heavy weight on that one might be less inclined to revise down ones estimate of structural
productivity
chairman bernanke  okay  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  in commenting on president moskows
question you mentioned the disconnect between employment and gdp particularly in the
construction area  somehow the lag argument doesnt ring very true to me on that one given
that residential construction has been down for such a long time and i think a lot of the smaller
companies are hard pressed and probably some of them are going into bankruptcy  so could you
elaborate on that aspect of the employment puzzle here
mr stockton  i will just raise the white flag  laughter  if you thought about an
area in which there would be fewer costs to shedding and acquiring labor construction would
probably be right at the top of your list  but the empirical evidence suggests otherwise  again
this is something we have just started working on so i dont necessarily want to buy into it
100 percent  but that effect appears to be in the data and thats all i can say  i had exactly your
reaction when i first saw these results  how can that be  some of itthough we dont think a
major partcould be measurement  that is there may have been more adjustment on that labor
margin that isnt getting picked up in the establishment survey  part of it could be that some of
those firms that have been for example doing residential investment are shifting to
nonresidential investment but we run the regressions on total construction and in total
construction employment we still find the same puzzling results
mr poole  is the gdp number on residential construction put together primarily as a
distributed lag off starts
mr stockton  there are several major components  indeed onethe residential
construction componentis based on a lag off starts both a relatively short lag off singlefamily
starts and a longer lag off multifamily starts  another significant component is additions and
alterations which is based on survey information  this component is not very well measured it
is subject to substantial revision  conceivably once morecomplete counts have occurred we
may find out that perhaps some adjustment was going on there maybe a bigger increase and
therefore more of that employment was in fact occurring in adds and alts than we currently
recognize  that is a significant chunk of overall residential investment
chairman bernanke  president moskow a twohanded intervention
mr moskow  i have just a footnote  a large group of people working this industry are
selfemployed  i do not know to what extent you could separate that out but it too is an important
piece of this puzzle
mr stockton  yes that certainly could be a factor as well
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  one of the surprises noted in the greenbook dave was eci and
compensation in the first quarterthe increases were not as large as you had anticipated  i know
that those numbers bounce around a lot quarter to quarter but my impression has been that overall
they have been coming in somewhat lower than anticipated for a while especially given your
estimate of the nairu  i do not know whether i have that right but if i do what do you think is
going on there
mr stockton  let me answer the firstquarter surprise and then the longerterm
surprise that you are pointing to  we were indeed very surprised by the small increase in eci
hourly compensation in the first quarter  but almost all of that surprise occurred in one
componenta huge drop in contributions to pension plans  we have checked with folks in that
particular area and it looks as though that estimated decline in construction probably reflected
something that happened in the real world  that is the combination of the fact that corporations
had previously raised their contributions to high levels and the improvement in financial markets
both the stock market and the real estate market in preceding years suggests that those plans were in
better financial shape  there was a decline of 30 percent at an annual rate in that particular
component  we do not see that decline as necessarily ongoing or that reduction in payments as an
indication of a lower marginal cost of production so we are not taking a big price signal from that
component of labor compensation
now that is our excuse for the first quarter  looking back over a slightly longer haul
compensation per hour has been running below our models and that could be suggesting a little
more slack in labor markets than we are writing down  we have not adjusted our measures of slack
partly because the surprises on the price side have not been anywhere near as large as those on
wages they have been if anything quite small and not necessarily suggesting that this economy has
a lot more room  but the compensation data taken alone suggest less tightness in the overall
economy than the product markets would
chairman bernanke  we have an intervention from president minehan
ms minehan  not an intervention  a question
chairman bernanke  oh im sorry  let me go then to president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i just want to follow up a bit on the tail end of
the conversation with president poole about residential investment  one of the big changes in your
forecast was the additional markdown of pushing the recovery in residential investment out further
and sustaining a more negative effect on your forecast  my sense is that had a fairly significant
impact going forward  i am curious as to what extent that outcome was really model driven in that
your actual estimation of the fundamentals changed or was it more judgmental  if it resulted from
the fundamentals that were predicted by the model what were the pieces of evidence that were
driving that change or was it just a judgmental thing that is saying it will take longer  can you
elaborate a little on where that came from
mr stockton  it came principally from the fact that we have been gauging our
construction forecast from an expectation that builders would try to adjust production to reduce the
months supply of unsold homes down toward a more normal level over the next couple of years
between the march forecast and this forecast we were surprised 1 by the weakness in the level of
home sales and 2 by the very substantial further increase in the months supply of unsold homes
so to get the inventory of unsold homes back into a more normal relationshipand even then we
are not getting back to where we were in the march forecast in terms of months supply of unsold
homeswe saw a bigger production adjustment as being necessary  now the awkwardness in
relation to your question about the fundamentals is that we actually think that the overhang of
unsold homes is a fundamental even though it is not really in our models of residential construction
those models do not have a special component for the inventory of unsold homes in part because
that factor is much more episodic than it is a normal sort of righthandside variable  so we do view
it as fundamental  we think that what we learned was that a bigger problem is out there a bigger
overhang and we are having it work off  therefore it takes longer to work that off with deeper
production cuts
mr plosser  is the overhang measured as the absolute number of unsold homes or the
ratio of unsold homes to current monthly sales
mr stockton  well you could do it either way  we did not take for example the last
months incredible weakness in newhome sales at face value  we take a sixmonth moving
average calculate what we think the months supply is based on that and have months supply
come back to a more normal level over time  so it is like an inventorysales ratio  the production
adjustments that we have incorporated in this forecast basically bring that inventorysales ratio most
of the way back toward normal by the end of 2008 but not all the way
mr plosser  then what drives the demand for new homes  if it is an inventorysales
ratio you were also making some implicit statement about the forecast of demand
mr stockton  absolutely  we have a very mild upturn in home sales as overall
activity and income recover from this soft period but we do not get the normal kind of pop in
housing  what is unusual in part about this cycle is that in past cycles monetary policy was partly
responsible for driving the decline of demand and then a much easier monetary policy drove a more
significant upturn in sales and that was an important element in bringing about balance  you had
part of the adjustment coming from lower production and part of it being driven by much faster
increases in demand as interest rates fell  in our forecast mortgage rates are drifting up a little from
here so we do not really see the conditions that will generate a substantial turnaround in sales that
might work off this margin of unsold homes more through the demand side  but obviously that
could still happen
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  this works as an intervention as well as a question because it is exactly
along the lines of president plossers questions  first the assumption about inventory and where is
normalthe past ten years through the housing boom have created a normality if you will of very
low inventories as compared with the longerrun inventories  so the question is where is normal
and where do builders want normal to be  how much do they have to do to get back to the level
where they were for the past ten years versus the level that you could figure over a twentyyear or
thirtyyear period  i talked to a group of builders about this a couple of months ago and did not get
a whole lot of feedback from them on where they thought they might like to be although all of
them i am sure are making that calculation for themselves in one way or another in their business
on a daytoday basis  but i think it is hard to say that any given level of inventoryseeing how
much it changed between the past ten years and the ten or twenty before thatis normal with any
confidence  second i have been taking a bit of confidence and maybe this is wrong from the fact
that if you smooth through sales of existing homes which of course are a much bigger volume than
sales of new homes on a threemonth or a sixmonth moving average you do see a dip at the
beginning of this year and then you see it come back a little in the environment of reasonably low
interest rates for prime borrowers and decent interest in terms of mortgage originations and so forth
but obviously not as high as it was  i am thinking that that maybe says something about the demand
side but maybe this is just cockeyed optimism on my part
mr stockton  i certainly would not say that  laughter  i am glad to hear that the
builders you talked to are not giving clear answers to that question because we have been talking to
them as well and have not received clear answers  i think this is an open and unresolved question of
the forecast  we are predicating our forecast or gauging it basically on an expectation that in fact
builders would try to drive months supply back close to where it was on average over the past ten
years as if that had persisted long enough to reflect their desired equilibrium  but that is a big if
and as you note if one wanted to take a twentyyear or thirtyyear average that desired months
supply figure would be higher  so an upside risk to housing would be that there is not as big an
overhang to be worked off as we are currently gauging in this forecast
on the sales of existing homes i guess we too have taken some comfort from the fact that
they stabilized a bit  more recently there was a dropback in existinghome sales and a decline in the
index of pending home sales which has some predictive content for existing homes going forward
so the picture is a little murkier but i do think those data might suggest that although it looks like a
complete free fall in newhome sales you need to factor in the possibility that overall housing
demand is not quite as weak as those figures for newhome sales
ms minehan  anecdotally we were getting some feedbackin new england
anywaythat things are starting to heat up  thats only in relative terms on the highend side
anyway  but who knows
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  we had as you know a trial run in
which participants submitted some projections  in the interest of illuminating the conversation that
we will have in a moment i thought id ask vincent just to say a few words about those projections
mr reinhart2  yesterday afternoon we posted to the secure document server a summary of the economic projections that you submitted  the material should be in front of you with a cover memo from debbie danker  i will use the table directly behind that cover to review briefly the key features of those projections and then i will outline the schedule for the trial run going forward
as shown in table 1 the central tendency of the projections suggests that most of you anticipate that gdp growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit over 2008 and 2009  participants generally anticipate that core pce inflation will edge a little lower over the forecast period and that the unemployment rate will inch up to the vicinity of 4 percent  the federal funds rate path associated with this projection for the economy not shown is fairly flat over this year and next and moves slightly lower in 2009
the width of the 70 percent confidence bands for economic variables suggests a wide range of outcomes for growth inflation and the unemployment rate over the forecast period  as noted by the memo lines the central tendency forecasts prepared for the may meeting relative to the forecast prepared for the january fomc meeting indicate a somewhat weaker path for economic growth in the near term and a somewhat higher trajectory for the unemployment rate  the central tendency for core pce inflation has changed little
in your accompanying description of the key forces shaping the economic outlook most of you cited continued weakness in the housing sectorwith residential construction viewed as likely to remain a drag on growth for some time and the softness in home prices noted as a factor damping the rise in wealth and consumer spending  against this backdrop gdp growth was expected to remain somewhat below trend for a while resulting in a small rise in the unemployment rate it was also noted that labor hoarding in some industries over recent months had likely

2  material used here by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 2
masked an underlying easing in labor market conditions that would become more apparent over the remainder of this year  generally accommodative financial conditions and solid growth abroad were seen as supporting gdp growth  while most participants looked for core pce inflation to edge lower some related that the rise in energy prices and import prices coupled with recent sluggish productivity readings would put upward pressure on prices over the near term
as a group you tended to be a bit more optimistic about the prospects for aggregate supply than the staff  several participants noted that their forecasts were premised on a higher rate of potential output growth than projected in the greenbook owing in part to assessments relative to the staff outlook that labor force participation rates would not decline as much or that structural productivity growth would be stronger  some participants also pointed out that their forecasts incorporated a lower nairu than did the staff outlook
as for the process from here on if you would like to change your forecast in light of the discussion at this meeting or data received since you prepared your projection we ask that you submit your revision to the secretariat by the opening of business tomorrow  the staff will draft a minutesstyle narrative description of the economic projections  this will be a standalone document that will circulate with the draft minutes on the regular schedule  that means you will see a first draft on may 17 a second one on may 22 and a final version on may 24  we ask that you comment on these drafts as if the final version were to be publishedbut it wont be nor will you be asked to vote on the document
chairman bernanke  thank you vincent  i have penciled in some time after the
policy decision for discussion and comments about the process and for the head of the
subcommittee to talk a little about what we will be doing in our communication discussions going
forward  so in the interest of time i would ask people who have questions for vincent to try to
restrict them primarily to the projections themselves and to the economic outlook if that is okay
does anyone have any questions for vincent  if not we can begin our goround  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  my assessment of the economic outlook and the
risks to it is largely unchanged since our last meeting  the data since that meeting have been mixed
on the one hand the very sluggish real gdp growth in the first quarter gives me pause concerning
potential downside risks  much of the firstquarter weakness of course was due to housing and i
really dont see that sector starting to turn around at this point  my homebuilder and banking
contacts report stricter underwriting standards for all mortgages not just subprime ones so
residential investment could remain a significant drag on the economy over the near term as the
greenbook now envisions  indeed whereas the greenbook assumes that national house prices are
flat going forward i am worried that they may actually fall  on the other hand the improved
picture of auto inventories along with some positive glimmers on manufacturing and business
investment suggests that those sectors may prove to be less of a drag on the economy going
forward  with respect to inflation the recent news has also been somewhat mixed with lowerthan
expected readings on core consumer prices and labor compensation offset by higher prices for
energy other commodities and imports
taking a longer view i anticipate real gdp growth over the next two and a half years of
about 26 percent just a bit below my assessment of potential  my forecasts of both actual and
potential growth are a tenth or two stronger than the greenbook forecasts but the basic story is very
similar and the underlying assumptions including the path for the nominal funds rate are
essentially the same  i view the stance of monetary policy as remaining somewhat restrictive
throughout the entire forecast period  the key factors shaping the longerterm outlook include
continued fallout from the housing sector with housing wealth projected to be roughly flat through
2008  given the reduced impetus from housing wealth household spending should advance at a
more moderate pace going forward than over the past few years
this slowdown in consumption is reinforced by moremoderate gains in personal income as
the unemployment rate gradually rises reaching 5 percent in 2009  although i anticipate that the
labor market will remain fairly tight over the next year i do not expect faster compensation growth
to exert significant upward pressure on prices  i expect it instead to restrain profits given that
labors share of income is now at an exceptionally low level  i also anticipate that various
temporary factors that have been boosting inflation such as the runup in owners equivalent rent
and the passthrough of energy prices should dissipate while inflation expectations remain well
anchored  overall im more optimistic regarding inflation than the greenbook and anticipate that
core pce price inflation will edge down below 2 percent after next year
one of the more interesting questions about the outlook as david noted in the questions to
him is how to reconcile the strong labor market performance with the weak growth in output or
equivalently how much of the recent slowdown in productivity growth is likely to persist  and that
is something that we have been thinking about too  over the four quarters of 2006 nonfarm
business productivity rose 16 percent about half as fast as the average pace set from 2000 through
2005  whether these recent lower numbers reflect a transitory drop in growth or a downshift in the
trend rate is an important issue  a lot of excellent research has been done on this topic by staff at
the board and elsewhere in the system  my reading of the evidence at this point is that the recent
decline in productivity growth does largely reflect cyclical factors  i think productivity growth has
fallen significantly below trend because of labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment
to output
we have also been giving close scrutiny to the behavior of the residential construction sector
and productivity in that sector  my staff has done some work on estimating what productivity
growth has been over the past year or so in residential investment and in the nonfarm business
sector outside residential investment  they estimate that essentially all of last years slowdown in
labor productivity growth is due to the behavior of productivity in residential construction  we
estimate that residential construction productivity dropped 10 to 15 percent in 2006 whereas
productivity in the nonfarm business sector outside residential investment was well maintained
exactly why those lags exist again is a mystery to me as well as to david and others
but going forward it seems to us that as the adjustment lags work themselves out
residential construction employment will likely post significant declines and productivity in that
sector and the economy as a whole will rebound  that said the pace of structural productivity
growth may also have declined slightly as the greenbook hypothesizes  relative to the second half
of the 1990s both the pace of productivity growth in the it sector and the pace of investment in
equipment and software have slowed and these factors have probably depressed trend productivity
growth slightly in recent years and are likely to continue depressing it somewhat going forward
but the hypothesis that the recent decline in productivity growth is mainly structural does not seem
to me to square well with the broad range of available evidence  recall that in the 1990s there was
a whole constellation of evidenceincluding a booming stock market robust consumption and
rapid business investmentthat was consistent with a hypothesis of a lasting increase in the rate of
productivity growth  in contrast over the past year or so business investment in equipment has
been very sluggish and more so than seems warranted by the deceleration in business output  so
such weakness could reflect lower assessments by companies of their ability to improve
productivity through the installation of new capital and that is i think consistent with the lower
trend of productivity growth  but you would think that a marked slowdown in secular productivity
growth would also result in downward revisions to the expected paths of future profits and real
wages weakening equity market valuations and crimping consumption growth  i have seen no
signs over the past year that household perceptions of their future wealth accumulation have been
downgraded
in sum the data seem consistent with the view that the recent slowdown in nonfarm
business productivity represents a temporary cyclical drop that is concentrated in residential
construction combined with a modest decline in the trend  so i remain optimistic that the
underlying productivity trend is at or only slightly below 2 percent
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the seventh district have
improved modestly since my last report  the overall pace of business activity is still rather
restrained but we have seen some pickup in our manufacturing sector  the key issues regarding the
national outlook are the same as the ones the last time we met  how will the residential investment
puzzle settle out and can we explain this puzzling weakness in business fixed investment
based on the data that weve received since march and my contact calls this round ive
become somewhat more optimistic about investment and somewhat more pessimistic about
housing  at the same time higher gasoline prices have the potential to weigh on consumer
spending  so on balance our growth projection for 07 and 08 is a bit lower than it was in march
we now think that growth will average moderately short of potential over the remainder of 07 and
then run close to potential in 2008   however our gdp numbers are a bit higher than the
greenbooks reflecting both a smaller shortfall from potential this year and a somewhat higher
assumption about the rate of potential output growth
indeed there has been some good news regarding the nearterm outlook  first the
international outlook continues to improve  many of our contacts noted exceptionally strong
demand from abroad particularly for capital goods  second although weve been actively looking
for spillovers from the problems with subprime mortgages we have not yet seen major effects on
pricing or the supply of credit in other markets  that is not to say that we have not heard of any
effects  one of our directors the cfo of a major national homebuilder noted that tighter
underwriting standards are reducing housing demand somewhat outside the subprime sector
consumers still appear to have ample access to financing  for example the head of gm noted that
banks were making more auto loans with six or sevenyear maturities in order to lower monthly
payments for liquiditystrapped consumers
finally as i noted earlier we feel a bit more confident in our assumption that the weakness
in bfi will turn out to be relatively transitory  i dont want to make too much out of one months
noisy data but the latest readings on capital good orders and the pmi purchasing managers index
were encouraging and most of the comments from my business contacts have been positive in this
regard  the impression i have from these discussions is that the pause in investment spending is
showing early signs of ending but this is very early and we clearly need to keep monitoring
developments carefully
beyond the nearterm cyclical developments the changes in structural productivity in the
greenbook highlight an important source of risk to the longerrun outlook for sustainable non
inflationary growth as janet just discussed  there is a lot of uncertainty about the components of
structural productivity  in our view we havent seen enough evidence yet to mark down structural
productivity as much as the greenbook has  consequently our estimate of potential output growth
is a bit higher than that of the greenbook
with regard to inflation the incoming information has caused the forecasts from our
indicator models to come down a bit  they now project that core pce prices will rise 2 percent
this year and 21 percent in 08  but we do not see any progress beyond that  if we carry our
models out to 09 they have inflation staying at 21 percent higher than my preferred range
furthermore i see some upside risks to this forecast  neither our gdp projection nor the
greenbooks generates any meaningful resource slack over the projection period and then there are
the higher costs for energy and other commodities and increases in import prices  so we will be
relying heavily on stable expectations to keep inflation in check  i believe we are currently
achieving some implicit tightening of policy by keeping rates on hold during this period of sluggish
activity but this restraint will wane if the real economy returns to potential by early next year as we
expect  so i continue to think that the risks to price stability dominate the risks to sustainable
growth
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman last time i reported a sense that the international economy
was hot that our domestic economy was cold and that the regional economy of the eleventh
district was just about right  i concluded my comments by saying that we were in treacherous
waters in terms of the us economy navigating between the scylla of inflation and the charybdis
of a slowdown in growth  like president yellen i dont have much change to report but i do want
to comment in very brief order on a couple of aspects that my two predecessors commented on
as far as the international economy is concerned we see continued expectations for higher
growth and a different mindset beginning to set in  you saw that i believe in the french elections
even italian consumer and business confidence is at a tenyear high or sixyear high depending on
which measurement you use  you also see it reflected in various measures of port congestion
charter rates for ships and profit contributions to us multinationals  by the way the contacts that
we talk to bill are making a real effort to ferret it out and have a sense that there should be more
push or oomph from abroad than they are getting domestically  you still have to prune those
reports carefully  you see it in commodity prices  the bottom line from the standpoint of the
dallas fed is that were seeing a tightening of capacity utilization in the rest of the world which is
somewhat vexing for us operators because it limits our firms abilities to cut costs by shipping
production abroad  nonetheless the rest of the world economy remains hot
i have just a couple of comments about the united states  when i talk to the rails the
airlines the express delivery logistic companies the middleincome consumption sectors such as
retailers or those that sell into those sectors i am hearing increasing reports of weaker demand and
lower expectations than i was hearing at the last meeting in all but one sector which is the
entertainment sector  advertising revenues for the networks continue to stay high and by the way
visits to theme parks are at a record high driven largely by wealthy foreigners who are finding them
to be a tremendous bargain  on the housing front i have been bearishmore bearish than anybody
at this table  i remain so and like president yellen and i believe president moskow i am more
concerned than i was before  we can go through the numbers but i think it is best expressed by the
ceo of one of the five big builders who said that in march he was arguing internally with his board
that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines  there is
significant inventory and the qualification of buyers is becoming a very vexing issue  i suspect that
this situation has yet to run its course  i am also hearing continued reports despite layoffs and a
slowing economy of continued tightness of highly skilled labor and continued price pressure on that
front  finally in terms of the domestic economy we are benefiting from a weaker dollar in terms of
tourism flows and also the highend retailers most of which are in president geithners district and
oneneiman marcusin my own district  other than that i have nothing to add on the us
economy
i want to talk about inflation for a minute  the datawhether core pce or overall core
cpi or even the trimmed mean which we focus on in dallasseem to be indicating a tempering of
pressures  so we have some meat on the bones of our expectation or i should say our hope that
some deceleration of inflation pressures would manifest itself  but in talking to my business
contacts i would sayif you will forgive a terrible reversal of biblical scripturethat though the
flesh may be willing the spirit is weak  what i mean is that even though they would like to believe
the numbers in terms of their own behavioral patterns and the way they are positioning their
management they feel enormous threats to their margins coming from slow volume growth and
coming from increasing cost pressures in that they allocate tasks globally  and their first reaction is
to see how they could change the pricing structure domestically  chemicals are reporting that a 3 to
5 percent price action that was taken at the beginning of the year is sticking  my contact from a
large producer of food products said that they are shifting their overall model away from focusing
on unitvolume expansion to pricing and even a ubiquitous brand like starbucks is moving away
from the number of transactions to figure out how to price more aggressively or to restructure the
size of their containers as are many food product producers  the large consumer paper products
reported that they were budgeting zero percent price inflation at the beginning of the year and have
redone their budget to price at 3 to 4 percent  if i had to pick a word mr chairman in terms of the
mood of our companies regarding the us economy i would say that its somewhat dyspeptic  its
not a very pleasant mood  they feel a little indigestion because of the margin pressure that theyre
getting and limited relief in terms of what theyre able to pull out in volume expansion
i am in an unusual position of coming from what i believe reading the beige book and
looking at the data is a district that continues to significantly outperform the rest of the economy
although we have slowed somewhat yet when you look at the histograms i have the lowest forecast
for gdp for this year  so i am the most pessimistic at the table in terms of shortterm economic
growth and on the inflation front i would just resort to a ronald reaganism which is that we need
to trust but verify  in short i would not be surprised to see disappointing growth in the second
quarter much more disappointing than in the greenbooks forecast nor would i be surprised to see
higher core pce inflation sustaining itself than i am hearing from some of my colleagues and from
the staff  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  the anecdotal reports that i have accumulated
since we last met are almosti guess i should eliminate almostare unambiguously on the soft
side  i emphasize soft which i think is a better word than weak except perhaps with my
trucking industry contact who says that volume in both march and april is down 6 percent over a
year ago and does not know exactly what is happening  trucking company bankruptcies are up
sharply24 percent above a year ago  truck shipping rates are weakfor the first quarter they
were up just slightly year over year and in the second quarter they were down a couple of
percentage points  my contact says that the volume declines are general across the country and
widespread across industry segments  the company has reduced capacity and will continue to do
so and others in the industry are doing the same thing  so there is a big inventory of used trucks
sitting out there in the market and some of these trucks are being sold abroad
in the package delivery business are fedex and ups  i mention the names of those
companies because it is obvious who is in the package delivery business you cannot really disguise
that  laughter  fedex says that the business is coming in a little below plan and that its volume in
lessthantruckload business is flat  others are down  domestic express volume is down 2 percent
year over year  the ground package network is growing substantiallya lot of that is diversion
from the express business because ground delivery is cheaper  fedex may be delaying some of its
expansion projects putting them off three to twelve monthsnot fundamentally changing its long
run expansion plans but delaying some capital expenditures which are expected to be down 10
percent from the earlier plan for this year but still up 10 percent over the previous fiscal year  my
contact expressed confidence that the slowdown is temporary he expects a pickup in the august
september timeframe  fedex has no difficulty in hiring the people the company needs except in
accounting and audit fields  i heard essentially the same story from ups  ground volume there is
up about 2 percent year over year  ups is having to discount rates after putting through price
increases last year  capex is up somewhat in 07 compared with 06  profit margins are under
huge pressure the pricing environment is very competitive
i developed a new contact in the qsr industry  now you may not know what the qsr
industry is but it stands for quick serve restaurants  other people call it fast food  laughter  in
the restaurant business the casual dining industry is a more discretionary kind of outlay and that
traffic is down 7 percent year over year  traffic in the qsr industry is down 5 to 6 percent  this is
across the industry all the different companies in that business  they have been putting through
price increases of roughly 3 percent  so in terms of dollar volume their comps are downin the
3 percent to 4 percent area
my contact from a large us bank notes that the economy is in a soft patch that may be
extended for a while and that business cash flow and balance sheets are solid  there is something of
a mystery as to why capex is not stronger  from proprietary internal data on credit card usage i
learned that the growth of credit card usage is slowing it had been about 5 percent year over year
and is down to 4 percent  on an early reading of the april data distinctly weak was the
comment  particularly nonauto sales may have declinedi guess we get the retail sales number
on friday  it is likely that april retail sales are weak  talking about credit demand a lot of the
demand for ci loans according to my contact is really not the standard ci type of thing but
instead is being driven primarily by merger and acquisition activity hedge funds private equity and
state and local government borrowing  credit quality remains very high
on the outlook my take is that the economy has slowed and the real issue is whether we
have a temporary soft patch from which the economy will recover on its own or whether this is the
beginning of a cumulative weakness  it is often the case particularly if you think about some of the
models of business cycles that weakness after a time can feed on itself and become cumulative  i
do not think that we know enough to be able to make really a solid estimate on that  i would note
that we likely do not have an inventory complication which has been so important in past business
cycle developments  inventories seem to be pretty well controlled on the whole  also output is
certainly being supported by the stock market and by a weaker dollar  i would also note the
unabated growth in the monetary aggregates both mzm and m2we see no sign of traditional
downturn behavior from those measures  i will stop there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you mr chairman  conditions in new england seem broadly
supportive of the continued expansion of the region at about the pace of the nation as a whole
perhaps because the pace of national activity has slowed somewhat and so the region seems to be
lagging less though i do think there is a bit of a brighter tone to economic activity  i certainly do
not want to overemphasize that however as concerns do linger about the strength of job growth and
the housing market among other things
two matters came up in our rounds of gathering data and anecdotes around the region
first although growth in overall labor costs in the region is moderate relative to that of the nation
concerns continue about the cost and availability of skilled labor  respondents are also increasingly
concerned about other input costsoil copper zinc other metals and chemicalsand report that
they are attempting to pass on higher costs within the supply chain or directly to consumers and are
succeeding in many cases  we have not heard much locally yet about the effect of three dollars a
gallon for gasoline and i am hoping the refinery outages that apparently caused this uptick prove
temporary enough not to dent regional demand or to increase price pressures  however the general
rise in primary energy costs is not particularly reassuring  second while the residential real estate
data for the region continue to be downbeat in terms of permits starts yearoveryear sales and
price trends anecdotesparticularly as they regard highend markets as i noted beforeoffer
some hope that the spring picture for sales of existing homes will be brighter when all the data are
in  i had a comment in here about spring weather but that turned yesterday so i wont make that
comment  laughter
the incoming data since the last committee meeting contained some pluses and minuses
that by and large offset one another  thus our forecast in boston which is quite close to the
greenbook and similar to other forecasts around the table has not changed an awful lot  in short
the economy appears to have made what one hopes is the final stepdown in overall growth from its
unsustainable momentum of only a year or so ago and is in the process of settling in at a pace that
will gradually accelerate over this year to slightly below potential in 08 and 09  this forecast
assumes that the effect of the housing bust begins to subside by midyear and that business and
consumer confidence remains strong enough to support continued hiring consumption and
business investment  it also assumes that strength in the rest of the world buoys corporate profits
and foreign consumption of our exports and combined with a slowly declining dollar adds at least
marginally to us growth  all of this occurs with a continuation of very accommodative financial
markets that both sustain household wealth and ease borrowing costs and provide a haven for
foreign investment flows  finally the current boost in energy costs proves temporary and inflation
subsides gradually as unemployment moves up slightly reflecting the output gap created by a year
or more of slightly subpotential performance  looking at the data we received on other projections
through 09 our forecast fell within the central tendency in all the areas but i think that we see
inflation as somewhat more persistent than others doalong the lines of the greenbook  in fact
this forecast sounds pretty good to me as an outcome if it works out this way and i have even begun
to think versus where i was at the last meeting that the risks around both sides of this forecast may
be a little smaller
on the growth side the big question involves spillovers from the housing bust and possibly
the problems with subprime adjustablerate mortgages but we have been expecting to see spillovers
for some time and they are yet to emerge in any real way  they still might and we like the
greenbook authors have marked down our forecast for residential investment in 07 based on
incoming data  but i am inclined to think that broader market and economic spillovers get less
likely over time  in fact as i noted before maybe there is some levelingoff in sales of existing
homes if we smooth through the monthtomonth variation in the data  credit restraints could well
damp the participation of subprime borrowers in home purchases but low mortgage rates ought to
support prime borrowers and we see evidence for this in discussions with local banks and certainly
all the advertisements in newspapers and on television that are focusing on the theme that now is the
time to borrow because mortgage rates are low and maybe they will not stay that way for long  so
we thinki think anywaythat we have some reason to believe that through this year home
buying may help keep home prices and equity positive or perhaps neutral contributors to household
wealth  indeed assuming that gasoline prices edge off their current high levels and that equity
markets continue on an upward pace there is at least some possibility on the upside for consumer
spending
another aspect to the growth forecast that concerned me at our last meeting was the
unusually slow pace of business investment in equipment and software  given the underlying
fundamentals of robust corporate profits cash reserves and a declining user cost especially for
hightech goods we would have expected faster growth  i am still concerned here especially as
such spending patterns could augur poorly for continued hiring but i find the mostrecent data on
orders and shipments and the ism survey encouraging although as president moskow mentioned
one should not take a lot of confidence from a single months data  so all in all it seems to me
anyway that the downside risks around growth in our forecast are a bit less
on the inflation front i remain concerned that the forecast is just a bit too perfect  without
too extended a growth slump unemployment rises slightly and inflation falls slowly  we have not
done the work that san francisco has on slicing and dicing productivity and i found janets
comments very interesting  i also am very much in agreement with her and others perspective that
the level of underlying structural productivity growth may not be declining to the degree that the
greenbook authors seem to think it might  however if what seems to be a cyclical low continues
unemployment could well be sticky  both the recent increase in energy and raw material costs and
the burgeoning growth in the rest of the world could increase resource pressures at the same time
that the dollar continues its slow decline  all of this taken together could be a recipe for
accelerating rather than decelerating inflation  as ive noted before i really have no problem with
stable inflation around its current low level  what does concern me however is the potential for
acceleration  in that regard the recent small moderation in core data was welcome though certainly
not sufficient to ease this concern entirely
in sum i remain ready to bet on the baseline forecast  i think it is about as good as we can
hope for  there continue to be risks on both sides but at this point i would not weigh them equally
being wrong on the inflation side could be a more difficult place to be  that is if growth falters it
is clear what to do but if inflation should accelerate it might take a while and be quite costly to
remedy  thus i would continue to favor policy that incorporates a bit of insurance  but we will get
to that later  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  fifth district economic activity continues to
be mixed  our manufacturing indicators continued to drift lower in the past few weeks
apparently diverging from the national trend  this may be because furniture and textiles are
particularly weak and these industries are a significantly greater share of our activity than of
activity elsewhere  respondents expectations regarding future manufacturing activity remained
upbeat but had drifted a bit lower  after two bad months readings on the districts retail sector
have returned to neutral helped by a sharp turnaround in big ticket sales  retail employment and
wage indexes rose significantly as well and expectations for future demand increased sharply
for services firms outside the retail sector our index has moderated a bit over the past three
months though it remains positive and measures of expected demand have held up quite well
housing markets in our district are typically busiest this time of year as elsewhere and contacts
are reporting softer overall sales this year as you might expect  having said that i continue
however to hear reports that homes priced below 250000 or above 700000 are selling well
we hear reports of a lack of inventory close to dc although president lockhart has a property
for sale you might be interested in  laughter
mr lockhart  if anyone is interested please see me  laughter
mr lacker  commercial real estate activity generally remains solid although some
observers expressed concern about the sustainability of the quite strong pace of office
construction in northern virginia  our survey measures of manufacturingprice trends seem to
have moderated since the beginning of the year consistent with sluggish demand in that sector
on the services side price trends seem to have declined somewhat since the first half of last
year although measures of services prices have been choppy and trendless over the past few
months as a whole
turning to the national economy housing news has been disappointing but news about
business investment and manufacturing has been encouraging  however the overall outlook
hasnt changed terribly much since our last meeting  housing begins to stabilize in the second
half of this year business investment in equipment and software picks up and consumer
spending remains relatively healthy  as a result i expect real growth to return to trend in 08
although my outlook broadly agrees with that of the greenbook there are some minor
differencesbut i should emphasize that they are minor  first i remain a tad more optimistic
about trend growth  im expecting something closer to 2 than to 2  second i still think that
residential investment will bottom out in the middle of the year rather than continue to slide into
08  of course it is quite difficult to have a lot of confidence in any one scenario for the housing
market in part because the recent data have been fairly choppy  the figures for homes sales
which late last year suggested that housing demand had stabilized now suggest that demand may
be taking another step downward  if so this would increase the size of the cumulative reduction
in starts relative to newhome sales that will be needed to work off the inventory overhang  its
very hard to know however just how far housing activity needs to fall before it comes back into
stable alignment with income and preferences  but my hunch is that the drag on growth will not
last quite as long as the greenbook says and i still see reasonably good prospects for stability in
the housing sector in the second half of this year  i also think that the housing correction will
have only limited effects on spending outside residential investment  in particular im a bit
more optimistic than the greenbook about household spending
as for inflation the greenbook now has us waiting until the third quarter of 08 before
we see a moderation in core inflation  even then we get only 01 percent  i would view this
outcome as fairly disappointing  but if i had been asked for an unconditional forecast i
probably would have submitted something a lot like that  instead we were asked for a projection
conditional on what in our judgment would be an appropriate monetary policy  so the
projection i submitted has core pce inflation at 18 percent next year and 16 percent in 2009
under what in my judgment would be an appropriate monetary policy we use the chairmans
july testimony to announce that the fomcs objective is for pce inflation to average
1 percent and that the committee intends to reduce inflation to that level within two years
while such an announcement would not necessarily shift inflation expectations immediately
downward i project that consistent communications from committee members accompanied by
further rate increases when downside growth risks abate later this year would bring expectations
into line with our objective by early next year  although growth would be weaker this year than
in my unconditional forecast it would ultimately return to trend in 2008 and the properly
measured sacrifice ratio would turn out to be significantly smaller than is often assumed or
inferred from standard phillips curve estimates  i mention this scenario simply to reiterate that i
believe that theres a feasible alternative to the hypothesis that inflation will settle in around
2 percent or higher unless we engineer a substantial output gap
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the economy from the perspective of the
fourth district isnt materially different from the way i heard dave describe national conditions
manufacturers in the district generally report modest but steady growth  in particular metals
producers and their suppliers report strong orders and production  my business contacts are
telling me that capital investment is a bit soft but it should not at this point pose a serious
problem for the overall economy
ive had several meetings with homebuilders throughout my district in the past few
weeks and they confirmed some of the information that we see in the national datasales are
still very anemic and the inventory of unsold homes remains quite high  they also shared some
information that is not easy to pull from the national indicators  for example sales of starter and
lowerend homes are particularly slow in part because lending standards have been significantly
tightened  this means that there has been a shift in the composition of homes sold toward the
upper end of the price spectrum causing the reported salesprice data to be a little inflated  the
builders i spoke with assure me that price discounts are occurring and that the discounts have
been substantial  likewise i am told that appraisers are increasingly being asked by lenders to
do whatever possible to appraise the properties relative to current market conditions and to
discount price information from the historical comparables  my contacts are also saying that the
expectation that home prices are going to fall further has been keeping some buyers on the
sidelines for now  i also hear that when possible residential contractors are shifting resources to
nonresidential projects  some nationally publicly traded home construction companies are
completing houses and selling them for a loss in some markets just so that they can exit those
markets more quickly  what i take away from my conversations with homebuilders and lenders
is that the national data may not yet fully have caught up with the poor conditions in the
residential construction sector and further those closest to the markets are betting that any
semblance of a recovery is still a long way off
this information had an influence on the economic projections that i submitted for
todays meeting  like the greenbook which as a consequence of more weakness in residential
construction has shaved an additional 05 percentage point off gdp growth in the latter half of
this year i have marked down my expectations for growth in 2007  my projection sees a little
more growth relative to what i see in the greenbook as we move into 2008 and 2009 although i
do see slower economic growth as an obvious risk to my outlook  im especially concerned
about the possibility of some spillover from the housing sector to the business investment
outlook
my inflation projection calls for a slightly more optimistic trend in core pce than what i
see in the greenbook  i had difficulty endorsing a threeyear projection that doesnt assume that
our policies are going to be positioned so that we eventually bring core pce inflation back below
2 percent if only just below  so my inflation projection represents my interpretation of
appropriate monetary policynamely one that will bring core pce in under 2 percent  my
economic projection is therefore based on a federal funds rate path that is very similar to the
greenbook baseline a constant path over the projection period but i have assumed a slightly
more optimistic price path for oil  given karens comments this morning i am a little more
comfortable with that assumption  i also have slightly more potential than the greenbook does
so with these two assumptions i do have a slightly lower path for inflation than the greenbook
does  obviously these assumptions are not made with great conviction and inflation may
continue to track just north of 2 percent  if it does we do risk conditioning expectations to this
level and that is an outcome that i would not welcome
i had an opportunity just a few weeks ago to spend a day with paul volcker who visited
cleveland  on the subject of inflation he reminded me that in his experience big inflations start
out as a tolerance of modest inflations  once inflation expectations drag their anchor a little its
difficult and costly to get them reanchored and this i think remains the biggest risk that we
face as a committee  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  the nearterm outlook for the third district
is moderate growth going forward  the major source of the strength in the district continues to
be employment growth and nonresidential construction is fairly stable and modestly healthy
however manufacturing continues to be sluggish and residential construction weak
job growth has picked up considerably in our district having grown at 09 percent at an
annual rate in the past few months  unemployment rates have fallen in the region and the labor
market in pennsylvania in particular has been especially strong  to get a better handle on labor
market conditions in our last business outlook survey we asked a panel of firms whether they
had experienced problems filling jobs in the past three months because applicants didnt have
sufficient qualifications  remarkably more than twothirds of our firms said that they had
trouble with this and that the percentage has been growing since we first started asking the
question three years ago
the strength in the regional labor markets is reflected in the rebound in our staffs
indexes of leading indicators of economic activity in the three states in our district especially in
pennsylvania where the index is predicting stronger growth over the remaining three quarters of
the year  an area of stability in our regions economy has been the ongoing modest strength in
nonresidential construction  the growth in this sector has recently been largely in
noncommercial constructionhospitals education buildings and so forth  however general
commercial vacancy rates in philadelphia have been falling steadily and the absorption rate in
center city is nearly at a record high  with regard to manufacturing growth is stalled
according to our april manufacturing survey our general activity index is close to zero or just
mildly positive as it has been since late last year  both new orders and shipments are close to
zero as they were  further in april the index of future capital expenditures was down
somewhat and below the averages that we have been seeing in most expansions  the only bright
spot was the significant bumpup in our future activity index which signaled that morerobust
activity is anticipated by our survey participants  it also comes as no surprise that residential
construction remains weak in the district and housing permits have continued to decline as the
value of residential construction contracts has as well  also there seems to be little or no
appreciation in house prices  on the inflation front in the district prices paid and prices
received by manufacturers have moderated a bit  further retailers are reporting very little
change in prices over the past few months  in summary the third district is growing slowly
and our staff projection is for modest growth going forward  labor market fundamentals appear
strong but we have yet to see any sign of the pickup in manufacturing that some of the national
numbers indicate
on the national level since the last meeting i have actually become a bit more
comfortable with the economic situation  while i say that i am more comfortable thats a
relative not an absolute statement  the most recent months readings on core inflation were
welcome but i think that caution and vigilance are still the order of the day  indeed the
greenbook authors as weve noted seem to have been revising their forecast of core inflation
upward slightly over the past several months rather than downward and that to me is a bit
disturbing even if the numbers dont change a whole lot
news that has made me more comfortable with the projection of a somewhat quicker
return to something closer to trend growth in the second half of the year is the recent strength in
durable goods orders and the ism numbers which are indicating that manufacturing has picked
up  further recent strength in manufacturing was broadly based and the output of business
equipment was strong  along this dimension i am in agreement with the latest forecast of the
board staff  however these reports represent only one month of data as people have said and
although they are consistent with a modest bounceback in the second quarter there is still
substantial uncertainty  i hope that in the coming months those data will be reinforced as new
data come in but again at this point that is only wishful thinking  i would add though that my
business contacts particularly in the financial sector continue to report to me that business loans
are strong ci loans are strong demand is strong for loans and balance sheets and firms still
look good  so they see things as looking good from their perspective but that positive news is
not really showing up in some of these other numbers at least as yet  so im a bit puzzled by
that  furthermore job growth and personal income growth appear to be on solid footing and i
find myself increasingly puzzled by the weakness in the labor market as portrayed by the
greenbook forecast  the strength in personal income along with a rebound in asset markets
leads me to view consumption as somewhat healthier going forward than the greenbook sees it
those circumstances coupled with the more positive news on investment to which i just alluded
lead me to view closertotrend growth as the best forecast and therefore to have a little more
optimism in my outlook for the second half of the year and into 08  that is reflected in the
forecast that i submitted
that said i realize there are significant risks to this return to trend growth  the biggest
risk remains housing  the extreme fluctuations in weather over the past four to five months have
made discerning trends a lot more difficult and im not sure exactly how much seasonal
adjustment factors are bouncing the numbers around and making it harder to disentangle effects
inventories of housing as we have talked about remain extremely high and there is very little
signal of a pickup in demand at least as yet  however im a little skeptical that this sector will
continue to subtract a full percentage point of real growth from the forecast as the greenbook
suggests  im a little more optimistic than that  i remain optimistic in part because i think real
mortgage rates remain relatively low  i see strong income growth continuing and i am
increasingly less concerned actually about the spillover from subprime markets  so i can
envision housing demand strengthening a bit more than is implied in the greenbook and that
leads to less of a subtraction going forward
on the inflation front im a bit less worried than last time but far from sanguine  the
last core pce inflation number was obviously very encouraging at something close to zero but
again we have to be very careful in extrapolating out one months data  as i said before the
greenbook authors seem to be inching up their forecast of core inflation or at least pushing the
decline out further into the future and that concerns me a bit  i believe inflation is still too high
inflation expectations are stable but they are too high as well and we need to bring that rate
down  thus we need to be vigilant here and continue with a somewhat restrictive policy
in regard to my forecast im not going to say much  i just assure you that without
collusion president lackers view of the forecast and how it evolves is very similar to mine  so
rather than repeat what he said i will just let his comments largely speak for mine  i have a
slightly faster return to trend growth partly because my productivity estimates are somewhat
higher  i thought janet yellens comments about her productivity analysis were quite thoughtful
and i appreciate them  the optimal monetary policy or at least my preferred path for monetary
policy might include some tightening if trend growth returns more quickly than we had
indicated  but indeed my forecast for core pce was actually down to 17 percent by 2009  ill
stop there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i gave a fairly detailed summary of the
districts economy last time and it hasnt changed a great deal since then  so ill be fairly brief
the labor markets in the region remain fairly tight they have not loosened at all since our last
meeting  our manufacturing sector continues to show strength  our agricultural sector
continues to show strength  housing is the one area that as in other parts of the country has
shown weakness as inventories have built but we havent seen dramatic declines in prices at this
point and we will watch that as others are watching it within their regions
on the national outlook we see that the economy will continue to grow at something
below trend  were a little more optimistic than the greenbook but the point is that we should
see the economy grow below trend  for all the reasons that others have said we expect inflation
to moderate but reasonably slowly over the next eighteen months  therefore anticipating the
next discussion i would say that as a policy group we need to be resolute in our own policies in
terms of holding our positions fairly firm  so ill leave it at that until we get to the policy
discussion mr chairman  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  my outlook for the economy which is
essentially for sustained growth near trend and for a modest diminution of core inflation over
time hasnt changed appreciably  to be sure i have marked down my forecast for this year
largely in recognition of realitythat is the weak first quarter and i anticipate some further
sluggishness in the second quarter as well  but after that i expect growth to accelerate to near
trend  underpinning that anticipated performance is productivity improvement of something like
2 percent a year or maybe a little less and employment gains in the neighborhood of 06 to
08 percentage point per year  on the demand side i expect sustained increases in consumer
spending in business investment including structures and in net exports  i dont think the
outlook for the housing sector has really changed appreciably recently at least relative to what i
had been expecting  given that inventory levels were and are still high i think that it will be
some time before we see any meaningful improvement in residential construction  my
confidence in this general view of the outlook is heightened by my interpretation of history  the
economy grew 3 percent or better over the four years from 2003 through 2006  more important
and more broadly if you think about the performance of the economy over the past two and a
half decades it hasnt been wise to make major bets against sustained healthy growth  so thats
what im really expecting
as for inflation because i view the current stance of monetary policy as moderately
restrictiveand the basis for that is some versions of the taylor rule estimates of the real
federal funds rate relative to its equilibrium and some rules of thumb that we havei do expect
that core inflation will gradually slow from here assuming that we maintain the approximate
stance of policy that we have adopted  i think that another reason is that some of the uptick in
core inflation was transitory  i would add that if you look at the latest three six and
twelvemonth increases in core cpi or core pce you do in fact see some waning of inflation
of course the waning is due in part to the favorable numbers we got in march but it doesnt
appear to be exclusively due to the march numbers  in any event if inflation is going to slow it
has to be in the latest numbers  laughter  i mean there is no other way for that to occur  with
that i will conclude
chairman bernanke  thank you for the arithmetic  laughter
mr stern  sometimes the obvious escapes me  laughter
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  since the last meeting aggregate
economic activity in the sixth district has expanded moderately  employment momentum in
most areas of the district continues to exceed that of the nation overall  florida is our exception
most areas of florida now lag the nation  similarly the housing downturn as measured by sales
and permits remains less severe in the district than for the nation except for much of florida
the housing downturn in florida has shown little sign of bottoming out as builders continue to
expect even lower levels of construction  permit issuance continues in steep decline down over
50 percent from march a year ago  we are not inclined to suggest that there is significance for
the nation as a whole in the florida developments  we have heard anecdotal views from florida
that there was a runup in speculative activity in the secondhome market in 2004 and 2005
buyers were bidding up prices in anticipation of flipping properties at higher prices  so florida
is idiosyncratic  it is idiosyncratic also in the states ongoing insurance cost problem related to
hurricane risk  however in the atlanta region the conversations weve had with homebuilders
about the housing market raised concern of a steepening decline in sales of new homes  atlanta
has generally tracked the nation so we are carefully watching housingsector developments in
georgia particularly in atlanta
despite these negatives in the housing sector we continue to find only limited evidence
of spillover from the residential real estate adjustment to other sectors of the regional economy
labor markets appear to have remained very tight in the district  the measured unemployment
rate is around 4 percent for the district versus 44 percent nationally  even the demand for
skilled building tradesmen appears strong as buildersand this may be relevant to the earlier
discussionseem to be taking the opportunity to upgrade the quality of their staffs  trends in
state sales tax revenue support the view that consumer spending has been relatively unaffected
by the housing downturn  again the exception is florida where sales tax revenues in the first
quarter were substantially below yearago levels
our perspective on the national economy is that significant uncertainty remains about the
overall outlook for 2007 and for the path of inflation  our economic staff uses three models to
forecast the key macroeconomic measures  our average forecast for real gdp growth is
generally in line with the greenbook forecast and neither suggests that a recession is a risk
there are minor differences between our composite forecast and the greenbook on
unemployment  the only significant difference is the declining path of inflation in the
greenbook versus our inflation forecast that holds steady around 23 percent for the forecast
period  so to summarize we harbor greater doubt than the board staff that the inflation rate will
come down as projected in 2007
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  our outlook has changed
very little  as in march we see the expansion continuing with growth moving back up to
potentialwe see potential around 3 percentlater this year  this view rests on the familiar
expectations  housing stabilizes relatively soon without a major drop in prices investment
spending strengthens somewhat as the temporary factors holding it down recede and positive
fundamentals reassert themselves consumption moderates a bit but continues to be supported by
strong income growth the saving rate moves up but only modestly and slowly and external
demand remains strong  we still expect inflation to moderate gradually to a rate just below
2 percent for the core pce by the end of 08  we view the recent numbers as somewhat
reassuring  recent data in general have provided a bit more comfort for this scenario  on
balance the downside risks to growth have diminished a bit  the risk that inflation will fail to
moderate sufficiently however remains significant and material  but in general the overall
outlook in our view hasnt changed that much
now our forecast assumes that we hold the fed funds rate where it is for a while  our
expected path is above the markets but below the greenbooks  were below the greenbook
because although our expected forecast is really similar we attach somewhat greater weight to
alternative scenarios that suggest slower growth  the recent growth numbers have been on
balance encouraging and the markets are a bit more confident about the outlook than they were
but i still think the downside risks to growth are significant  housing could still surprise on the
downside and we could see a deeper more protracted contraction in activity and of course
broadly based moresubstantial declines in prices  consumption could be weaker for this reason
or because the saving rate rises for other reasons such as pessimism about longrun income
growth  the household sector is substantially more leveraged than it was and it has less of a
cushion to absorb shocks and therefore presents some risk of amplifying rather than mitigating
broader weakness in the economy  although a bit better than it was in march the investment
outlook is still a bit tenuous and it seems unlikely to be a substantial source of strength if
broader weakness in demand in the rest of the economy materializes  the most rapidly growing
parts of the world are growing well above potential and face rising inflation and substantial
assetprice inflation and i think the authorities there are generally starting tentatively to tighten
policy more significantly
on the inflation front we still face substantial uncertainty about what is happening to
underlying trends and how they will evolve  the broader inflation environment is if anything
less benign than it has been over the past three quarters with inflation accelerating a little outside
the united states energy and commodity prices continuing to show signs of rapid demand
growth the dollar potentially weakening further compensation here firming a bit and
productivity growth probably staying a bit below what we thought was trend  in this context
with inflation still running about 2 percent inflation expectations could drift up
continuing on the risks for a bit i still think we live with a significant risk of a sharp
deterioration in financial markets  credit spreads other risk premiums low levels of implied
volatility and the strength of asset prices in many parts of the worldall imply a level of
confidence in ongoing stable growth and low inflation that seems a bit implausible  in addition
the low level of long forward rates seems hard to reconcile with the strength of demand growth
outside the united states suggesting that much of the world is likely to need to move further
toward tighter monetary policy  as financial conditions exert more restraint on demand growth
globally we could see a rapid unwinding of this long period of very benign assessment of
fundamental risks  we of course face some risk of policy actions here in the form of trade or
investment protection  this risk against the backdrop of some uncertainty about the strength of
productivity growth going forward might make the rest of the world less comfortable financing
our stilllarge external balance on the favorable terms that have prevailed thus far
on the longerterm outlook for potential in the united states we are sticking with our
forecast of 3 percent but we have altered the mix a bit just as the greenbook has in some sense
however we feel a little less comfortable with our basic view about potential  we lowered our
productivity growth assumption a bit to 225 for the nonfarm business sector and raised our
estimate of trend hours a bit  if potential is lower than were assuming then we are less likely to
see the moderation of inflation that we currently expect but we would expect a lower path for
output growth as well  at this stage however in view of the strength in income growth that
weve seen earning expectations and other measures were reluctant to embrace a more
negative view about growth in potential
on balance in view of these risks i favor staying where we are for a while  i dont think
there is a very strong case for tightening policy or for inducing a significant rise in market
expectations about the path of the fed funds rate going forward nor do i think now that were at
risk of being too tight  so in general i think the best choice for us is to continue to lean against
the expectation that we will move to reduce rates soon  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  it is 1030  why dont we take a twenty
minute coffee break and adjourn until about 1050  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  lets reconvene  president minehan has a two
hander
ms minehan  a quick comment was just brought to mind because of tims
comments  i regularly meet with a group of investment people before fomc meetings
compared with the past several monthsparticularly during the time of the last meeting when
we were just coming off some financial market upset especially in the equity marketsthey
were saying that they felt that financial markets were frothier right now than they had been over
the past three or four years there was more money out there chasing more deals and a level of
froth that to them seemed unsustainable  i dont know what implications that has for current
policysettingim not wise enough to know that  but i do see it as tim indicated that he did as
a risk that lies over the whole environment  even though we have slower growth and somewhat
higher inflation this overall forecast is so benign and despite what the yield curve and the fed
funds futures tell us the market seems to be buying into the whole benign outlook and thinking
that its going to continue forever  clearly it wont  what the spillover effects will be and what
we can do about them now or in succeeding meetings are questions to which i dont have an
answer but i do think they are questions and i would like to reiterate what tim had to say
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  my outlook like most of the rest of yours was
basically the same as the one in the greenbook and it hasnt changed all that much over the past
few weeks  like the rest of you i see income growing at less than the growth rate of potential
for several quarters the pace held down by housing and the slower growth of consumption that
has become evident in recent data and confirmed by president pooles reports  this is offset
over time by a strengthening of business spending the end to the inventory correction that we
see in ip and ism statements and a pickup in capital expenditures as businesses feel more
comfortable that the expansion will continue and that any overbuilding they did when income
growth was higher in those three or four years that president stern was talking about has been
absorbed  like the rest of you i see a pickup in demand to something like the growth rate of
potential some time next year as housing activity adjusts to the lower level of demand and as
inventory is worked off  several favorable factors support this eventual return to potential
supportive financial conditions especially for businesses credit availability which weve just
been talking about narrow credit spreads low longterm rates and good foreign demand
another upward adjustment in this greenbook to restoftheworld economic growth and the
decline in the dollarwhich will support exports  i used the staff structural growth of 2
percent  it seemed to me that the adjustments the staff made were small offsetting in
participation and productivity and looked reasonable given the recent data  there is still a
tension between the labor data and having potential growth as high as it is and it leaves the staff
in a position in which labor force participation is slightly above the trend which strikes me as
where it ought to be when the unemployment rate is slightly below the nairu  also
productivity is slightly below the trend so they need fasterthantrend productivity growth just to
get back to their now lower trend which strikes me as where it ought to be after three or four
quarters of belowtrend growth and presumably some labor hoarding but not that much below
trend  so that looked like a reasonable assumption to me and thats what i used in my
projection
i differ from the greenbook in a couple of respects  one is that i had softer equity and
house prices than the staff did  on the equity fronti think i said this last timei expected
equity prices to be soft and theyre up 6 percent  laughter  fortunately i dont back my
predictions with my personal wealth  butim going to hold to that predictionlaughter the
market still seems to be building in a more rapid increase in profits than seems consistent with
moderate nominal gdp growth and some rebalancing of the laborcapital share which we may
be beginning to see  certainly there is practically no growth at all in domestic profits in the
greenbook for 08  now the market may get more from the foreign profits as people have been
saying but i think there is potential for disappointment there  on house prices inventories are
large and the pricetorent ratio is still extremely high  on the demand side i think demand is
being damped by tightening in subprime and alta markets  on the supply side there will be
some more foreclosures particularly as rates adjust up this year  so i presume that prices will
need to drop somewhat rather than just stay level as in the staff forecast even to get the housing
stabilization and eventual slight rebound that the staff and i included in our real gdp forecast
now to offset the effects of weakness in wealth from these prices i had a slight easing of
monetary policy this year next year and the following year percentage point each yearto
get that same output  this was only a slight easing in real rates given that inflation is edging
down and inflation expectations arent presumed to change very much  i did this in the context
of what i would have as an interim inflation target of 2 percent  i think 2 percent is achievable
without significant output loss  it is low by historical standards and broadly consistent with price
stability and minimal welfare distortions relative to 1 percent  i agree that a little lower might
be nice eventually but i would get there opportunistically by leaning against any increases and
accepting decreases rather than deliberately going to 1 percent  im skeptical about the
expectations effect that might accrue from the announcement of a 1 percent commitment
a second difference with the greenbook is that i assumed a slightly lower nairu
4 percent  any point estimate is sillywe really have only the vaguest ideabut it seemed to
me that the compensation data the price data of the past few years were more consistent with a
nairu that was a bit below 5and so i assumed 4 percent  as a consequence i had slightly
less inflation than the staff forecast01 in 07 and in 08  so i had 22 in 07 and 20 in 08 and
had it staying there in 09  in some sense i thought the more interesting part of the forecast was
thinking about the second momentsthe skews and the probabilities around the central
tendencies  i confess that for 07 i committed the sin of thinking things were more uncertain
than usual mr chairman  laughter  i hate it when i hear people say that
chairman bernanke  theyre always more uncertain than usual  laughter
mr kohn  so here is my reasoning  i thought that the average includes lots of
episodes of more or less steady growth in steady state and then other episodes of cyclical
adjustments  in my mind we were in the middle of a kind of minicycle which was an
adjustment from greaterthansustainable growth to growth that we hope is sustainable  weve
seen that the adjustment had already created some inventory overhangs and some changes in
capital spending plans  so i thought that because were not at a steady state things might be a
little more uncertain than usual  but i compensated for that by narrowing my confidence bands
in 08 and 09 laughter when i think well be close to a kind of a steady state
on the skews part like president geithner i had downside skews on output  it wasnt so
much housing because i think that with the adjustment to demand or activity thats in the staff
forecast and my own adjustment to prices the risks around that are approximately balanced  nor
was it a spreading of problems in the subprime market to other credit markets i think weve seen
enough since the subprime problems started to be pretty sure that the risk is no more than the
normal kind  rather the risk i saw was from concerns about the financial position and the
psychology of the household sector and the interaction of those with housing  so it was a
spillover in some sense from housing to consumption  the financial obligations ratio is very
high  households as president geithner noted are highly leveraged  one of the surprises to me
in the development of subprime markets was apparently how many borrowers and lenders were
counting on the future appreciation in houses just to support the debt service to say nothing of
the consumption that must be going on at the same time  i suspect that this is more widespread
than just the subprime market  how many households were expecting price appreciation to
continue more as it did before rather than to slow down or even for prices to decline as i think
they will its hard to say  but i suspect there are a lot of these households and i think we could
get some feedback there  the staff has the saving rate actually declining in the second and third
quarters and there might be some technical reasons for that  even to get modest consumption
growth we see a very gradual uptrend in the saving rate over time  that might be the most
likely outcome but it did suggest to me that there is at least some fatter tail on the possibility that
households seeing whats happening in the housing market and to their financial obligations
will draw back more quickly from spending
when president geithner and i were in basel the most popular question to us was
whether capital spending would really pick up again  a number of central bankers doubted that
that could happen as long as consumption wasnt growing more rapidly  but im comfortable
with the capital spending pattern so long as the consumption pattern looks something like the
pattern in the greenbook and like the one that i have as my most likely outcome
more generally as you pointed out at one point last fall mr chairman i think were in a
very unusual situation of belowpotential growth for an extended perioda situation that is
pretty much unprecedented without breaking out one way or another  some nonlinearity is going
to come up and bite us here and as i see it the nonlinearity is most likely in the household
sector
now if income proceeds along the expected path it seems to me that there are upside
risks to inflation moving down to 2 percent and staying there in our forecast  i think that overall
were facing a more difficult inflation environment than we have for the past ten years or so  the
high level of resource utilization rising import prices from the decline in the dollar and the high
level of demand relative to potential supply globally including in the emergingmarket
economiesone thing we heard in basel was that increasing numbers of these economies are
having trouble sterilizing their reserve accumulation and are running into inflation pressures
from that happeninghigher prices for energy food and other commodities higher headline
inflation and possibly even slower trend productivity growth  i didnt see a downside skew to
any of these things  but as i thought about the whole picture with all these things seeming to tilt
a bit on one side and their interaction it seemed to me that there was some upside risk to the
possibility that inflation expectations would rise rather than stay where they are as assumed in
my most likely outcome  now for policy purposes i would weight the upside risk to inflation
more than the downside risk to growth but well get to that later in the day  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  my own views on the economy havent
changed much since we last met and arent terribly at odds with the greenbook  id highlight a
couple of reasons for concern a couple of areas in which the misses could be severe  i share the
views expressed by many around the table most recently by governor kohn on the inflation
front  i remain quite concerned about inflation prospects and im keeping a wary eye on
inflation expectations particularly if there were to be acceleration in the trends on commodity
prices or the foreign exchange value of the dollar  my sense is that the markets havent fully
taken into account what that could be and we could find the markets more preoccupied with an
inflation scare than they appear to be at this moment  so i think that during the balance of 07
the inflation risks tend to be more significant than the growth risks and i would expect to see
sequential increases in gdp as in the greenbook as we go through the next several quarters
the big point of what that is predicated on is really the continued accommodation in the credit
markets and the capital markets as several people have noted
i was thinking about my projections and as we look to 08 and 09 the bigger risks there
tend to be more policy oriented as we head into the next election and they may well have some
effect on the capital markets  so as i think about the second half of 08 and the first half of 09
and what the likely gdp implications would be i cant help but think that changes or perceived
changes in tax policy and trade policy could be the biggest drivers to the capital markets and as
a result have the biggest effects on the macroeconomy  so there are huge risks as i look beyond
07 in terms of where gdp might come out but as a central case the greenbook formulation
looks roughly in accord with my own
let me spend a moment on consumption  my view is broadly consistent with what others
have said earlier today  i spoke in the past week with one credit card company whose customer
base is similar to the average aggregate customer base in the united states  they have about
onefifth of all credit card spending and they reported to me their april results which might
provide us with some clues about pce growth and credit quality  card spending for april from
their perspective was consistent with moderate deceleration in real consumption  they ended up
in april with nominal yearoveryear growth of about 4 percent in nonauto retail sales which is
a slowdown from the fourth quarter of 06 and a slowdown from january but it is up a bit from
february and march when they were getting quite despondent and were worrying a bit about
their projections for the next three quarters  they think their april numbers look okay quite
consistent with the moderate deceleration that many folks here have talked about  they believe
that they have hit the floor on that but time will tell  what they have not been able to do at least
up to the time of my discussions with them is to break out retail purchases outside fuel to find
out whether less strength is there than the 4 percent topline number would suggest  i suspect
that would be the case  how all this fits into market expectations well know over the next
couple of days  this strikes me as an average okay number that may be a touch better than
market expectations but it shouldnt give us a whole lot of comfort if were trying to suggest that
there is a robust recovery on consumption and pce  credit quality remains very strong across
consumer credit and the companys mortgage products  i would note that they dont have much
subprime in their portfoliowhat is subprime has fallen to that level rather than having begun
there when they issued the credit  payment rates use of credit lines delinquencies charge
offsall are at very positive levels with little indication of moreserious weakening of consumer
demand  so again i think the prospects outlined by the greenbook in terms of pce look
broadly consistent with the april numbers
let me turn now to the capital markets and the credit markets and speak about three or
four observations that may be a bit more newsworthy than when we last met six weeks ago
first i will talk a little about the dearth of defaults in corporate loans then spend a couple of
moments on private equity building on bill dudleys discussion at the outset on the correlation
among asset classes and finally spend a moment on the shakeout in the mortgage markets  the
predicate for this is something that we all know and several people have spoken about earlier
today  as corporate america has become more cautious wall street has become more
aggressive to satisfy investors appetites for risk  so were seeing risk aversion in one category
on main street and real riskseeking behavior on wall street  financial risktaking remains high
and may well have even increased since we last met  if youll look at the move options index
measuring onemonth volatility on treasuries its the lowest it has been in about nine years
since the index came into being and it suggests president minehans point that all the forces of
liquidity and froth that might be in the market are probably more present today than any of us
could have imagined given the tumult in the markets in late february  at the same time
nonfinancial corporate risktaking continues to be more subdued than objective measures would
suggest it should be  there is reason to hope that the capex data will come around to where
many of us expected it to be already but some determination still needs to be done on that  so
we hear and some of us even say that these capital markets appear priced to perfection that
credit markets are as strong as ever and that liquidity is plentiful  i would add my concern to the
implausibility of that notion which president geithner and others spoke about  the reason for
central bankers to worry is of course that these narrower spreads provide less of a shock
absorber for unforeseen events
let me now go through the points that i mentioned at the outset and describe their
implications for the decisions we make  first is the dearth of defaults on corporate loans
historically low yearahead default rates were referenced in the greenbook and they should give
us comfort at least in theory  i share the greenbook view that corporate defaults should increase
as profits level out and leverage increases to more normal levels  but fewer defaults are even
possible in this financing environment and that makes me a little less sanguine about those data
if we think about covenant packages on corporate loans both originated on wall street and
originated at community banksi think president yellen spoke at a previous meeting about
covenantlite dealsit is incredibly hard to get defaults in the context of these loans never mind
eventofdefault notices and everything else that would find its way into the indentures  as a
result we have seen a recent spate of financings with covenant packages that are increasingly
issuerfriendly without triggers that would otherwise cause defaults  no debt payment
schedules never mind even the need to make interest payments with the ability to turn those into
sort of payinkind notes  all of that it strikes me should make us nervous if business
fundamentals shift abruptly and investors are left with little opportunity to gain access to their
capital or to be in a position to force companies to restructure their operations  as a result i am
less sanguine about these low default data that we continue to receive from wall street
a second point is the state of private equity in the capital markets  what i note builds on
the recent history that weve seen  massive fundraisings larger lbos increasing leverage in
the past twelve months weve seen the socalled club deal phenomenon the growth of equity
bridges which i and others have talked about and when we last met we discussed the interest
many of these firms have for rushing into the capital markets by finding permanent capital  the
newest development is the growth of syndication in the equity placement in these lbo markets
the same way that we have syndicated debt markets that have matured incredibly over the past
six to ten years on the equity side there are huge investments that are presently being considered
and potentially being made  so one lbo sponsor might fund a certain portion of the equity
check on an lbo and then line up through an equity syndicate manager at a traditional
investment bank or a commercial bank the ability to sell down the rest of that equity through an
infrastructure and distribution system that is being built  i doubt that we will see that syndication
market five years from now as deep and as large as the debt markets  but i do think that it shows
us that new liquidity continues to come even to the private placement 144a markets alongside
the growth in the public capital markets  that liquidity could well improve tradability  to the
extent that these syndications are new they show us that liquidity is plentiful but they also show
us that many of these new mechanisms have not been stresstested  the other implication of this
boom in private equity is that it has raised the floor on equity prices  my sense is that there is a
private equity put that may well have replaced what used to be thought of as a federal reserve
put on the floor of equity prices and that equity put appears to be larger than it has ever been
thus we have seen increased total leverage through these structured products credit markets as
ive mentioned are more robust and there is a question of stress testing which is still to be
determined
another point on the capital markets relates to what bill said about the correlation among
asset classes  ceos cfos and chief risk officers of large financial firms have found quite
troubling the greater correlation among asset classes than most of their internal models had
suggested  as they looked at their dashboards in the weeks after the tumult that we saw last
february they grew increasingly uncomfortable about whether they had accurately measured
what their firms downside risks are  certainly its encouraging as bill showed us that there
appears to be less correlation over recent weeks  thats a lesson being learned and relearned and
tested and retested in these institutions  that they may be heeding the wakeup call is good news
but time will tell whether it will be enough to catch up before problems arise in the market
my final point concerns the consequences of a shakeout in the mortgage markets  my
sense is that after the fallout in subprime the market is becoming more consolidated with larger
moresophisticated lenders that can more quickly provide more markets that satisfy customers
newest wants  the success in these markets of investment banks and hedge funds will go to
those with scale with strong distribution systems and with control over their servicing
businesses so that they are effectively able to engineer workouts and avoid the need to foreclose
i think that over the balance of this year we will hear more news from small and mediumsized
commercial banks that feel as though their market share is being taken away during this tumult
and that is something that we need to continue to observe  with that mr chairman ill save the
rest of my comments for the next round
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  the last time we met one theme was the greater
uncertainty and governor kohn mentioned that he is feeling greater uncertainty now than he ever
had  i am not sure that greater uncertainty has been the tenor of the comments here today but i
think it has been greater uncertainty with downside risk  so the key issue from last time that i think
is still with us is that we certainly saw evidence of the slowdown and as president stern mentioned
that sometimes we have to acknowledge reality and we did have much slower growth than many
people had been expecting in the two previous meetings  the greenbook suggests that the
slowdown is unlikely to persistand i broadly agree with that view as do many people around the
tablebut i want to review five key uncertainties that we talked about last time and to discuss how
they developed and where they are likely to go
the first uncertainty is investment and of course a lot of us have spoken about that  i
would rate the level of uncertainty as still elevated there  i am not going to use color coding to rate
that uncertainty but i would say it is still elevated  we have recently gotten some moresolid
numbers but those are just recent and i think it is still more a glimmer of hope than something we
can bank on that we are going to get a turnaround in investment  that we have seen some better
numbers in ism durable goods and so forth says that the direction is perhaps a little more positive
than we were thinking six weeks ago  but there is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty about
whether the pickup in business investment will help offset any slowdown in consumption to make
sure that we continue to grow in the 2 percent range going forward
the second uncertainty is productivity and potential output  obviously that is still at an
elevated level  as far as i am concerned it is one of the biggest challenges for us to think about in
the intermediate run  in particular a downside scenario that concerns me is that if we do not have a
pickup in investment we are unlikely to see a sustained rise in productivity growth  if perhaps one
reason for the lower investment is that there are concerns about productivity growth or returns from
that investment we could have a fairly negative scenario in which we get much lower potential
output  offsetting that concern is that we are seeing some glimmers of hope on investment  with
respect to potential i think it is appropriate that the greenbook has raised participation rates a bit
given that older people seem to be healthier than previous cohorts were and seem to be more willing
to work  however i think the big question mark is exactly as david said that not until august will
we get a better feel for which way the data revision will go because the difference between the two
sides of the balance sheet is fairly big  broadly i share gary sterns optimism that it is not a good
bet to bet against the us economy and against ultimately good productivity growth  but i have the
concern that i do not fully understand the slowness of the investment recovery and some of the
productivity slowdown  there is potentially a worrying downside scenario there
third is the uncertainty about the housing market and subprime  well obviously
uncertainty on subprime was highly elevated then and it has come down quite a bit  we have seen
some tightening of lending standards particularly at the lower end  the survey of senior loan
officers asked for a differentiation between subprime and prime lending standards  it showed a very
dramatic increase in subprime standards which is exactly what we would expect in this kind of
market certainly potentially reducing demand at least in the lower end of the housing market
about the housing market in and of itself the uncertainty is still there  we still have a lot of
uncertainty about whether the numbers are telling us about weather or about the actual strength of
the market  as i think i have mentioned to a number of you before we need to have besides dave
a meteorologist on the staff to forecast the weather because every number we hear on the housing
market is not a number in which we can put any stock it all has to do with heat or cold or rain or
snow or whatever other thing that mother nature may throw at us  so i still think there is a pretty
mixed picture there  as i said we have seen very little evidence of spillovers from the subprime
market  the main concern and this is a variation of what governor warsh said is that something
we or the congress might do might cut off this market  we have to be mindful of any actions that
we may be taking with respect to guidance as well as of any actions that the congress may be
taking that could reduce this market more than otherwise
the yield curve is favorable for a lot of the variablerate subprime borrowers to move into
fixedrate products with payment shock of perhaps no more than 50 basis points  the
delinquencies we have been seeing have not been due to resets or to payment shock  they have
been due primarily to the socalled juvenile delinquentsthe early defaulters going bad  that
means that we do not know what is coming down the line because we have not really seen the
experience of the resets  now with the recently benign yield curve that situation could reasonably
be worked out  the key is whether any equity is left  if no equity is left and the resets come these
guys are likely to walk  if they have been doing risk layeringputting really no money downand
the prices go down that will be a problem  so i think that may be a bit of a slow burn  coupled
with the broader misalignment that we are seeing now of a little increase in housing starts which in
some ways we would see as a positive is a sort of negative given that housing sales seem to be
declining so much  thus there seems to be a disconnect between supply and demand and i think
the greenbook is now quite wisely saying that we will likely have a longer transition in the housing
market
a fourth area of uncertainty that we talked about last time was the financial marketsthe
dramatic spike up in volatility  that volatility spike has come down but we being good
economists can never be satisfied with either high volatility or low volatility  low volatility is of
concern to us and i very much share the concerns that tim cathy kevin and others have
mentioned  not only in the united states but also in the rest of the world are some of those
spreads a bit narrower than they otherwise would be  in particular there are concerns about banks
chasing private equity deals going covenantfree  in many of my discussions with private equity
folks instead of saying well bring us on more capital those contacts are the ones saying that the
banks are pushing them to take greater leverage than they otherwise would want  now if that isnt
the fox guarding the henhouse i do not know what is  you want the banks to be the disciplinary
force and that they would potentially be taking on very large risks is a real concern
the fifth area of uncertainty was consumption  we have seen a bit of a stepdown in
consumption growth but there is still a lot of uncertainty and i share the exact concerns that
governor kohn articulated given that there are likely to be some wealth effects even though we
have some offsetting effects in the stock market i do not want to bet on those offsetting effects in
the stock market being there for the next three quarters  housing wealth seems to be flattening if
not coming down with the caseshiller index on average for those ten markets down 3 to 5 percent
if peoples thinking about their consumption pattern is based on some increase in housing wealth
the saving rate should at least gradually increase  at some point that reality may be biting and
leading to some concern
on the inflation front once again we will have continuing uncertainty about what drives
shortterm to intermediateterm inflation  as i mentioned last time we get very very mild effects
from the traditional things that we think that make a difference  oil energy commodity prices and
resource utilization dont seem to have that much force but in both the short and intermediate terms
i think they are leaning on the positive side rather than on the negative side  we still have the
owners equivalent rent issue that is coming in with the transition in the housing market and is still
to some extent temporarily pushing up our measured inflation rates  inflation expectations continue
to seem to be quite well contained and that i think is key because given that these other forces do
not seem to be important in the short to intermediate run inflation expectations are very important
so my bottom line is that although i see some downside risks on growth i think the greenbook
scenario is a reasonable central tendency one and i see some important upside risks on inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i would characterize where we are compared
with the last meeting as that we have gone through a soft patch which was more extensive than we
expected  but the basic longerterm outlook is really the same as the one that we had the last time
around  that is what is really relevant to our policy decisions because our policy decisions now do
not affect the economy until a year or two down the road
looking at the issue of the risks i was most worried at the last meeting about what was
happening in business fixed investment particularly because i did not really understand what was
going on and it is always the case that when you have knightian uncertainty you get much more
nervous  the numbers have come in a bit better on those grounds so i am a little less worried about
business fixed investment  but then we have had a downshift in housing which again was
unexpected  so when i put those things together i think that we are in a situation of a fair amount
of uncertainty  maybe i am a little less worried about the uncertainty and the downside risk
although i think they are still there only because in the housing case from the point of view of the
longerrun fundamentals i do not see a big problem  it really is an inventorycorrection issue
which we are trying to sort out  that is creating uncertainty but it creates more uncertainty in the
shorter term rather than in the longer term  even though there is still uncertainty with the issue of
business fixed investment it may be a little bit less  so perhaps there is a slight skew on the
downside in terms of my confidence intervals but a little less than last time if that gives me any
comfort
about the inflation issue i am more optimistic than the greenbook  i see inflation coming
down to 21 percent by the end of 2007 and then to 2 percent and staying there thereafter  my
reasoning here i think is familiar to you  i consider longrun inflation expectations to be a key
driver of the inflation process  i see those numbers as around 2 percent and unless we make a
concerted effort to change inflation expectations i think that is where they will stay  also i am
confident that we will do the right thing to make sure that inflation expectations do not go up from
there and i think the markets have similar confidence in that regard
when i look at the risks in terms of inflation of most concern to me is the issue of what has
happened to structural productivity  we have numbers coming in that we really cannot fully
explain  maybe there is just something a bit wrong with okuns law and productivity will revert
back to it and then were okay  but maybe there is actually something more that we have had such
tight labor markets when in fact the economy has been growing at quite a slow pace  there is a
real question about what this may mean  if structural productivity is actually downshifting more
than we expect that does create a serious inflation risk that we have to be very concerned about  on
the other side is the issue about whether we really are in tight labor markets  you look at the
numbers in terms of compensation and so forth and they dont look too bad  this might tell us is
that the nairu may be somewhat loweragain if we even know exactly what the nairu
concept meanswhich is the issue of knightian uncertainty not normal uncertainty  so in this
context the basic forecast outline that we have is actually a fairly benign one  i am willing to bet
that it is probably the most reasonable forecast to have  i am pretty comfortable with it  but we will
have to wait to see what kind of data come in  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  let me try to summarize the discussion around
the table and take any comments on the summary and then i would like to add just a few thoughts
broadly speaking the outlook of most participants has not substantially changed since march
housing remains weak and it is the greatest source of downside risk  whether the demand for
housing has stabilized remains difficult to judge in part because of subprime issues  it is also
unclear whether builders will seek to return inventories to historical levels and if so at what rate
there is yet no indication of significant spillover from housing to other sectors although that
remains a risk  the downside risks to investment have moderated since the last meeting although
investment seems unlikely to be a strong driver of growth  the inventory cycle is now well
advanced and production is strengthening  consumption growth seems likely to moderate
reflecting factors such as weakness in house prices and high energy prices  however the labor
market remains strong particularly in the market for highly skilled workers  incomes generated by
the labor market together with gains in the stock market and generally accommodative financial
conditions should provide some support for consumption going forward  financial markets are
priced for perfection which implies some risks on that score  foreign economies remain strong and
should be a source of support although some are undertaking monetary tightening  overall the
economy is in a soft patch and will likely grow below trend for a while  growth should return to
potential later this year or in 2008 depending on the evolution of the housing market  the rate of
potential growth remains hard to pin down  several participants seem a bit more optimistic than the
greenbook on potential growth and the nairu although there are risks
inflation has improved a bit and most see continued but very slow moderation  however
there are upside risks to inflation including compensation the dollar energy prices and a slowing
in productivity  moreover a rise in inflation from current levels would be costly particularly if it
involved unhinging inflation expectations  vigilance on inflation must therefore be maintained
overall the risks and uncertainties seem a bit less pronounced than at the last meeting and
participants seemed relatively comfortable with the outlook  although there are some potentially
significant downside risks to output arising particularly from the housing sector and the possible
spillover to consumption the group still appears to view a failure of inflation to moderate as
expected to be the predominant risk to longerterm stability  are there any comments or questions
hearing none i will just add a few points  first following president yellen i think that the
tension between slow growth and a strong labor market remains central to understanding whats
going on  okuns law is supposed to work better than this  laughter  i looked at recent history
over the past twenty years or so there has been no exact parallel to what we are seeing now  there
was a jobless recovery in 9193 in which unemployment remained high even though growth was
picking up and we had a midcycle slowdown in 95 and 96 which was relatively short and not
very severe in which the unemployment rate got temporarily ahead of growth  so there have been
some deviations  interestingly after the 2001 recession despite lots of talk about jobless recoveries
okuns law worked pretty well  so we are in an unusual situationinstead of a jobless recovery
we have growthless job growth  laughter
interpreting this correctly is very important  the staff forecast essentially assumes that
okuns law will revert to historical tendency  i think that assumption is reasonable particularly
since the staff is not exceptionally optimistic about potential growth and therefore that particular
source of error is moderated  that would suggest that labor hoarding is probably a good part of
what is happening here  if there is one area in which labor hoarding appears to be significant it
would be construction as president yellen mentioned  i asked the staff to do a simple study of this
relationship to which dave stockton referred  andrew figura and adam looney of the boards
staff performed a regression analysis in which they regressed all construction employment against
all investment in structures quarterly with lags going back to 1985  the reason to look at all
construction in terms of both employment and production is that there is a lot of substitutability
between those two categories  that regression approach should also account for unmeasured labor
including undocumented workers and the like  in this analysis they found that employment is
roughly proportional to construction activity but with substantial lags which again is somewhat
surprising  indeed the model fits well through the fourth quarter of 06 but then begins to
underpredict significantly in the first quarter of 07  if this model is correct then given what is
already in the pipeline in terms of reduced construction activity and then going on with the forecast
in the greenbook we should begin to see fairly significant declines in construction employment on
the order of 30000 per month over the next year which would be sufficient in itself with all else
being equal to add 02 to 03 to the unemployment rate  so if labor hoarding explains the failure of
okuns law then we may soon see some gradual rise in the unemployment rate which would also
be consistent with the view that the staff has taken that a good bit of the slowdown in productivity is
cyclical
it is actually fairly difficult to calculate the contribution of the construction sector to
productivity because it involves not just construction workers but also upstream production of
various kinds  but one estimate which comes from discussions with the council of economic
advisers had the implication of employment hoarding in construction being about  percentage
point on productivity growth  we will see how that develops  even though i believe as does the
staff that we will see some softening in the labor market i should say that the evidence is still quite
tentative  we saw a bit of weakness in the last labor report but unemployment insurance claims
remain low and we do not really see a significant indication
the other major issue is the housing market  again as a number of people pointed out this
is an inventorycycle problem  the two main determinants of an inventory cycle are 1 what the
level of final demand is and 2 how quickly you move to bring inventories back to normal  there
does seem to have been some stepdown in final demand over the past few months  assuming that
homebuilders would like to get not all the way to but significantly toward their last ten years
inventories by the end of 2008 implies fairly weak construction not only in the second quarter but
going into the third quarter as well  only in the fourth quarter will we see a relatively minor
subtraction from gdp  thats also relatively speculative but residential construction does seem
fairly likely to me to be more of a drag than we previously thought and to continue to be a problem
into the third quarter
there will also be a slowdown in consumption  we have been having rates near 4 percent
which is certainly not sustainable  we already see indications that consumption may be closer to 2
percent in the second quarter  i think the houseprice effects are going to show up  gasoline prices
will have an effect  the labor market is strong but it is going to slow a bit  so it looks to me as
though underlying growth is roughly 2 percent and will be so for a couple of quarters to come
notice in the thinking about the underlying case that there has been quite an asynchronicity between
private domestic final demand and production lately  for example for the second quarter we expect
to see weaker private domestic final demand but probably a stronger gdp number because of
rebounds in net exports and the like  but we should look past thatthose are just quartertoquarter
variationsand observe that growth is moderate an observation that is supported by the sense that
industrial production and manufacturing seem to be picking up  to summarize i think that the
notion of moderate growth with some uncertainty and with return toward potential later in the year
or early next year is still probably about the right forecast
on inflation theres the famous stock market prediction that prices will fluctuate  that
seems to be true also for inflation  i mentioned at the last meeting that the monthly standard
deviation in inflation numbers is about 008 and so between 01 and 03 there is not necessarily a
whole lot of information  we have a few pieces of good news  i think vacancy rates are rising for
both apartments and singlefamily homes  at some point we will begin to see better progress on
owners equivalent rent and shelter costs  also the quarterly average of medical cost increases was
much more moderate than in the first two months which suggests that maybe this risk is not as
serious as it may have looked  however as many people pointed out there are a number of
negatives including the dollar energy food prices commodity prices and most importantly the
labor market  the compensation data remain quite mixedin particular the eci which was a very
soft headline number  the 11 percent quarterly wage and salary number or 36 percent for twelve
months is now more or less consistent with what were seeing in average hourly earnings  if
productivity falls below 2 percent then we are beginning to get to a range in which unit labor costs
will be putting pressure on inflation  so i am quite comfortable with the view expressed around the
table that although inflation looks to be stabilizing and perhaps falling slowly there are significant
risks to inflation and we should take those very seriously
very much a side pointi did have some interesting discussions with the staff about the
role of the stock market in the forecast  this is not the staffs fault but there is a sort of tension in
how the stock market is treated  on the one hand the stock market is assumed to grow at 6
percent from the current level  on the other hand the forecast has profit growth going essentially to
zero by the third quarter but interest rates coming up  those two things are a little hard to reconcile
the difficult problem is which way you should go to reconcile it  on the one hand it could be that
the forecast is right and therefore the stock market will in fact be weaker that will have
implications for stability for consumption and so on  on the other hand perhaps we should be
taking information from the stock market in making our forecast  so it is a very difficult problem
and i just wanted to point out the tension that we will have to see resolved over the next few
quarters  one partial resolution is that as has been noted the stock market and the economy as a
whole can be decoupled to some extent because of overseas profits  this is an interesting example
of how financial globalization is creating stability for domestic consumptionyou know
decoupling domestic consumption from domestic production  again we had a very good
discussion with the staff about this issue and i think it is just something we will need to think about
going forward
in summary in the last meeting we felt that uncertainty had risen  there has been perhaps a
slight moderation of those concerns at this pointa little less inflation risk a little less growth risk
nevertheless the balance of risks with inflation being the greater still seems to me to be a
reasonable approach  let me now turn to vincent to begin the policy goround
mr reinhart3  thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the materials that were passed around during the coffee break  for the past few years the committee has taken a belt and suspenders approach to providing guidance to financial markets by characterizing both the likely direction of interest rates and the risks to its dual objectives  in march you loosened the belt a few notches by replacing the reference to additional firming with morebalanced language but retained the macroeconomic assessment that inflation risks were the more serious concern  the top left panel of your first exhibit provides one way to score the immediate market consequences of that change  the black and red bars respectively plot the changes in two and ten year treasury yields in the oneandaquarterhour window bracketing the 215 pm release of statements for the past two years  as some of you predicted market participants saw particular significance in the march announcement that the committee was apparently no longer presuming that its next action would be a firming and two and tenyear yields fell 10 and 5 basis points respectively the biggest moves in the sample shown
after a bit of confusion about what the statement really meant markets ultimately got the message aided in part by chairman bernankes testimony your speeches and the minutes  i take from this the sense that the wording of the statement is important laughter but that there are also other opportunities to provide a morenuanced policy message  the message that market participants got both from you and from the incoming data on net over the intermeeting period is seen in the top right panel by the shift from the dotted red to the solid black line depicting the path of the

3  material used by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 3
expected federal funds rate  futures quotes now imply a consensus that policy will be kept on hold today and at the june meeting but then will be eased  percentage point by the end of next year  this modest upward repricing of money market futures yields accompanied a reemergence of remarkably benign financial conditions the subject of the three middle panels  corporate bond spreads at the left and implied volatilities on equities and money market futures in the middle retraced much of the runup of late february to end the period at relatively low levels by historical standards  equity prices at the right gained 7 percent to reach new highs  as youll see a little later this addition to household wealth pushed up estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate and may importantly influence your thinking about nearterm economic prospects
in the bottom left panel i trot out the usual suspects for why stock prices rose firstquarter earnings reports were solid so higher share value may just be a bet on rising domestic and foreign profitsthe latter seeming especially more secure in light of the apparent vigor of the global economy  our estimates of the equity premium one of which is shown at the bottom right as the spread between the forward
earningsprice ratio and the longterm real interest ratenarrowed a bit suggesting that investors were more accepting of risk  also investors may see less risk as in answer c  potentially bad things that seemed palpable as the subprime market melted down did not go bump in the nightthat is downside risks to the outlook appeared to ease  what is the right answer to this multiple choice test  i think d all of the above in that the worlds growth prospects seem a little more assured and as a result investors see fewer risks and are more willing to take them on
that backdrop leads naturally to a discussion of policy choices which begins by examining the case for alternative b which is in your next exhibit  the last time that you sat at this table to consider the setting of policy you chose to keep the federal funds rate at 5 percent  the way the staff has filtered the flow of information since march has produced only minor changes to their outlook for real gdp growth the top left panel and core pce inflation the top right panel  so if you were content in march would you not be so in may  keeping the nominal funds rate at 5 percent is consistent as plotted in the middle panel with the real federal funds rate the solid black line rising to continue to match the greenbookconsistent measure of its equilibrium value the dotted green line  if you believe that framework this stance of policy should return the level of output to its potential within three years  some of you might argue that such an outcome is not good enough  with core pce inflation lingering above 2 percent a more forceful working down of inflationperhaps even at the cost of creating some slackmay be required for acceptable economic performance  while that may be a relevant consideration riskmanagement issues may tug in the opposite direction  in particular and as shown by the solid line in the bottom panel the staff forecast puts real gdp growth in the neighborhood of 2 percent for the next six quarters  times in which economic growth has been at or has dipped below 2 percentthe dashed horizontal linehave often been followed by recessionthe shaded regions  concern that the economy would be flying close to stall speed may stay your hand from dealing more aggressively with inflation
indeed concerns about growth may incline you to believe that your next policy action will be an easingthe subject of the left column of charts in exhibit 3  as has been true for some time the case for alternative a rests importantly on your assessment of the housing market  newhome sales the solid black line in the middle panel have taken another step down further elevating the months supply of unsold new homes the dotted red line  this inventory correction will impose a drag on residential investment for some timeand could get worse if the availability of funds tightens some more in light of the woes in the subprime mortgage market  you also might now harbor doubts that businesses will step up their spending which would otherwise have cushioned any slowing in the growth of aggregate demand  while the latest readings on orders and on shipments of capital goods plotted as the solid black and dotted red lines respectively in the bottom left panel were encouraging you might dismiss those as one months noisy signal around a downwardpointing trend in addition you might see financial markets as ripe to correct once investors come to appreciate that earnings prospects are as tepid as in the greenbook forecast
but risks to economic growth are not the committees sole concerns  in march you identified the failure of inflation to moderate from its current elevated level to be the predominant concern  the case for alternative c presented in the right panels probably hinges on the view that inflation is not clearly on a downward trend seen in the middle panel by inflation as measured by the core pce price index the solid black line and the marketbased core pce index the dotted red line  in addition the outlook for inflation may now be seen as less favorable than in march given the runup in the prices of oil and other commodities  as shown in the bottom right panel futuresmarket participants have revised up their forecasts for the prices of these items well into the future  if the pace of moderation of core inflation turns out to be even slower than previously anticipated you might be concerned that longrun inflation expectations will drift up making for difficult policy choices going forward the prevailing expectations of inaction shaped in part by official comments may take alternatives a and c off the table for today  but any inclination to favor the arguments in either the right or the left columns should influence your choice of language in the statement the subject of your last exhibit  this exhibit is just table 1 repeated from the bluebook with no emendation
i note that in the discussion of communications the committee thus far has been reluctant to specify an inflation goal consistent with its dual mandate  however by describing current inflation as somewhat elevated as was the case in march you are implicitly characterizing the upper limit of your tolerance for inflation just as you delimited its lower bound in the summer of 2003 with talk of unwelcome disinflation  market participants will read much into your choice of words when the time comes to change that characterization  so at some point you will have to come to terms with your preferred specification of your inflation goal either directly through deliberations on communication policy or indirectly through the wording of the statement  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for vincent  if not we can
begin the policy goround
mr poole  i guess by default i will start  first of all i favor alternative b both the
language and the unchanged federal funds target  let me make a couple of comments about market
liquidity  first liquidity is not reduced at all by deals  deals simply transfer the funds from the
buyers to the sellers who then have to figure out what to do with all that cash  deals are probably
being driven at least in part by very narrow risk spreads  but my sense is that so far these spreads
are consistent with actual losses in the markets  obviously if that situation continues then risk
spreads should remain low and we should continue to have a very active amount of deal making
some of the returns from the deals really feed into good productivity performance because part of
the purpose of these deals is to take over companies that are not performing well and to eliminate
marginally profitable or unprofitable operations and that is really good for productivity  to the
extent that the deals are simply increasing leveragesort of financial engineeringthen that does
not do anything for productivity  it does increase risk and vulnerability should the economy
perform other than anticipated  we cannot really do anything about that situation except to avoid
creating surprises ourselves it is really on the whole beyond our control  governor kohn talked
about standard errors and i must say that when it comes to standard errors i am very much an
indexer and not a market timer  laughter  it is easy to fool yourself just as in investment policy
but that is where i come out there
on the issue of the inflation targetand i am glad that we are closing in on this topici
honestly do not believe that we can credibly be satisfied with an inflation forecast for 2009 that far
out of 2 percent and at the same time continue to talk about a comfort zone of 1 to 2  that does not
seem to me to be internally consistent because we cannot control inflation to 01 percentage point
so either we have to decide that our true target is something like 1 plus or minus  as an issue for
control errors and other considerations or we need to start being explicit about a comfort zone of
1 to 2  i am worried about the latter approach because it runs the risk of raising market
expectations and of unhinging expectations  expectations have been very solidly held  if we get
into a situation in which through inevitable things that happen that we cannot control the inflation
rate were to run consistently at lets say for the sake of argument 2 instead of around 2 then
those market expectations might not be so well entrenched at 2 as a consequence of having
willingly and openly or by defaultby revealed preference if you willmoved effectively to raise
the comfort zone  i am very much a hardliner on this  i think that we ought to continue with a
comfort zone of 1 to 2 and we ought to think about the inflation target as being 1 plus or minus a
half  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pooles comments remind me that i did
have a question vincent  it is what do you think is the effect of the term on balance in the
inflation paragraph
mr reinhart  we added the term on balance in drafting the bluebook for both the
timeseries and the crosssectional perspectives  that is first from the timeseries perspective you
are not looking at just one monthly number  you may be doing as complicated an analysis as
president stern in looking at three six and twelvemonth changes  second it has a cross
sectional aspect to it  you are not just focused on the one number of core pce but youre taking in
the whole suite of price indexes
chairman bernanke  well lets just say core inflation so it wouldnt be every
inflation measure
mr reinhart  yes but you are not hanging your hat necessarily on the pce versus the
cpi  the thought is that the insertion of that language means that youre tending to smooth through
recent observations and we took it as something that would be on balancelaughter that phrase
comes very natural to us tooa little more hawkish
vice chairman geithner  sorry  which was a little more
mr reinhart  to take it out would be a little more hawkish
vice chairman geithner  it would be a more hawkish signal than a statement with
on balance
chairman bernanke  i agree with that last statement
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman  in the same vein may i just ask a
question about the likely conclusion that people would draw from the change in the second section
it has the virtue of truth  laughter  you could interpret it relative to march as a softer
characterization of the recent news  it goes in a slightly different direction from the centerof
gravity of this discussion which is to say that indicators have actually been mixed  they are
sometimes a little softer or sometimes a little stronger but we think there is maybe a slightly thinner
adverse tail in the growth outcome than we had thought in march  i am not particularly troubled by
that  but vince do you think that this would be the plausible reading by the market to the change
how would they interpret the intent of the change in section 2
mr reinhart  that it was a recognition of the incoming information  i think an
important change is also to take out the to continue to expand and leave it as just to expand
because the first quarter did not have moderate economic growth  so that part says that you are
acknowledging the most recent numbers  again the first clause is basically acknowledging that the
first part of the year not just the first quarter will potentially be kind of slow  so more than
anything it says that the committee is looking through this soft patch without using the phrase soft
patch
mr fisher  mr chairman may i ask a question
chairman bernanke  certainly
mr fisher  are you advocating that if we use the text as written in section 3 of
alternative b we would still keep the full wording from section 4 from last time
mr reinhart  the wording of section 4 would be unchanged yes
mr fisher  that may mitigate some of those concerns you have
mr reinhart  yes
chairman bernanke  since we are bringing these suggestions out early one thing
that you could do in section 2 the second sentence is simply make an assertion about moderate
growth  one could say overall however recent indicators suggest that the economy seems likely
to expand    suggesting that the news recently has been somewhat more positive  that is just a
thought  lets go to president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well earlier in talking about the economy i said
that i thought the extended outlook was reasonably favorable in terms of prospects for growth and
that i also expected a modest diminution in core inflation assuming that policy would be sustained
approximately where it is  that leads me directly to favoring alternative b as the policy choice
putting it the other way around i do not see compelling reasons to make a change at this point so i
think we should stay where we are
as far as language is concerned the bulk of the language under alternative b is fine with
me  but i do have one suggestion which is that we replace the second sentence in section 3
alternative b which talks about inflation with the second sentence in section 3 alternative c which
emphasizes uncertainty  i advocate that for several reasons but really they boil down to my
thinking that it better describes the situation in which we find ourselves  so let me just elaborate a
little  we know that the nairu is at best an imprecise concept  we know that accurate
measurement of productivity is difficult and that therefore so is estimation of potential real gdp
the output gap and so on and so forth  indeed simulations in the greenbook address those two
issues precisely and there has been a fair amount of discussion recently at this meeting about
uncertainty about the nairu and about productivity and so on   that leads me to my suggestion  i
would also observe that it is certainly not farfetched to imaginealthough this is not my forecast
that the unemployment rate or some other measure of slack may move up for a time while inflation
remains stubbornly where it is or even increases a touch  so all of that leads me to favor the
language from alternative c for that one sentence
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  president stern would you add the same words on the output side  do you
think its worth emphasizing uncertainty about inflation without also emphasizing the uncertainty
about output  although a lot of people have said it has narrowed relative to last time a lot of
people have also said that the housing situation is very uncertain
mr stern  i havent thought about that  but if you want to say that the economy seems
likely to expand we could i suppose soften that a bit to emphasize uncertainty there as well
although my sense of things is that people do in fact expect moderate growth going forward
chairman bernanke  intervention president fisher
mr fisher  no sir  i just want to comment
chairman bernanke  why dont you go ahead
mr fisher  well again i am probably the most bearish in terms of a shortterm forecast
on gdp growth and have very asymmetric confidence bands which take into account even slower
growth than that  having listened to the conversation at the table and keying off the word
hawkish that vince used i want to be owlish on growth in terms of listening to president sterns
admonition and i dont want to be a pigeon on inflationjust to kill the aviary context here
laughter  so i would advocate alternative b  i dont believe that we should change the rate  i like
very much the suggestion that president stern just made about inflation
the only thing in your summary list mr chairman that i did not hear and that i think is an
issue is the behavioral pattern of privatesector leaders who were trying to figure out how to
preserve their margins therefore i think we will have more sustained price instincts than i would
otherwise see from the current data  i think the second sentence in alternative c captures that
uncertainty and i agree with president stern  finally as always i would suggest that we add the
word global before resource utilization  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  noted  thank you
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i ask just a clarifying question on
this discussion
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  don raised the obvious question which is whether we
want to introduce the characterization of uncertainty on one piece of our outlook but not the other
but gary did you suggest that uncertainty about the inflation forecast is greater today than it was in
march
mr stern  not for me personally  but as i thought more about this and listened to some
of the conversation the uncertainty seemed to be at least as great as it was in march  in fact the
greenbook marked up core inflation a touch  that doesnt lead directly into greater uncertainty but
it is not the direction in which i would have gone if i were changing the inflation forecast
vice chairman geithner  but is your rationale mostly about greater uncertainty or
is it mostly a continued aversion to implicit reference to the output gap as being a significant force
mr stern  both
chairman bernanke  i would like to interject  we do have to think about the time
series nature of the statement and i am concerned given that our last inflation reading was very
good and reduced some of the anxiety that we were feeling in the last meeting that there will be a
lot of attempts to interpret what we meant by uncertainty  at this point are we feeling that there is
an increase in uncertainty and that we have lost confidence in this projection  i think that we have
to think very seriously not just about the sentence which is very reasonable on its face but also
about what extent the change from the last statement will be overinterpreted
mr stern  i agree with that comment 100 percent although i do think that is an issue we
are going to confront if and when we ever make that change quite honestly
mr fisher  may i make an intervention mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr fisher  if you do use that sentence then you might be able to get rid of the first
sentence in section 4 that you used previously
chairman bernanke  the core inflation sentence  which one
mr fisher  in these circumstances the committees predominant  concern   
several  no
mr fisher  i am not arguing that you include both but that you could trade one off
against the other
chairman bernanke  are there any interventions  if not president minehan
ms minehan  gosh as usual the state of play here has gotten confusedfor me
anyway  first of all the thing i am least confused about is the policy recommendation  i do not
think we should do anything at this time  i think we should stay the course at 5  i am very much
in favor of alternative b
second i want to comment about what vince said about the reaction to our statement the
last time in large part because i found that the people who talked to me about it over the past
several weeks felt that our statement communication was somehow murkier than usual if that is
possible  personally i felt that we were very clear in that statementwe saw that there was more
twosided riskand ultimately the market has come around to that belief  i guess i have come to
the view that it is not a bad thing that the market reacted a bit more strongly  we probably should
have anticipated that and i think i even commented about it at the last meetingthat when you
make a change to open a twoway possibility for policy a little more explicitly it will have a bigger
impact on the overall market
third with regard to the discussion about the language in alternative b i was of the opinion
that in terms of growth we have a certain set of risks coming from the housing market and rising
energy and gasoline prices which to some extent was offset by continued strength in employment
the financial market adding to household wealth the growth around the rest of the world some
brighter picture from business investment spending and so forth  so i look at the growth part of
this as a bit more balanced and somewhat less uncertain than last time but at the inflation part as
being more uncertain  so i was attracted both to president sterns recommendation and even to a
recommendation that would replace section 3 of alternative b with section 3 of alternative c  but i
think about the chairmans most recent comments about how strongly the market might react to
that what it might say about what has been a nuanced discussion here about inflation  we all
expect inflationwe in boston somewhat less than the rest of youto moderate over the next year
or year and a half to something that is within what some people have called their comfort zone  i
am a little worried that we might send a message of more concern than we might have intended
from replacing that language although i agree with president stern  i think the language of
alternative c particularly with regard to uncertainty is somewhat more reflective of what we talked
around the table than the existing language of section 3
finally i may be kidding myself here but i have been taking the language in section 3 as
saying not so much that were committed to a comfort zone of between 1 and 2 although i take
president pooles comments on this seriously but rather that the dynamics of inflation had the risk
that inflation would accelerate rather than decelerate and that is what we were concerned about
again that is my personal reading on this because that is the context in which i think about
concerns about inflation at this time  i would agree with president poole that there is a way in
which you can read this that is gradually pushing us into giving a target and a target range and that
may be where everybody wants to go here  i do not know but i think there is a little risk around a
specific number as i have said many times  i would agree with governor kohn and his comments
about wondering whether we really want to push inflation just for the sheer sake of pushing it to
below 2 or rather waiting for the ability to move opportunistically at some point
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i support the recommendation embodied by
alternative b  the committee last time wanted to introduce a little more flexibility into the
statement while not sending a message that our resolve about achieving price stability had changed
it took a while for that message to get through but it did  since not much has changed in the way
the economy is unfolding relative to our expectations since the last meeting i would prefer to make
only the essential adjustments to the statement such as acknowledging the recent slowing in
economic activity  in the spirit of making only minimal changes i would not add the clause on
balance to the sentence on core inflation  we had the benefit of asking what we were trying to
convey with that phrase and heard vincents comments about timeseries and crosssectional
perspectives but the markets arent going to have the benefit of that explanation until they get the
minutes  i am also concerned that introducing the language about uncertainty around inflation is
going to have the markets trying to interpret what we are trying to say  they have a lower path to
the fed funds rate built into their expectations and i think they have been looking for language to
help support that position our saying that we are uncertain about inflation may appear to them as a
bit dovish rather than hawkish  so i would just rather keep things where they are today with very
few changes to our language  i support alternative b without on balance but that is obviously not
a show stopper  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like everyone else i support the policy
recommendation of alternative b keeping the fed funds rate unchanged  i do think that has the best
odds of helping the economy meet our dual objectives of maximum employment and stable prices
financial conditions right now as several people have remarked are really quite supportive of
growth particularly in the business sector but i think that is necessary to offset some of the drag
from housing and from business and household caution  the recent indicators it seems to me have
still a bit of a mixed character  we have one month of strength in capital spending and we have
some industrial production and ism data but consumption has definitely slowed down  so to my
mind there is still considerable uncertainty even if it is less than last time around the output path
given that i think things are close to where they were before i wouldnt make many
changes to the wording from last time  i am comfortable with section 2 on economic growth and
expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters unless we add something about uncertainty to
the inflation piece and then i would want to add uncertainty to the other  but i do not think we
ought to add the uncertainty language to inflation  i think the combination of that and the
predominant language as president fisher was implicitly pointing out will send a much more
concerned message about inflation  it will say that our concerns about inflation have increased
since last timei really think it would be interpreted that way  at some cost we obtained some
flexibility in how we are characterizing the situation and in our policy expectations by the changes
we made last time to the final section  i would keep that final section the same and i would not do
something to undo that which would be to combine the uncertainty language on inflation and the
predominant risk language  i think that the world would see the federal reserve as being much
more worried about inflation than it was last time even though the data have been a little better
on section 3 core inflation remains somewhat elevated on balanceone question i asked
myself was if i had a 2 percent target and the latest number was 21 should i be much concerned
about that or would i be comfortable with the sentence  i think i am okay with the sentence for a
couple of reasons  ill come to the on balance in a second  one reason is that the latest data on
core pce prices are heavily influenced by those nonmarket components that ive denigrated at this
table before and we can be consistent there  the yearoveryear cpi still shows some acceleration
much more acceleration than pce  the marketbased pce shows some acceleration  so the rate is
still higher than i am comfortable with especially when i discount the nonmarket part  the cpi is
still pretty high and i completely agree that inflation is our predominant concern  so i think saying
that core inflation remains somewhat elevated is fine with me  president poole said something
about that we as a committee continue with our comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent  for the sake of
the transcript i want to make it clear that the committee has never chosen such a comfort zone
several individuals have and i agree with both president poole and vincent that this could get
awkward soonbut not yetand we need to think about it  the committee does not have a
comfort zone  with regard to the phrase on balance i could live with the sentence either way
unfortunately its an ambiguous phrase  im not sure how people will interpret it  was the thought
that it would be more hawkish to take it out  i didnt follow the dialogue between vincent and vice
chairman geithner on what you thought the effect would be of doing the section without on
balance
mr reinhart  the theory was that you were smoothing through recent data so that if
you got another good reading on core inflation as you did last month you wouldnt necessarily
weight it as much
mr dudley  don you could take on balance as acknowledging last months data and
if you take on balance out youre not acknowledging last months data as much
mr reinhart  may i also just ask a question  in president sterns formulation you
would take the second sentence from alternative c and not make any reference to resource slack
so i would actually take that as markets reading that you have decided to totally discount the current
pressures on employment rather than increasing your weight on inflation uncertainty  i took this as
an invitation to say disregard employmentyou are not worried about slack as much and you are
just asserting that inflation moderates
mr kohn  i hadnt thought about that i confess  that makes me even more
uncomfortable
mr reinhart  i would view that as quite a dovish statement
mr stern  well i viewed it as a neutral statement  laughter
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  on the other side we are anticipating a slowdown in employment growth
so then the markets would look back to this and say aha the unemployment rate is risingthe
fed is about to ease  the question is whether this is a good time to get that notion out  i dont feel
very strongly one way or the other but i think there is a lot to be said for leaving it alone given all
the ambiguities here  but basically im supportive of president sterns recommendation
mr reinhart  i would note that bloomberg today had a linguist evaluate previous
statements and he basically concluded that the language was pretty hopeless  laughter
speaker  who was this linguist
mr reinhart  in fact it was the chief editor of the american heritage dictionary
mr moskow  can we hire him as a consultant  laughter
mr kroszner  a meteorologist and a linguist
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  anticipating that a linguist will be reading this afterward let me say that i
strongly support alternative b  since im assuming that the language is what were talking about i
support the current language even though there have been many suggestions for modifications  i am
not inclined to make any suggestions myself or to accept any of the others that have been put on the
table unless you as the chairman decide to modify this language somewhat
i have a couple of comments though  governor kohn mentioned that we would have a
long period in which we experience belowtrend growth but from my perspective thats what we
intend  we have had a period of modestly tight policy and therefore we should expect somewhat
belowtrend growth with the objective of bringing in our inflation numbers  we are right on track
with that and that is where we ought to be staying  i am very comfortable with this modestly tight
policy  over time it should systematically bring inflation down  i agree again with governor
kohns earlier comment that we can do it in this way with minimal cost to the economy which is
our objective  to bring inflation down and to do it in the least costly way possible  so we need to
stick with this policy as we have defined it here  i would also point out just for the record that if
you want to make sure that we are not getting tied up into targets as i have said before and will say
again today that i am not targeting on core pce  i much prefer core cpiit is more easily
understood  if that is the case then the 2 percent number if we have to talk about a number makes
a lot more sense  we can get this any way we want but the point is that we need to bring the
inflation numbers down systematically and we are not yet where i think most of us in this room
agree we should be  so where we are with the policy under alternative b is i think a very good
choice for us  i will end with that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as i listen to the comments around the table i
am of two minds  one and i have said this before maybe we ought to be in the business of
changing the statement a lot more frequently to get out of some of our traps of timeseries language
two having said that though i think as i indicated earlier that alternative b is the correct one
we ought to hold the fed funds rate where it is  we are about in the right place for now  there is
some question mark going forward in terms of how things evolve and where we want to be but for
now i am certainly comfortable where we are  if growth returns to trend more rapidly than the
greenbook projects then we might ask ourselves other questions but i dont think were there yet
acknowledging governor kohns comments i have to confess that i think that bills comments
indeed taken off vincesare appropriate  we need to align ourselves here better in terms of
where were going and what were doing  as we get closer articulating more precisely where we
are at least among ourselves becomes even more critical  aligning our objectives with market
expectations and figuring out how we get those things into alignment is a critical task that we face
and i just would like to reinforce that
in terms of wording i could live perfectly well with alternative b as written  i have a lot of
sympathy for president sterns statements  i would like to simplify our statements about inflation
in fact if people are troubled by the notion of uncertainty i would go so far as to stop after
inflation pressure seemed likely to moderate over time  i recognize that is probably not the
consensus view  as for the rest i kind of liked the chairmans suggestioni think it was hison
some of the language in section 2  in some ways if we dont want to convey much to the markets
at this point changing as little as possible seems to make sense and i would be supportive of that
in fact we could take the march statement in section 2 and leave it exactly as it is except to take out
to continue  but the chairmans suggestion about mixed signals would be fine with me too  so
im pretty flexible at this point  the real nut to crack will be coming up over the next quarter or
two when we will face some more difficult choices i believe  so ill end with that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  policy should be straightforward today  were waiting out a lull in growth
while inflation is unacceptably high at least to most of us  when the downside risks have
sufficiently diminished im presuming were going to want to take action to bring inflation down
but in the meantime we are on the sidelines obviously with regard to rates
coming into this i had thought the statement was going to be a pretty straightforward matter
as well  evidently not  markets finally figured out what we meant in the last statement  i think you
are right mr chairman in your autoregressive model of the statement language  the markets do a
kalman filter on whatever we issue and attach great importance to whatever we change  i do not
think much has changed about the outlook to warrant significant changes in language although id
be sympathetic to taking out on balance on the theory that it is a hawkish move in general
laughter  about what gary said i am really sympathetic to the notion of changing the way we
refer to the relationship between resource utilization and inflation in our statements  i say that
because the best mainstream understanding is that resource utilization and inflation are the joint
outcome of economic decisions given our actions and given what were expected to do  one can
talk about resource utilization affecting inflation  one can just as well talk about moderating
inflation keeping resource utilization high  there is really no superiority to one characterization or
the other  so the idea that a sort of independent thing is wagging around there driving inflation
rather than both of them being the result of our actions is an area in which we could improve the
publics understanding of our understanding of how monetary policy affects the economy
i would also like to endorse the spirit of president pooles remarks about inflation and what
we want  you know about this notion of opportunism or the idea of an interim target i think again
about my brotherinlaw sitting down in front of retirement planning software  i guess i would be
left telling him well you should put in between 1 and 2 depending on when we decide to take
the opportunity to reduce inflation below 2 percent  i do not think thats satisfactory  i think we can
do better  when we choose an objective we should view it as a onceandforall thing  part of that
reflects a sense that well if transition costs are something we are going to describe as keeping us
from going to where we now think we ought to be ultimately what if shocks bump us up to 2 or
3 percent  are we going to say the same thing then  i mean it is inviting people to think that and
it is just sort of painting ourselves into a corner  governor kohn you referred to the net welfare
costs of 2 versus 1 percent inflation  if you do the optimalpolicy calculation the only thing that
governs where you get in the long run no matter how long it takes is that net welfare calculation
so thats what should govern where we choose to set our objective not whether we think transition
costs are going to be high now or not  that concludes my remarks mr chairman
chairman bernanke  i think your point about joint causality joint endogeneity of
utilization and inflation is a good one  i have tried to make that point in testimony when i talk about
aggregate demand being strong and having effects both on inflation and on resource utilization  we
can think about this  it is a little hard to capture complex models in these statements but it is
certainly a point well taken  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i support the bluebooks alternative b both
the policy and the language as it stands  with respect to the language i strongly support the view
that you governor kohn and others expressedthat a change today would be a mistake given the
significance that the markets would attach to it  i think the language is completely acceptable and
we should stick with it  if we were to move i wouldnt have a problem with the language in c
about inflation and uncertainty but i would also want to add something about uncertainty with
respect to growth and i see no need to make this change today  it seems to me that we do need
considerable flexibility at this point to respond to emerging data  the intermeeting developments
have strengthened the case for a soft landing but there is significant risk on both sides with respect
to inflation and growth  im still comfortable stating that the predominant policy concern is the risk
that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  i am worried about labor markets that remain fairly
tight oil and commodity prices that are higher and the dollar which has fallen  at the same time
the recent favorable inflation data have reinforced my view that a substantial part of the uptick in
inflation last year was transitory  i think that the discussion we have had so far reinforces the point
that going forward we are going to have trouble crafting policy and a statement if we dont clarify
at least within the committee if not publiclywhat our ultimate inflation objective is  im not
going to weigh in again at this point on the merits but it is obvious that we will have increasing
difficulty  i am happy today to say that core inflation remains somewhat elevated on balance
but if we get more readings of core pce inflation that are in the neighborhood of 2 percent and they
continue we really will have to revisit the debate about what we want to achieve and how we can
reflect that decision in our statement
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  if you step back from the discussion and
just think about the policy position were in a difficult position because inflation continues to
run higher than most of us think is appropriate but economic activity seems to be in a soft patch
as you said in your summary of the comments mr chairman  i think alternative bkeeping
the fed funds rate at 5 percent and the languageis the appropriate one for today  if we were
to take the suggestion of using the sentence from alternative c about considerable uncertainty
surrounding the inflation judgment how would the markets interpret this change regardless of
how we meant it  i think the markets would immediately interpret it as less emphasis on
inflation from our standpoint  i think they would also say well theres now more uncertainty
or the fomc sees more uncertainty today about inflation than it did at the last meeting  i dont
think either statement is accurate
if we delete the phrase high level of resource utilization they will say that were less
concerned about high levels of resource utilization than we were before  weve had this phrase
in the statement for a long time  at some point we want to take it out but when we do the
change to the statement would be very significant  i wouldnt do it until we felt that in the
context of looking at the overall statement in a very careful way making that change had some
major benefit  there is a virtue in making few changes in the statement unless we have a
specific objective in mind or a specific message  so i would strongly oppose making that change
in the statement  on the phrase on balance i guess i was persuaded by vincents description
that this helps us give the impression that were smoothing through the recent data  so on
balance i would keep on balance  laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you
ms minehan  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  i realize that when i finished my comments i was never really clear
about language  after sorting through all the comments that people have made and my thoughts
about those comments i am perfectly happy with alternative b as it is written and with the on
balance language  i do want to say though that if we had replaced the language in section 3
with that about inflation pressures and uncertainty the juxtaposition of the sentence inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate over time but considerable uncertainty surrounds that
judgment indicates that the uncertainty relates to moderate over time and its clear that the
uncertainty is about inflation being higher rather than lower  that statement would be somewhat
more hawkish and in fact more reflective of where peoples balance of concern was  i am
totally in agreement that there is no need to change this language right now but i did want to
weigh in a bit there
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  well i too support alternative b and simple logic  we havent
arrived at the optimal picture yet  output growth is slowing inflation is still elevated and there
is a fair amount of uncertainty  some of us focused on uncertainty in the inflation picture and
some on both sides  i think the situation merits a patient approach at this juncture we should
give it some more time  regarding the language not being well schooled in the literary style of
the fomc i too focused on the on balance phrase thinking that it injected maybe a hint of
equivocation  i understand the logic  i believe what i heard president yellen saying is that we
have to think in a twostep process herethat is if you put it in and then the next time around
take it out how do the markets react  so for what its worth i focus on that not quite knowing
how to process the on balance language  otherwise im going to abstain from the language
debates here until i have a little more experience
vice chairman geithner  i dont know that it will help  laughter
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b and think that there is a
very heavy presumption against our changing the language much from our march statement
from all that ive heard today i dont think we have even convinced ourselves that we have
matched that presumption or overcome that burden of persuasion  so though ive had some
sympathy in isolation to the stern suggestion i dont think this is the right time to take it up in
light of our experience of the last statement  for several days we had the markets focused on us
rather than on the data  what you mr chairman and others have done over the most recent
period is to try to get the markets to be dependent on the data rather than to look at us  these
changes in languagewhether the stern amendment or something else at this pointdo just the
reverse of that  i dont think this is a good time for nuance in the markets and so i dont think
our substitution there would be good  i dont think we can agree even among ourselves what
the stern amendment would dowhether its hawkish or dovish and if we cant i hardly think
its a good prescription for us to send it out to the markets and have them figure it out for us
laughter
so i strongly favor alternative b  i think the markets will read the change in section 2
where we say economic growth slowed in the first part of this yearas we believe april as
well was quite mediocre  i think thats what it means  thats what we believe and so that
change is justified by the facts  in terms of the on balance language in section 3 i could live
either way but i dont see a compelling reason for adding on balance  i think the markets still
want to see in us a reflection of what they believe  they believe that were cutting that our
credibility on inflation is real but that were just being a little cute now  i wouldnt want to give
them an excuse to say that weve taken our foot off the accelerator that were less concerned
about inflation  it is just one data point so id prefer to leave it without on balance as it was
previously  thats it  thank you
chairman bernanke  i think you mean the brake  laughter  anyway thank
you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  as everyone else has said there havent been enough data to lead us
to change our view and the policy should remain where it is  alternative b is the right way to
go andi agree with governor kohnit is the best way to meet our dual objectives  the
statement from last time bought us some flexibility although at some costit left a bit of
confusion in the market which weve clarified  it is important for us to maintain that flexibility
and so in altering the statement we should think about that  in the first part of section 2 we do
have to acknowledge that growth slowed in the first part of this year  it is important to make that
change  but because we have made that change the chairmans suggestion seems quite
reasonable to merather than saying nevertheless just assert that recent indicators suggest
that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  i think the
chairman had suggested starting that sentence with overall  if people like the phrase on
balance we can say on balance recent indicators suggest that    laughter depending on
whether we choose to use the phrase on balance in the next sentence  on the next sentence
im open about whether we use on balance but i would on balance go for taking it out
because i dont see the particular benefit at this point of adding in that qualification  in some
sense it takes away a bit of our flexibility rather than adding to it  im trying to think about the
most likely scenarios going forward and its more likely that we might want to remove or alter
that phrase than keep it  so from our timeseries perspective going forward it might leave us a
little more flexibility not to put it in but i dont have a very strong view on that
as you can see from my comments i think that we shouldnt be changing things much
in principle im sympathetic to garys proposal but this is not the right time to make that
change  there is a question about the interpretation of high resource utilization  if we take
our central tendency discussion were going to see growth around 2 percent or so clearly below
potential  that doesnt suggest a high level of resource utilization  but given what the chairman
mentioned about likely changes in employment growth by the time we have our next meeting
we may be adding 01 or 02 percentage point to the unemployment rate and so it would be 03
percentage point higher than we were quite recently although its still broadly at a relatively low
level  the change would bring us back to a higher level than weve seen in quite a few months
we should just be mindful of that  im not suggesting that we take it out but we will have to
think about how to change it because the high level of resource utilization is not going to be there
by traditional measures  but most of us think that there is still a lot of potential to sustain those
pressures which may not just be the high level of resource utilization  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  obviously i support alternative b  it seems
from a policy perspective that our outlook hasnt really changed  we want to change as little as
possible in our statement  my sat scores in english were much lower than my sat scores in
math so im not going to comment on the issue of the phrase on balance  laughter  but let
me return to the issue that vince originally raised and that has come out from several of the
participants perspectives  i think we will soon be facing a very difficult situation  if the
forecast comes in along the lines that we expect which for us is a nice situation in which
inflation comes down to 2 percent in the core and looks as though it will stay therethat its not
just a temporary oneshot deal and that it will go back up againwere going to face a very
difficult issue in terms of the statement  unless i have a sense of the consensus on this
committee for what is our ultimate objective for inflation im going to have a real problem  my
view of where the number should be is that i lean toward 2 percent because i do think the
transition costs are important although i am concerned about the issue that president lacker
mentioned  we cannot be opportunistic and just change the number because as i mentioned
earlier that creates actually a very bad expectations dynamic which has the opposite effect of an
automatic stabilizer in terms of what happens to both inflation and output  if the committee
decides that 1 is a better number i could definitely live with that  that would make it easier
for me to deal with the statement because if were at 2 percent and have not built a consensus on
our ultimate objective for inflation then im going to be opposed to saying that inflation is
elevated and that would be an issue  if the committee does build a consensus that we should be
at a lower number than 2 percent then i would be comfortable with it  the reason i think this is
important is that well be forced into a discussion about this
the problem that will then arise is that if we have a consensus inside it will not be
transparent not to reveal that to the outside  so the issue is that whether or not we want to we
are going to be forced into a discussion about how we talk about our objectives on inflation and
we have to think very hard about it  we may not be there now but i actually hope we are
because i want inflation to come down  its going to be on the table and its going to be
complicated because weve had trouble building a consensus in the committee about this issue
but we need to be aware of the difficulties we will face  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i think were in a fairly good place in terms of the
policy and the signal  the language in march and in alternative b today preserves a nice balance
between the need to signal concern that we may not get as much moderation in inflation as wed
like and acknowledgement of some of the dispersion of views around the committee on what our
ultimate objective should be what our preferences are and over what period wed like to see
inflation come down to whatever level  it also gives us more flexibility  i would not want to
jeopardize that balance today  i dont see any compelling need to alter market expectations
today and as i said i am quite comfortable with alternative b
just on the latter deeper conversation about where were going in junethings will
change between now and june  june will be interesting i suspect even if it unfolds in the way
the forecast implies  but ultimately our judgment is about whether we have an acceptable
forecast for inflation  its whether the path going forward is acceptable to us in some sense and
thats what our discussion should be about  of course you cant separate that from where
inflation is today because thats where youre starting  but as rick and many others have
consistently reminded us the language is about the forwardlooking effects of policy today or as
they are built into market expectations or as we assume today for the expected path of inflation
going forward  but i like b and would be averse to changing it
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you for all the comments  on the
action i think were clear that we want to stay where we are  i just want to make the observation
that for almost a year now we have taken a very steady approach not only in keeping policy at a
given level but in terms of our rhetoric and in terms of our confidence in moderate growth and a
slow moderation of inflation  during the period the markets and the general view have gone up
and gone down and we have maintained a pretty even keel  that increases confidence in the
institution and unless we have a reason to change our view we should continue to stay on a
steady path
on the statement let me start with section 4 which i recommend we not change  the
response last time was a little noisier than i expected although i did expect some response  we
tried to do a number of things at once  we wanted to retain a balance of risks that emphasized
inflation risks but we also wanted to get away from forwarddirecting language  we wanted to
get away from what i think was an inaccurate suggestion that the next move was certainly going
to be up  in some circumstances for example we can effectively tighten by simply staying
where we are  we also wanted to convey that given the uncertainty we were experiencing some
more flexibility was needed  so it was a very complicated change to make  im not sure what
else we could have done  in any case i think we have the market in sync with our views and
therefore i would be very reluctant to go through that again to change the assessment of risk  so
im going to demonstrate a very conservative perspective today which probably wont surprise
you
on the rationale i think im okay with the second section as it stands  if youd note the
parallel to march the first sentence essentially indicated that we recognized what was going on
in the economy nevertheless we expected based on longerterm considerations and on our
thinking about the broad sweep of developments in the economy moderate growth going
forward  this does the same thing  we acknowledge whats going on  we saw slower growth
we see the housing sector  were not blind to current economic developments  nevertheless
we have good fundamental reasons to think that growth will be moderate  i wouldnt necessarily
reject my own suggestion to put in something about recent indicators but putting that in does
create a transitory kind of sense that were looking only at the last few numbers  i think its good
to project the sense that we have a long view and that we are comfortable with our long view and
are staying with it
ive been trying to decide what to do about on balance  a couple of thoughts  my
inclination after i listened to the conversationand i would be happy to take a poll or
whateveris to strike it on the following grounds  we are moving from a statement that said
recent readings on core inflation to one that says simply core inflation   the implication
there seems to me to be that were not referring now to the last couple of months but really to a
broader measure of core inflation  so again in a conservative spirit to avoid adding more
language i have a mild preference for dropping the phrase but im open to comment on that
with respect to the ongoing discussion about the implications of our language for an
inflation target we are going to have to address that  in a moment i will ask governor kohn to
talk a bit about communications  we will have a chance in our next meeting to talk about the
statement  i hope that in talking about the statement we can address issues such as how much
detail we should include how often we should change and how we should express the balance
of risks  obviously we wont be able to nail all of this down but we will have some opportunity
to try to come to a broader view about what the statements role would be in our larger
communication strategy  thats another reason to be slightly conservative at this point  but
thinking ahead president sterns suggestion about the sentence inflation pressures seem likely
to moderate over time but considerable uncertainty surrounds that judgment might be a place to
go at some point  we might want to change the derivative and instead of talking about the level
we could say that we are still expecting improvement but that there is a lot of uncertainty about
it  that sort of shifts it from level to direction  that might be a solution if we come to a point at
which we are at 2 percent or just below 2 percent  but i just raise that as a possibility
so in summary my recommendation is no action and alternative b as written striking the
phrase on balance  are there any comments in particular on the phrase on balance
president lacker
mr lacker  im against it
ms minehan  against eliminating it
mr lacker  no  against on balance
ms minehan  well thats your proposal right
chairman bernanke  yes my proposal
ms minehan  we are fine with your proposal
chairman bernanke  weve given up on english and have now gone to sign
language  laughter
mr kroszner  how will that be represented in the transcript  laughter
chairman bernanke  lets have a vote
ms danker  ill be reading the directive and the risk assessment from page 23 of the
bluebook  the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun
objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent
with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5 percent
the risk assessment  in these circumstances the committees predominant policy
concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  future policy
adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth
as implied by incoming information
chairman bernanke              yes vice chairman geithner      yes president hoenig                  yes
governor kohn                    yes
governor kroszner               yes
president minehan                yes
governor mishkin                yes
president moskow                yes
president poole                     yes
governor warsh                   yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  lets just take a moment to update the
communications situation and hear very briefly any comments on the dry run  but let me turn it
over to governor kohn for some comments
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i have just a few points building on what you
said a few minutes ago  just to clarify on the federal funds rate path  there was a consensus on
the committee not to publish the fed funds rate path so we are collecting that just to understand
what peoples policy assumptions are and how they fit into the forecast  there was a question of
whether we should assume appropriate policy or as the chairman had suggested whether we
should assume what you think the committee would do rather than what it should do  i think we
just need to think about what happened  well have another dry run in june  i think i would
collect those assumptions again in june  but when we go live once we decide how to focus this
policy we might or might not collect the fed funds rate assumptions  the problem with going
live and collecting the assumptions is that in five years they will be part of the public record  but
as long as were doing dry runs thats not the presumption  well find out something about how
the committee thinks and the committee can discuss how it wants to characterize its
assumptions
we can discuss our experience with this dry run now  however within the next couple
of days we will ask the staff to survey the committee about your reactions to how this went how
it could be improved what aspects were most and least helpful whether there are ways to use
this even more than we did in our policy discussion and if there are thingsnow that youve
been through it oncethat youd like to see from the staff that you didnt get  what about the
issue of circulating our individual submissions  should the staff extract key issues from those
submissions and circulate a list of key issues ahead of time  there are lots of things on which
we need to get your views before we formulate the june dry run  so you will have an
opportunity to make those comments in a formal way
as the chairman said in june we will go on to some of the other communication aspects
that we havent discussed before such as the timing of the minutes which will interact with this
minuteslike description that were doing of the projections and when the description needs to
be published in time for the chairmans testimony in july and february  theres a possibility of
moving that up  then how will all of this interact with the statement with the announcement  if
we go ahead with this forecast process well need to make sure that the statement conforms to it
regarding the statement there are lots of questions as the chairman was saying about the
balance of risks and how we characterize things  so i think we need to have a discussion of that
in june and it will be on the table in june
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for don or any comments
president plosser
mr plosser  i understand the concern about the fed funds rate assumption how we
interpret that and what we ought to do  i have two suggestions  one i still believe that it ought
to be part of the practice  ive expressed that view before  two at least for internal purposes
for this next dry run it would be helpful to get that information on funds rate assumptions back in
the writeup so that as we think about how this works we will have those data to look at and to
discuss at least in the context of what it looks like and how it might shape what were doing  i
know that vince gave us some indication of what people actually used when they submitted it
id just make a suggestion that in the next goround the information be included for internal
purposes just to see how it shapes our discussion
mr kohn  why dont we include that in the survey and see whether people want to do
it or not
mr plosser  fine
mr kohn  president lacker
mr lacker  id second being a little more transparent within the committee about
the fed funds rate  compared with other elements of the sausage factory that get revealed in the
transcript five years from now i dont see why that should be so sensitive  more broadly
though looking at these charts i was really struck by the dispersion of inflation forecasts for
2009  i would think we would be quite uncomfortable releasing that  the natural interpretation
of ones forecast for inflation at that horizon is going to be what ones objective for inflation is
and this portrays a committee that has not come to agreement on its objective for the central
thing that its responsible for controlling  given that i think that we want to come to closure on
this issue before we go live  indeed were doing a dry run without having gone through that  i
think the dry run after we go through that is arguably going to be different and to my mind this
argues for coming to closure sooner rather than later
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i just want to mentioni dont know if this is true of other people
that i had two big problems when i was doing this dry run  so though it will come out in the
survey i have a feeling that other people might have views on this  one problem was that i
really had difficulty thinking about the confidence interval because i didnt feel that i had
enough background from the staff about how to think about it  its not your fault because we
didnt ask you to do it  but here is my problem  i knew what the greenbook errors were in
terms of the confidence interval  i knew what the frbus confidence intervals were and then
there was an issue about how to think about them  i think there are things we can say about that
for example in the context of the frbus we dont assume any model uncertainty  so the
issue is that you think some more uncertainty might exist for the frbus errors but then there
are problems with the greenbook forecast errors which display greater uncertainty than the
frbus errors  so if we had a memo to really think this through it might provide a lot of
background for us to think about how we do this  we might need to do that before we go into
the next dry run so we can have some discussion about that
the other problem in figuring out what to write down is the issue of appropriate policy
which is central  again as relates to the issue that we just discussed i use an appropriate policy
of a 2 percent inflation goal because i think thats one that im comfortable with  its also
consistent with what i think revealed preference has been on this committee in terms of the
policy actions weve taken  however i would also be comfortable if the committee built a
consensus of 1 percent  then i would have had a different view in my projections because i
would have felt that the policies in that case would be different  so there is a question mark
about how to think about that in the future because it is the gray area that makes this exercise
more difficult  we do need to think about it  thats what i struggled with when i sat down and
asked how am i actually going to do this
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  you know were going to have to talk through a lot of
substantive issues on this  i thought if were going to do it lets do it now  but youve all
raised some of those questions  im looking at the clock  my suggestion is this  i dont know
what we are planning for junejune is a twoday meeting right
chairman bernanke  right
vice chairman geithner  so i dont think we can have these conversations
before the next round  lets make sure that we give ourselves time in june and beyond so we
can start to talk through thisso that those who didnt speak today about their initial reactions
arent left without the opportunity to engage in this because theres a whole range of things we
could address including the three issues raised so far
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  i take vice chairman geithners comments very seriously but i want
to raise just one thing because i would like it to get into the survey  we were offered one way of
reflecting uncertainty regarding forecasts  there might be other waysfor example alternative
scenarios qualitative discussions of risk or that sort of thingthat seem to some of us
preferable  if you can phrase a question that would draw out of us other ways in which we might
like to characterize the risks around our forecast i think that would be helpful because i for one
find the range of distribution of errors kind of difficult
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  just a logistical question don  on the survey i thought i heard you
say that you were going to send it out in the next couple of days
mr kohn  i would like to  i didnt look at vincent when i said that  laughter  i
mean i think we ought to get feedback soon
mr moskow  the only question i had is about the other iteration were going to go
through now commenting on the staff draft over the next two weeks  i think it would be good
for us to go through that experience before you send the survey out
chairman bernanke  good point  remind us when you can update your
projections
mr reinhart  through opening of business tomorrow
chairman bernanke  fine  so you have i guess the rest of the day to update
your projections if you like  laughter  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  i just want to underscore this point  its not at all clear to me that
providing the median of the 70 percent confidence bands is going to be useful to the markets  i
think that we have to think about what will be useful to the markets  it is important to convey
some sense of the uncertaintyand i very much look forward to the memo that rick asked for
but academics never think in terms of 70 percent confidence intervals they think about 90 or 95
percent confidence intervals  im not sure who besides readers of the bluebook and the
greenbook think in 70 percent confidence intervals  so thinking about alternative ways to
convey something useful to the markets about our sense of uncertainty without giving a false
sense of precision of 30 in 2008 and 34 in 2009 may be a better and more sensible way to go  i
think we look odd putting something like this out and im not sure it would actually be helpful
chairman bernanke  i just want to say that this exercise is already a success in
terms of the kinds of questions its making us confront  so i appreciate that everyone is taking
this very seriously  we had very good detailed responses from everyone
let me just close the meeting with a few quick announcements  first the next meeting is
two daysjune 27 and june 28  you will receive additional information about the nonpolicy
part of the discussion  second as usual on the night of june 27 well have a dinner at the
british embassy  a number of us have been concerned about the late night and so i had a
discussion with the ambassador and weve agreed that there will be no program or speaker
the evening will be strictly social and therefore maybe well get out a little earlier and have
more time to study the greenbook  laughter  third we circulated a set of proposed dates for
next years meetings  if you havent responded to vince or debbie please do so  there is lunch
available in the anteroom and the meeting is adjourned  thank you
end of meeting
