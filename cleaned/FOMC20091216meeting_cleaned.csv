transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on 
december 1516 2009 

december 15 2009afternoon session
 
chairman bernanke good afternoon everybody 
participants good afternoon 
chairman bernanke we need a motion to close our meeting 
mr kohn so moved 
chairman bernanke thank you our meeting today and tomorrow follows the basic sequence weve been having recently but with an important addition which is that we have a staff presentation on inflation dynamics  we need about two hours for that presentation i understand and weve thought about it and decided to put it at the end of the meeting so we would have plenty of time to complete our policy decision  but i hope that people will pay attention to the time and make sure we have enough time tomorrow to give appropriate attention to the presentation 
in that spirit why dont we start directly  mr sack 

mr sack1 footnote 1 the materials used by mr sack are appended to this transcript appendix 1 end footnote 1   since the last fomc meeting financial conditions have generally 
become more supportive of economic growth yields have declined at short and 
intermediateterm maturities and equity prices have posted a solid gain while the 
dollar has remained about unchanged on net  

some of the adjustment in financial markets appears to have been driven by 
increased confidence among investors that shortterm interest rates will remain low  
the repetition of the extended period language in the november fomc statement 
along with the additional clarity provided by including explicit conditioning factors 
seemed to solidify investors expectations that policy would remain on hold  
subsequent speeches by fomc members including comments that us asset prices 
do not look obviously out of line with fundamentals were seen as providing further 
support to that view in response the expected path of monetary policy derived from 
 futures quotes shifted down as much as 35 basis points over the intermeeting period 
as shown in the upper left panel 

the bluebook noted that these futures rates overstate what investors see as the most likely path for shortterm interest rates because they are influenced by the distribution of risks around that outcome  this point can be made by looking at options prices to derive the perceived probabilities of different outcomes for the shortterm interest rate as shown in the distribution to the right  according to that exercise the most likely outcome for the threemonth libor rate about ten months from now is that it will remain in the 25 to 50 basis point range  however given the proximity of that outcome to the zero bound the risk is skewed almost completely in the direction of higher rates pulling the mean of the distribution well above the mode  as a result the futures price which corresponds to the mean is about 50 basis points above what is seen as the most likely outcome 
with this consideration there does not appear to be much discrepancy left between marketbased measures of policy expectations and survey responses if the latter captures the modal outcome seen by respondents  our primary dealer survey indicates that the median respondent expects the first tightening to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010 with a range of views that spanned from the second quarter of 2010 to early 2012 
we also used the survey to query dealers about their interpretation of the extended period language used in the fomc statement  by far the most common response was that the extended period language would be removed three meetings before an actual rate hike we are happy to use future versions of the survey to quantify any timing of policy tightening that you wantsuch as some time a while before long or maybe to accommodate some committee members immediately laughter 
the lower expected path of monetary policy contributed to a decline in shorterterm treasury yields  this adjustment occurred even though the incoming economic data were generally stronger than anticipated  as shown in the middle left panel the twoyear yield fell about 10 basis points on net while the 10year yield posted a small increase  at one point over the intermeeting period the 2year yield had dipped to 65 basis pointsessentially equaling the lowest level on record as shown in the middle right panelalthough it has more recently retraced back above 80 basis points the 10year yield at just over 35 percent is also low by historical standards though it is still well above the levels reached at the end of last year   
yields remain at these low levels despite the fact that inflation concerns seem to be lingering some market participants continue to discuss whether the accommodative monetary policy stance and expansionary fiscal policy will eventually lead to upward inflation pressure  consistent with those concerns the 5year 5year forward breakeven inflation rate remains near the upper end of the range observed in recent years as shown in the bottom left panel 
while we recognize that technical factors can affect breakeven rates it seems that perceptions of inflation risk have at least contributed to their recent patterns  several observations support that view first flows into mutual funds that invest in inflationlinked products have increased notably over the course of 2009 indicating elevated demand for inflation protection among retail investors  second investors in the swaption market are paying an increasingly large premium for protection against a rise in longerterm interest rates which could in part reflect concerns about inflation expectations moving higher  however some of the other patterns associated with inflation jitters such as rising gold prices and a falling dollar have reversed course in recent weeks  we will be watching closely to see if that reversal is a temporary head fake or a more persistent shift in trend  
looking across global sovereign debt markets we find that another factor that has recently come into play is the perceived risk of default  given the fiscal challenges facing a wide range of countries investors have been reevaluating their views on sovereign default risk one measure of this risk albeit an imperfect one because of the limited size of the market is the pricing of cds on sovereign debt  as shown to the right there has been considerable upward pressure on the yields of greek debt as markets have grown concerned about the prospect of default  similar concerns have been expressed about spain and ireland and the fiscal situations in the us and the uk have also been discussed in this context  however to date there appears to have been little upward pressure on us yields from this factor 
overall any upward pressure on treasury yields arising from investors concerns about longerterm inflation risks or the fiscal outlook is being dominated by the downward pressure arising from the prospect of low shortterm interest rates for an extended period leaving treasury yields quite low 
turning to the next exhibit better economic news and the prospect of accommodative shortterm interest rates contributed to a further advance in the prices of some risky assets  most notably broad equity indexes posted another sizable gain since the last fomc meeting with the sp 500 index up more than 5 percent on net 
one of the issues that i have addressed in recent briefings is whether risky asset prices have risen too far to help make this judgment we can look to valuation models such as the boards measure of the equity premium  this premium shown to the right still appears wide by historical standards suggesting that the runup in equity prices since earlier this year has not pushed them too high relative to fundamentals  similarly an analysis of corporate bond spreads suggests that their risk premiums are also not unusually narrow 
another approach to address this issue is to look across asset classes in order to see if all risky assets are rising as such a pattern could imply an indiscriminate increase in risk tolerance on the part of investors  correlations in the movements across various asset classes reported in the middle left panel have been unusually high over the past six months compared with their levels a few years ago with increasing equity prices strongly associated with rising emerging market equity prices rising commodity prices and declining corporate yield spreads  to be sure this pattern could result from a variety of factors such as the considerable change in the economic outlook and the easing in financing strains  however some might take this pattern as indicative of a large shift in risk preferences that if carried too far could be associated with speculative excesses 
the current intermeeting period provides some relief from this pattern though  even though equity prices charged ahead they did not pull all risky asset prices with them  indeed corporate bond spreads shown to the right appear to have leveled out to a considerable degree moreover yield spreads on commercial mortgagebacked securities the bottom left panel have widened since the summer and abs spreads across most other asset classes have also edged higher recently  thus the performance of risky assets has been mixed  in addition even though the events associated with the debt standstill by dubai world were not a primary driver of these price movements they provided a reminder to investors of the need to assess credit risk and differentiate across borrowers 
banks in particular continue to be wary of taking additional credit risk onto their balance sheets they have continued to tighten the terms on many types of lending and the volume of bank loans has continued to contract  these patterns contrast sharply with the narrowing of credit spreads in capital markets since earlier this year and the robust issuance of corporate bonds that has taken place in recent months  bank equity prices shown in the bottom right panel were mixed over the intermeeting period  the recent focus of the market has been on the efforts by bank of america citigroup and wells fargo to repay tarp funds as investors weigh the advantages of escaping tarp against the dilutive effects of the capital increases required to do so 
the next exhibit addresses the feds largescale assetpurchase programs  the desk has been tapering its purchases of mbs and agency debt as shown in the top two panels but despite the slower pace our purchases continue to put pressure on these markets  the available supply of mbs in the market has been limited as seasoned bonds seem to be largely locked up in portfolios and new originations have been relatively light 
given these market dynamics our purchases have produced a further richening of mbs and agency debt relative to treasury securities as can be seen in the yield spreads shown in the middle panels  indeed the concern among market participants that these spreads would widen as the fed pulled back from its purchase programs has not yet materialized  market participants continue to raise this concern however with many expressing a view that the mbs spread to treasuries could quickly rise by 25 to 50 basis points from its current level  accordingly we will continue to watch for such developments as our purchases decline further 
of course winding down our purchases of assets is just one dimension of managing our balance sheet  the evolution of financial market conditions will depend on all decisions influencing the size and composition of the balance sheet going forward 
in that regard the committee faces a key policy issue namely setting the appropriate strategy for either redeeming or reinvesting maturing soma holdings  like asset sales redemptions of soma assets allow policymakers to shrink the balance sheet simultaneously reducing excess reserves and reversing some of the portfoliobalance effects that resulted from the lsap programs  this outcome may be seen as desirable depending on the evolution of economic and financial conditions 
the figure in the bottom left panel shows the profile of remaining maturities for our holdings of treasury and agency securities as well as the pattern of principal payments that we anticipate on our holdings of mbs  the mbs profile is based on a prepayment model that incorporates a marketbased forecast of interest rates and it should be noted that there is a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding those estimates  those mbs payments would come on top of the nearly 50 billion of prepayments that we have already experienced to date and which we have not reinvested 
the table in the bottom right panel shows the path of the size of the feds balance sheet under several possible redemption strategies  the first row assumes full reinvestment of all soma securities which would require the lsaps to be expanded to replace the mbs prepayments and agency debt maturities already received  this strategy would leave the size of the portfolio steady at 22 trillion through 2011  the second row assumes that the desk redeems all agency securities that mature and all mbs that are prepaid while following its usual practice of reinvesting treasury holdings this strategy allows the balance sheet to shrink gradually providing about 350 billion of redemptions relative to the full reinvestment strategy by the end of 2011 the third row shows the effects of redeeming all soma holdings including treasury securities this strategy reduces the balance sheet by over 500 billion by the end of 2011 of course other strategies could also be used under which only a portion of the treasury portfolio would be reinvested 
at this point the desk only seeks to verify the committees preference to allow mbs and agency debt to run off the balance sheet without replacement  as noted this is the approach that has been taken to date with the prepayment of mbs and it is the approach that was taken with the agency debt security that matured on december 10 the first security purchased under the lsap programs to mature  going forward the flow of maturing agency securities and prepaid mbs will become more substantial adding to the importance of deciding upon the redemption strategy 
reaching a decision for handling treasury securities is less pressing as the desk has a longstanding practice of routinely reinvesting existing treasury holdings and can continue to do so for now however policymakers may want to revisit the redemption strategy for treasury securities before long as it gives them more scope to achieve different balance sheet outcomes 
your final exhibit covers the behavior of shortterm interest rates and discusses the markets views on some of the feds exit tools  as shown in the upper left panel the feds balance sheet expanded modestly since the last fomc meeting reflecting further increases in our asset holdings accumulated under the lsap programs  the balance sheet currently stands at 22 trillion with 18 trillion of that corresponding to our holdings of treasury agency and mortgagebacked securities 
partly as a result of the growth of the balance sheet the amount of excess reserves in the banking system has also increased and currently stands at about 11 trillion as shown to the right with that large amount of liquidity in the system the federal funds rate has remained persistently below the interest rate paid on excess reserves or the ioer rate 
it is useful to look at this relationship between excess reserves and the federal funds rate as a scatter plot shown in the middle left panel for the period since last december  as can be seen there has been a downward slope to the relationship although it is very small in magnitude  when excess reserve balances were around 600 billion the spread between the federal funds rate and the ioer rate tended to be limited  as reserves have increased towards and now beyond 1 trillion the spread has grown to a typical level of 10 to 15 basis points  of course a key area of uncertainty that policymakers face is the extent to which this relationship will shift as the ioer rate increases 
given the large amounts of reserves and the behavior of shortterm interest rates market participants are increasingly asking for more information about the fomcs exit strategy they are particularly focused on the likelihood sequencing and size of various policy actions such as draining reserves increasing the ioer rate and selling assets we asked a number of questions in our dealer survey to gauge their own views on these issues 
the survey results indicate that about threequarters of the respondents expected the fed to use temporary reservedraining tools either reverse repos or term deposits before any increases in the policy rate the remainder expected reserve draining and policy rate increases to begin at the same time and no respondents expected the policy rate to be raised before any draining operations took place  based on the median of all responses the initial use of reverse repos and term deposits was expected to take place in the third quarter of 2010 while the first policy tightening was expected to take place in the fourth quarter as noted earlier in the briefing 
some additional information on the expected path of these tools is presented in the lower left panel as can be seen reverse repos and term deposits are both expected to ramp up through the second quarter of 2011 and to edge up further into 2012 by the middle of 2012 the respondents expected about 300 billion of 
outstanding reverse repurchase agreements and 200 billion of term deposits  about 
half of the respondents also expected asset sales to be used bringing the average 
expected path of sales above zero however as can be seen asset sales were 
expected to be increased more slowly  lastly about half of the respondents also 
expected sfp balances to be raised from their current level and hence to remove 
reserves  

based on the use of all of these tools respondents on average expected the fomc 
to drain several hundred billion dollars of reserves before the first policy tightening 
leaving the amount of excess reserves at that time below 1 trillion  however as 
shown by the distribution in the bottom right panel there is a fairly wide range of 
views on that outcome  respondents also expected the fomc to continue draining 
reserves even after an increase in the policy rate but their responses suggest that a 
decent amount of excess reserves would still be left in the system through at least 
2012 

let me close with a brief note about yearend effects which are not covered in 
your charts we continue to monitor yearend pressures and the potential 
consequences for markets  as i discussed in my last briefing we are not seeing any 
upward pressure on unsecured lending across yearend the traditional yearend effect 
in markets presumably as a result of the substantial amount of liquidity in the 
markets  instead yearend pressures seem to be most evident in strong demand for 
riskfree assets spanning yearend which has put significant downward pressure on 
shortterm treasury yields  for example the implied forward rate from treasury 
bills for the week spanning yearend has been consistently negative for several 
months and last weeks auction of the fourweek bills stopped out at a rate of 
precisely 0 however the downward pressure on rates does not appear to be 
intensifying or causing significant market disruption and thus does not clearly 
necessitate a policy response 

one development that could alleviate some of the market pressure is issuance of sfp bills ahead of yearend  if the debt ceiling is increased soon by a sizable amount the treasury will likely auction sfp bills in the last week of the year  those auctions would be part of a broader plan to return sfp balances to 200 billion  however given the politics surrounding the debt limit decision this outcome is at best uncertain at this point thank you  that concludes my prepared comments 
chairman bernanke thank you brian youre right that we need to be thinking as a committee about the sequencing of how we will remove the policy accommodation  my thought on this had been that we needed to wait until we had a somewhat clearer idea of what the timing of the availability of the tools was going to be  im asking brian sack and brian madigan whom i have not warned about this questiondo you think that january might be a time when we could at least begin a discussion on this at the committee level  will we have enough information about our tools 
mr sack yes i think well have enough information  there will certainly be details about the tools that were still working out but i think well have some information on their scope for reverse repos in particular we essentially already have the capacity to do the amount of reserve draining that was indicated in the survey  so i wouldnt argue for putting off that more strategic debate in order to hammer out every last detail of the tools i think its probably time to move forward with that 
chairman bernanke okay so no later than january we will put this on the agenda for discussion 
mr plosser mr chairman 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr plosser i think it is important to do that in january  but i would just like to emphasize that in the context of that and thinking about sequencing i think it would also be very helpful to think about what we believe the steadystate policy tools are going to be that is how are we going to conduct policy in normal times going forward with interest on reserves  and i think it is important to have that discussion but in the context of thinking about how we use the tools and the way we use these tools interacts with where we ultimately want to end up in how we conduct policywhether it is a floor system or a corridor systemand what we think is going to happen to the funds market  i think these things are tied together and id like to see that discussion carried on in tandem if we can 
chairman bernanke the point is well taken  i guess i would say that given all of these important decisions maybe we should all try to minimize excessive speculation in public about this subject until we as a committee have come to more clarity on sequencing  but these are issues we need to address very soon so thank you for that 
on the issue of reinvestment let me just add this one other option i can think of which is to reinvest in bills this gives you maximum flexibility if you want to drain quickly 
are you looking for some kind of committee guidance at this point or are you going to come back to us 
mr sack i would just like to make sure that everyone is on board with running down the agency and mbs holdings or at least doing that as an interim strategy  in terms of a strategy for the entire portfolio or a strategy to be used beyond the near term i think that yes we should come back and have a full discussion and one that probably to some degree folds in the issue of asset sales because obviously redemptions accomplish many of the things that asset sales accomplish 
one way to think about the redemption strategy is that it is in some sense a commitment strategy to convince the markets that you are not going to shed your portfolio too quickly  so one question i think we should consider is  if there are other ways to make that commitment then do asset sales give us more flexibility obviously what is somewhat odd about redemptions is the flip side of that which is that this decision about how quickly to shrink the portfolio is governed by other factors that are uncertain and that could change and so on  so i would like to give it full consideration along with the discussion of whether there is any strategy through which we could sell assets safely in some regard 
chairman bernanke well again use of bills could smooth out the path if you thought the redemptions were too quick for example 
mr sack absolutely 
chairman bernanke if anyone has concerns about letting things mature as an interim strategy you should mention that in our discussion 
before i open the floor for questions for brian the vice chairman had an introduction he would like to make 
vice chairman dudley i wanted to introduce steve friedman from the markets group in new york steve runs the forex area  so hes partners in crime with mr sheets on swaps and other things welcome steve 
chairman bernanke welcome  okay questions or comments for brian governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  brian on panel 29 the orange line for asset salesthat is understood by dealers to be sales and not just the runoff through maturation of these securities 
mr sack thats correct though i think one shortcoming of the survey as we designed it is that we didnt actually ask about redemptions so i think we will do that in the future  but this question was phrased to be explicitly about sales  a few dealers volunteered views on redemptions under the category of other but i think in the future well be more careful about trying to get their views on their expectations about the redemption strategy 
mr tarullo all right i think you just answered my next question which is  at this juncture youre not certain as to what the dealer views are on what our redemption default position is 
mr sack i would strongly guess that the consensus expectation is that the agency and mbs will be run off and the treasuries will be reinvested but ill have more confidence in that if we measure it in the next survey 
mr tarullo thank you 
chairman bernanke president rosengren 
mr rosengren just a question on panel 28 is the policy rate that theyre talking about there the fed funds rate or the interest rate on reserves 
mr sack its the federal funds rate  i think its likely that market participants see those two the federal funds rate target and the ioer rate moving in tandem  but again we didnt explicitly get that from the surveythe survey asks about timing of policy tightening in terms of an increase in the federal funds rate target 
mr rosengren so no dealer raised the question of whether you would just move the interest rate on reserves but not do anything else for example 
mr sack they did not but again i think we could incorporate that in future surveys  i also think that if were very interested in gauging the markets views on all of these issues obviously there may be a few survey issues to clean upwe also might want to consider doing a broader survey this is a survey of the 18 primary dealers  its answered mainly by the economists at those primary dealers  were not convinced that they have the same views as the traders or as a broader set of financial firms  so if there is a lot of interest in gauging these expectations i think we could make a more extensive effort for the next meeting 
chairman bernanke governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i wondered brian if you could talk a little bit about the cmbs market and the talf and particularly new cmbs  i guess the issuance has been limited under the talf  why is that and what are the prospects 
mr sack as you know the november talf subscription included the first newissue cmbs deal the ddr deal  that seemed to have some positive effect on the market even though we ended up taking only a small amount of risk i think on the portfoliothe amount of the loan was only 72 million  the deal was very well received and seemed to initiate some activity in the market  since then weve seen two other new singleborrower issues come to market 
mr kohn through talf 
mr sack no not through talf outside of talf  and we hear reports of a handful of other issues also being prepared to come to market  of course this is still a trickle of issuance compared with where we were several years ago so i think the market is still extremely impaired but showing some signs of life 
mr kohn are there signs that more are going to bring it to talf 
mr sack i think talf has been a very important factor in bringing this activity back and will continue to be for as long as its in place  but at the same time i think there has been a surprise at how strong the demand has been for the issues  so maybe thats the most encouraging signnot only did talf get a deal done but it brought some activity back to the market even independent of talf  we see that as a very positive sign 
mr nelson id add just a few things the two deals that were priced had been in the talf pipeline so they were thinking of making them talfeligible and they decided having observed the reaction to the first deal it was possible to go ahead without that  the other thing is that half of the loans that were taken out for ddr have actually been repaid already that is half of the 72 million finally yesterday was the december cmbs subscription and there were no newissue cmbs brought to that subscription 
mr sack let me add a few more things  we have begun to ask market participants about their expectations for the market to try to assess how dependent it is on talf  weve asked a very small set of market participants so take all of these responses with a grain of salt  the general view was that cmbs spreads would widen once the talf expired and indeed in secondary market trading we do see some difference between similar deals that are talfeligible and not talfeligible so it does appear based on that evidence that the talf is having an effect on keeping spreads narrower than otherwise 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans thank you brian actually you began to answer my question on the primary dealers  i realize after listening to and seeing presentations like this i didnt really know who the survey respondents were  is it really bank economists  i thought this was more financial market participants  i guess the question is  if it is bank economists is it really that different from say the blue chip or nabe or something like that 
mr sack its very hard to gauge  we know the survey is filled out by a lot of economists but they sit on trading desks and talk to traders  so its somewhat mixed i would say in terms of what you are actually getting 
mr evans do you have any idea if its consistent from time to time or do they mix it up 
mr sack my impression is that its consistent  at the new york fed we also interact with a separate group of advisers who are from the buy side and weve been experimenting with running a similar survey out to that group where we clearly would be reaching investment managers  as we move into 2010 we hope to bring that product on line as a marketsource piece for exactly this purpose that is to broaden our reach in these surveys  i think the surveys are proving very valuable in being able to address key policy issues so i think we want to maximize their effectiveness 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley as one of those people who used to receive those surveys i know that they usually go to the economists who sit on the desk  if theyre uncertain about how to answer the question theyll talk to the traders  so i think theres probably a little gap between the economists views and the traders views but generally the traders are consulted 
chairman bernanke president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  brian a couple of questions that are triggered by the slides but you may want to wait until next month to answer them  looking at slide 23 if we wanted to shift this maturity schedule could we trade within the portfolio to adjust the way that maturity schedule looks 
mr sack yes you certainly could even say within a certain asset class like treasuries you have options such as those that came up earlier like redeeming longerterm securities and reinvesting shorterterm ones or even reinvesting longerterm ones into shorterterm securities  there are some limits on doing that at auction but you could always do that in the secondary market as well  the same is true for mbs  theres nothing in theory that prevents us from selling mbs and purchasing treasuries or trying to reallocate across asset classes i think there would be obvious challenges to doing any of that in terms of communicating to the markets what youre doing and wed have to be very careful in that communication but it could be done 
ill also say that theres a lot of concern in the markets about sales of mbs  weve bought a lot and weve been the dominant player in the market  the market is concerned about adjusting to our not being there as a steady purchaser and i think the idea of our being there as a net seller of mbs is a concern to some  so while all of these strategies are possible i think wed have to be very careful about what we were trying to achieve and make sure the market understood it 
mr lockhart a second question if i may according to slide 30 if i understand it correctly a great majority of respondents believe that we would start tightening the fed funds rate target while we have relatively high levels of excess reserves  how are they thinking and how are you thinking about how the fed funds rate market works in the condition of high reserves 
mr sack again we didnt get into that level of detail  i think the presumption would be that they understand that interest on excess reserves is a tool that can raise all shortterm interest rates even with a large amount of reserves in the system  in this response theyre implicitly saying that that mechanism will work or at least that policymakers think it will work with a relatively high degree of reserves or at least that policymakers will begin to tighten and see if it works 
mr lockhart so if we raise the interest rate on excess reserves the fed funds rate will follow to an extent 
mr sack right i think thats the general perception although as i noted in the text theres a lot of uncertainty if you look at panel 27 we know that with all of these excess reserves the funds rate has been soft to the ioer rate  i think a real key policy question is  is that spread steady  if that spread is steady10 to 15 basis pointsthen it seems that policymakers have very effective control of shortterm interest rates even with the amount of reserves indicated in the lower right panel  theres just no way to measure empirically whether that spread will be steady because weve only had this period of high reserves when weve been pinned up against the zero bound so that is i think a key policy question 
chairman bernanke president fisher 
mr fisher thank you mr chairman  just a quick question on slide no 29  what do you guess that slide would have looked like before we began testing reverse repos as an exit strategy 
mr sack i think your question raises a general issue about the fact that were doing a survey with the firms we have been interacting with the most in terms of setting up the reverse repo program there was some concern on our end about whether that was biasing the results in this direction  so i think that argues for the wider survey 
having said all of that when we speak to market participants outside of the primary dealers theres just an incredible amount of focus on reverse repos and i am not sure why that is relative to term deposits  so i think broadly speaking market participants really do expect reverse repurchase agreements to be a key part of the policy tools  of course in this response both reverse repos and term deposits are being used very actively  reverse repos are a little bit higher but theyre both very active draining tools  it may be that asking the dealers puts a little bit more focus on reverse repos but im not sure  i wouldnt want to say that this probably does not represent the broader review i think that if we could make an effort to find that out through a broader set of participants then i wouldnt be surprised if it comes out similarly 
mr fisher thank you 
chairman bernanke president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  first just a followup on that last point  i think the dealers are focusing on reverse repos because thats what they hear us talk about most of the time  we havent talked as much publicly about the term deposits or asset sales  so i think we sort of get back from them what we say at times and we have to be a little bit careful interpreting that just as an observation 
on redemptions and so forth i tend to think we are going to have to shrink our balance sheet and i think your memo very effectively focuses our thinking about the optimal size of our balance sheet and how we want to think about that  we have walked up to this question over and over again over the last year and a half and really havent come to grips with what the answer is but this sort of raises that question foursquare and i think its important that we think about that  i think the direction going forward is that the balance sheet is going to get smaller rather than larger so im in favor of letting them all run off  in terms of treasuries i do think at some point as the chairmans comment suggested if we get back to a soma portfolio that looks more like it used to look were going to have to start substituting shortterm for longterm  i dont know that we need to do that initially but certainly that would be a possibility 
back to the sequencingagain i think these things interact with one another  we have two other things affecting the overall balance sheet  one is the runoff in the liquidity programs  another issue which we havent returned to is the sfp  whats going to happen to it is it going to come back  how is that going to effect our balance sheet and how would that interact with all of this  so i think theres a whole complex set of interactions that we need to be thinking about thats why i commented earlier about the need to discuss our views on how we implement policy going forward sort of a new steady state  how we get to that steady state is combination of these things  i dont think we can think about them in isolation 
so if you have got some observations about the sfp id love to hear them too 
mr sack first let me respond to your point on communications about reverse repos versus other tools such as asset sales or the term deposit facility  i think in part that has been a result of the timing  the reverse repo tool for the treasury and agency collateral at least has progressed more quickly and we wanted to go ahead and test it so you do have a situation where weve had more communications about that  i think well seeand jim clouse will talk about thismore communication on the term deposit facility going forward and so some catchup in that regard 
on the sfp i thought the survey results were interesting  roughly speaking half of the respondents thought it would just stay at 15 billion and the other half thought it would be ramped back up to 200 billion  our thinking was that with an adequate increase in the debt limit which as of yesterday we thought we were probably going to get sfp would run back up to 200 billion over a relatively quick time framefour to six weeksand to a point where we had a nice evenly spaced maturity distribution that would then just roll over and keep that size  more recently it looks like the debt limit may be raised by a much more limited amount only enough to provide room for several months in which case it would be very hard to run up the sfp because it would immediately have to be run back down  but i think that absent that constraint our inclination is to have treasury run the sfp back up and that obviously would keep it as a policy tool that could be used if needed at some point in the future  theres no reason 200 billion is the right number but i think that decision would have to be made in conjunction with our assessment of the effectiveness of the other tools in terms of getting reserves out 
mr plosser but i think thats why this is important  the sfp got run down on us which was implicitly an increase in our balance sheet and in excess reserves that we did not necessarily elect to have happen the discussion earlier on this was that it was going to come back up again what i hear is that it may not go back up which in my view would strengthen the case for letting some of these other things mature and run off as opposed to reinvesting them because excess reserves are already higher than we thought they would be in the initial goaround of asset purchases 
chairman bernanke a lot depends on where you think our policy is working  if its working on the asset side and the amount of mbs we buy is what really matters then the amount of excess reserves is just kind of a residual and its not doing much independently 
mr plosser fair enough 
chairman bernanke but there are a number of different ways to think about it 
president hoenig 
mr hoenig thank you mr chairman this question is more for you  your comment at the outset and then president plossers reaction to it was describing a discussion that would take place in january  im not clear on how you are outlining the policy discussion that might take place in january versus perhaps now and if you could clarify that for me that would be helpful 
chairman bernanke sure i was just responding to the comment myself but there are two separate questions  one question is how accommodative policy should be and that has to do with the outlook for the economy and inflation and so on  but there are also what you might call the technical questions and in particular given that we want to unwind accommodation what would be the appropriate sequencing in terms of the tools that we use  should we for example drain reserves first and then raise the interest rate on reserves if we drain reserves first which particular tools should we use and in what combination  president plosser pointed out that thats also linked to the question of what our official target is  we may simply want to announce that we are raising the interest rate on excess reserves and make no comment whatsoever about the federal funds rate because the control of the federal funds rate may be loose and may not be that meaningful an interest rate given the nature of that market now 
so again i want to separate the question of when and how quickly we should be removing accommodation from a more technical set of questions about whether there is a preferred sequencing or combination that is in some sense independent of the policy decision itself there may not be  it could be that those two things are so intertwined that we just have to decide on them jointly but it is certainly worth the discussion 
mr hoenig i agree i would assume that we could at this meeting hint about our preferences as we look forward to january because of the very developments that are taking place now in the economy and not just wait until january for their discussion 
chairman bernanke no im sorry i didnt mean to prohibit discussion but what i was saying is that to the extent that there is a technical question it would be useful to have some staff input and a chance to think about it in advance 
mr hoenig absolutely i agree with that thank you 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker ill pass honest laughter 
chairman bernanke president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you i think this follows up on the point about the meeting that well have in january to discuss tools and sequencing  brian on your chart 27 my staff had conducted a similar analysis  they used the dates from december 2008 through current period and found that there is a closer correlation between the effective fed funds rate and interest on reserves when excess reserves are under 800 billion  it is not as clear on your chart as it was on the chart that my staff prepared  is this a useful analysis as we start to think about the tools and sequencing  when excess reserves are closer to 800 billion will the interest on reserves then be a more effective tool 
mr sack that sounds right  i actually took this chart from some work being done by jamie mcandrews and other staff at the new york fed  and i know there is similar work going on at the board and probably a number of other places  that work tried to fit a demand schedule through here and its a nonlinear demand schedule  as you suggest it has more elasticity at lower levels of reserves and then flattens out that work has a lot of other interesting results including looking at whether gse balances have a special effect relative to the overall level of reserves  so i would expect hopefully that some of that work will be presented in whatever material is prepared for the next meeting 
chairman bernanke president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota thank you mr chairman  brian what is the desks position if any on the effect of the term deposit facility and reverse repos on shortterm interest rates suppose we start running a term deposit facility  what kind of effect do you foresee that having on the level of shortterm interest rates  or is it just going to be totally disconnected or do you think there is going to be some passthrough or what 
mr sack i think one thing it clearly does is pull reserves out of the marketless reserves available for overnight lending means youll bring shortterm interest rates up  thats exactly whats shown in exhibit 27 that is the idea that those tools could be used to get to a lower level of reserve balances and bring these other shortterm interest rates up closer to and maybe more connected to the ioer rate  i think thats the main effect 
one question we wrestled with especially with reverses is whether theres an independent effect a direct effect on rp rates  if we drain 300 billion of reserves by dumping a bunch of collateral into the rp market do we not only get the effect in exhibit 27 but do we also get further upward pressure on the rp rate from that collateral  i think we see that as a possibilitythat is you could actually get some further upward pressure on rp rates relative to overnight rates i think that would tend to be transitory but certainly if that collateral were dumped quickly that could happen  but generally speaking and over longer periods of time we think the main effect comes via affecting the amount of liquidity available in the overnight lending market in which case draining enough liquidity tends to pull rates up towards the ioer rate 
mr kocherlakota so youre not worried about these programs basically being an influence on shortterm interest rates beyond the ioer rate  thats what i would be concerned about youre just saying we are moving the fed funds rate closer to the ioer rate  thats fine with me  im more worried that theyre going to be a separate influence on shortterm interest rates beyond the ioer rate 
mr sack well i think at some point if the size is large enough then yes you could pull shortterm interest rates above the ioer rate  im making an assumption that the size of these programs will be calibrated to some objective whether that objective is getting the other rates around the ioer rate or not  so the size will be endogenous to the framework that the fomc lays out 
mr kocherlakota well the description of the tdf involved an auction so sometimes it can be hard to know exactly what price youll get out of that i would guess 
mr sack thats right theres going to be analysis and judgment but of course in the old days when we did temporary operations every day there was always assessment and judgment about how much operations were needed 
chairman bernanke we will be hearing about the tdf in just a moment  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  brian i just wanted to make sure i understand exhibits 19 and 20 and the effects of tapering  were tapering now and weve gotten some distance along that path i guess these charts right below are meant to say that the effects have been minor or there havent been any effects even though people in the market said oh youre going to back up these rates  is that a fair assessment 
mr sack yes exactly 
mr bullard okay but nevertheless they think if we keep going then youre going to get a big effect at some point in the future 
mr sack thats right 
mr bullard okay so theyre sticking to their story  laughter 
mr sack theyre sticking to their story 
mr bullard and were going to watch it because were going to be tapering for another 90 days or so 
mr sack thats right our purchases have declined but conditions in the market have been very tight its not just that the assets didnt cheapen but they have actually richened in terms of the spread narrowing further  so we havent seen any signs of what we and the markets worried about as we backed away from this 
now there are a lot of things going on in markets  theres not a lot of supply coming into the market  we are approaching yearend and so on  so well wait and see but so far there are no signs that there is any increase in rates from our pulling back 
mr bullard okay so i have just one question on the survey  you say selling assets well what do you mean selling assets  if you say youre going to dump 1 trillion worth of mbs onto the market yes thats going to have a big effect  but if you sell it in some measured way that makes sense then it seems like these are the right pictures to be thinking abouta first pass at how that would happen 
mr sack yes in my view a big chunk of the question about asset sales is  can we do them in a way that doesnt cause a sharp backup in rates whether thats a precommitment to a gradual sales pace or whether its building in some kind of state responsiveness to interest rates or whether its other approaches  the staff is trying to think about these issuesthat is what mechanisms could we use to sell assets safely  it may be that there is no way to do it convincingly and the only way to shed assets is to do it through redemptions and that would be fine but i think we at least want to think through all of the options and assess whether there is some approach where we could basically get the effectsthe same kind of gradual winding down in the portfolio you would get under redemptionsbut that would give us more flexibility along the way 
mr bullard thank you 
chairman bernanke other questions  president lacker 
mr lacker i changed my mind  laughter  the day we announce that were going to sell assets theres no doubt that prices are going to change  so i dont think no price change should be the standard of safety right  we want to minimize the volatility of the path that prices take to where theyre going after the shift of our policy represented by the announcement of a path of asset sales  is that right  i mean youre using the word safely  im sort of inquiring about your meaning of the word safely here 
mr sack okay what i meant but you can correct me was not producing a large backup in rates i guess i was working under the assumption that an abrupt and sizable increase in longterm interest rates would be viewed as counterproductive at this point 
mr lacker but is it obvious that any backup in rates on mbs would be counterproductive theres some threshold we might want to achieverightbecause the data all suggest that were pushing them artificially low 
mr sack the data suggest weve pushed them low  we do think the lsaps have worked and it is just an optimal policy decision about how quickly you want to unwind any of those effects we can put this differently  a challenge with asset sales perhaps is that there will be a tendency for the markets to frontload all of the effects  when we did lsaps you saw an immediate and sizable market reaction then a lot of the program was carrying through the commitment to justify that reaction  i think policymakers need to be concerned about those same patterns taking place in reverse so thats the issue  is there a way to unwind the portfolio slowly to limit that immediate reaction 
chairman bernanke one would think that clarity about what youre going to dospeed or price or whateverwould help 
mr lacker yes absolutely 
chairman bernanke president rosengren 
mr rosengren just to follow up on that point it seems like you have a huge inventory and the market doesnt know how you are going to dispose of it  asking the street about what the interest rate reaction would beif at every meeting we might potentially dump a whole lot of it i would want a huge risk premium before i bought that asset  so as we think about asset sales and different rules for handling them it seems that if theres a clear rule it may have a different effect on the risk premium than the possibility that every six weeks you may or may not have a huge inventory dumped onto the market  we havent had an experience like this so i dont know how you can measure it empirically but to the extent that the dealer community has any feel for this it may be worth getting some sense about interest rates as well as quantities when you do your survey 
mr sack okay 
chairman bernanke president plosser 
mr plosser one quick question mr chairman  you may have alluded to this but are we going to take an action on whether or not we want to do the redemptions 
chairman bernanke my understanding was that tentatively for the moment we were just going to let things run off but we were just introducing this as an issue we need to be aware of 
mr sack correct i think that strategy is consistent with the current directive so i dont believe any action is necessary 
chairman bernanke okay vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley i just want to add that the issue on redemptions though is also colored by what you want the portfolio to look like in the longer run  lets say we start with a portfolio that was bills notes and bonds and was roughly in proportion to the market but its not clear that thats necessarily the portfolio that we want in the new world as we transition to a new monetary policy setting  that decision on redemptions is partly about balance sheet size and its also partly about where we want to take the portfolio over the medium to longer run 
chairman bernanke great okay  if there are no other questions let me turn to jim clouse and bill nelson for a brief report on some facilities  jim  
mr clouse following up on the plans discussed at the last meeting the desk carried out a series of smallscale realvalue reverse rp operations over the intermeeting period to identify any operational difficulties in moving cash and collateral between the federal reserve the clearing banks and the primary dealers  before conducting the operations the new york fed released a statement announcing that a series of such operations would be conducted and emphasizing that they had no implications for the stance of monetary policy  five such operations have been conducted with both treasury and agency debt securities serving as collateral  the maturities for these operations ranged from overnight to eight days including some with overlapping terms  the operations were quite smallthe maximum outstanding over the last two weeks was only about 400 millionand as anticipated had little or no market impact  all of the operations were conducted settled and matured successfully  a few minor technical issues surfaced and are being addressed  in short the tests confirmed that the system now has the capacity to conduct triparty reverse rp operations effectively with primary dealers using treasury and agency debt as collateral 
the staff continues to work on extending the reverse rp program to include agency mbs as collateral and to include a broader set of counterparties regarding the extension of collateral to include agency mbs the staff has been working with the two triparty clearing banks and the agency mbs custodian to determine the most efficient costeffective means of reversing out agency mbs collateral  significant complications must be addressed in this effort but the team expects to reach agreement on an overall approach in the near future and to give the clearing banks the goahead to make the necessary system changes within the next month  we expect that those changes will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of next year and that smallscale realvalue test reverse rp operations with agency mbs can begin shortly thereafter 
in terms of expanding the range of counterparties for reverse rp operations beyond the primary dealers the desk has identified a set of large cash providers and has begun discussions with some of these firms on a number of operational issues  in addition the staff is working to develop a set of public criteria that will allow a small number of large firms perhaps two dozen to present themselves as potential counterparties both of these efforts are proving quite challenging given the wide range of institutions involved the staff is pursuing this agenda aggressively but our best guess at this point is that the expansion of the range of counterparties will require several months for completion 
turning to other work on reserve management tools the staff has developed a proposal for a term deposit facility the basic elements of which were summarized in a memo distributed last week  as envisioned in the proposal term deposits would be a new type of account offered by the federal reserve to any institution that is eligible to earn interest on balances at a reserve bank  balances placed in term deposits would not be eligible to satisfy reserve or clearing balance requirements or to cover daylight or overnight overdrafts as a result balances placed in term deposits would drain reserves the proposal suggests that term deposits would be fixedrate obligations and could have maturities ranging between one and six months with no early withdrawal option as required by statute the rate paid on term deposits could not exceed the general level of shortterm interest rates  consistent with the federal reserves general policy of accepting as collateral any sound asset that a bank may hold the proposal suggests that term deposits could be pledged as collateral to secure borrowing at the discount window or daylight credit 
the staff proposal notes that term deposits could be offered to the public in several ways but focuses largely on the possibility of auctioning term deposits  auctions of term deposits would employ a singleprice format so that all winning bidders receive the highest rate among all winning bids at the auction  auctions would be conducted at regular intervals perhaps every two weeks and the settlement dates and maturities of the deposits could be aligned with the beginning of reserve maintenance periods  the proposal suggests that the board would select one reserve bank to act as the term deposit offering administrator for the system  the offering administrator would be responsible for tasks such as announcing term deposit auctions and posting auction results to a public website 
the staff proposal would seek public comment on three basic questions  the need for limitations on the amount of term deposits that any individual institution may hold or win at auction the appropriate range of maturities for term deposits and whether there are any alternative structures for term deposits that should be considered  after review by the board the staff proposal would be published in the federal register with a 30day public comment period based on the comments received a final proposal would be published early next year  as noted previously the automated systems necessary to implement a term deposit program have been developed and tested but a number of operational steps must be completed before the program can be implemented  the staff will be working aggressively to complete these steps over the next few months  bill will now continue the staff presentation 
mr nelson thank you jim  i will briefly update the committee on the modifications to the terms on the term auction facility and primary credit programs that the staff anticipates it will propose over the next several months 
the taf auction that was conducted yesterday was again substantially undersubscribed when it settles on thursday taf credit will equal 76 billion 45 percent lower than at the time of the november fomc meeting  all currently outstanding taf loans will come due coincident with the january taf auction  at that point only 28day taf credit will be provided  although only 75 billion will be auctioned in january it seems likely that it will again be undersubscribed because of the steep downward trend in taf credit and because the yearend will have passed 
in light of the continued improvement in interbank funding markets as discussed at the november fomc meeting the staff expects that it will soon recommend the board announce a schedule of taf auction amounts that decline to zero  the staff will propose a specific schedule after observing the results of the january 11 auction  if the auction is again substantially undersubscribed the staff could propose amounts that decline to zero in just a few months but evidence of stronger demand could lead us to recommend an auction schedule that declines a bit more slowly say to zero by midyear 
turning to primary credit primary credit declined 14 percent over the intermeeting period to 19 billion  of that amount 14 billion is outstanding to depfa and 4 billion to dexia which are both branches of european banks 
on november 17 the board announced that the maximum maturity on primary credit loans would be reduced to 28 days on january 14 a first step in normalizing the terms on primary credit  that change will align the maximum term on primary credit loans with the terms of taf loans  a next step in normalization could be a 25 basis point increase in the primary credit rate  the discount rate adjustment could be discussed by board members and reserve bank presidents at the january fomc meeting with any increase announced a few days later presumably accompanied by language that made it clear that the move was not a signal about the outlook for the stance of monetary policy  the staff envisions that presidents might initiate discussions with their boards of directors about a potential increase a week or so before the january fomc meeting 
a further step in normalization of primary credit terms could be a reduction in the maximum maturity to overnight except for the smallest institutions  the board and reserve banks could evaluate early next year the advisability and potential timing of such a move 
consideration about further increases in the primary creditfederal funds rate 
spread could be deferred until perhaps midyear to evaluate such further adjustments 
in light of accumulated experience with a 50 basis point spread and shorter terms  
that concludes our prepared remarks  we would be happy to answer your questions 

chairman bernanke are there questions for jim or bill  president lacker 
mr lacker yes could you elaborate on what discussions with our directors you envision in january 
mr nelson discussions about the increase in the discount rate  
chairman bernanke well need a recommendation 
mr lacker i see 
chairman bernanke its been a while 
mr madigan but our view is that this is obviously a sensitive topic so it might be better to hold off on that for several weeks 
mr hoenig rather than in this meeting 
mr madigan right no im sorry im talking about discussions with the boards of directors 
mr hoenig with the boards of directorsi understand 
chairman bernanke president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  i have a question on the term deposit facility one of the provisions is no early withdrawal but another provision is you can be pledged as collateral at the window those seem to be in conflict 
mr clouse both of them would give some potential for accessing liquidity  i personally wouldnt characterize it as being in conflict  it was a fine judgment on whether we should allow these to be pledged as collateral at the discount window but the federal reserve has a longstanding policy of taking basically any asset that a bank can hold as collateral  as long as the pricing for the primary credit program is correct as was pointed out at the last meeting actually there wouldnt be strong incentives for an institution to pledge collateral at the primary credit facility in order to invest it in a term deposit  we would ensure that that sort of arbitrage was ruled out and of course theres lots of stigma around borrowing at the discount window too so the option value of that is probably not that high 
i view it anyway as sort of a technical thing  banks already have over 1 trillion worth of collateral pledged at the discount window  they could do anything they need to at the primary credit window with any other form of collateral  so theres nothing really special about the term deposit facility allowing them to pledge those particular deposits as collateral  its just to be consistent with our existing policy 
mr bullard well you might turn that around and say then why have a no early withdrawal provision 
mr clouse well an early withdrawal option is first of all tremendously complicated to develop in the automated system  the automated system has been developed and to put in that feature would really greatly complicate things  in addition you have to worry a lot about where you set the penalty to guard against very frequent usage of that option  so if you wanted to provide some capability for these institutions to access liquidity it just seemed a lot more natural to keep access to liquidity in a facility where we understand exactly how things work and as you know we dont anticipate especially as we move to normalize the program that institutions will be regularly using the primary credit facility  but i would say too that it will be interesting to review comments on this from the public  
mr bullard is this the comment period for the committee 
chairman bernanke go ahead  we dont have this unstructured period so consider this to be your time to comment  
mr bullard okay one of the aspects of the tdf is well now were going to drain reserves how meaningful is it to say that ive got an overnight deposit at the central bank versus ive got a 30day deposit at the central bank one of which im going to count as reserves and in the monetary base and the other of which im not going to count in that it seems to me the macroeconomic difference is very slight 
chairman bernanke well you cant lend the 30day money in the overnight federal funds market 
mr bullard theres a question about how liquid it really is but it seems that its very substitutable i can wait 30 days and take it out 
mr lacker mr chairman 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker is it useful to consider alongside that question president bullard the question of how a term deposit compares in liquidity with an equal term treasury holding which is equally collateralizable and thus equally liquid but we consider a nonmonetary asset 
mr madigan indeed the tdfs would be less liquid because they cant be sold 
mr lacker right theyre nontransferable  there you go its even less liquid than tbills 
mr bullard theres variable liquidity among various assets and you should have metrics about the degree of liquidity and then get your measure of how much liquidity is out there instead of arbitrarily saying certain assets are liquid and others are not 
chairman bernanke for the reasons that you just described i think it will be helpful in managing overnight interest rates  of course theres always the question about the linkages between that and broad financial conditions but our typical target is the overnight rate 
mr bullard do we expect the interest rates in this facility to be anything other than the expected interest rate on reserves over the six months  plus a term premium 
mr clouse the staff proposal envisions largely an auction facility to offer these deposits and you might expect then that the auction rate would stop out somewhat below a comparable term money market instrument for example maybe a little bit below libor reflecting the fact that were a riskfree counterparty rather than a risky counterparty 
chairman bernanke other questions  president rosengren 
mr rosengren just a question on the primary credit rate  we all have directors meetings at different times  so if its purely a technical adjustment it might be better to have a day that we all called our boards of directors at the same time  im just a little worried that somebody might have a directors meeting in the first week of january and though i know this is supposed to stay confidential it might start leaking out  so it just strikes me that it would be better if we could just say on a certain day you will call your board and everybody talks about it as being a technical adjustment if thats truly what we think it is 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker yes i was just going to suggest that  i think the record is that rate change requests from reserve banks have not leakedi dont know of any example of rate requests that have leaked i do think a little more formal coordination might be useful in that going into our january meetings wed know that were getting the wink that the board is likely to approve this technical adjustment 
chairman bernanke well coordinate  and we dont need recommendations from all the banks of course but just one  we understand the need to coordinate this in a way that is not going to create problems  thank you president pianalto 
ms pianalto it might also be a good time to remind directors  there was one occasion when it was leaked and it was a federal crime  so it might be an appropriate time to remind directors as we do all the time that any discussion of the discount rate is confidential and if there is a leak its a federal offense 
chairman bernanke well put  president plosser 
mr plosser id like to follow up a little bit on the tdf because im still uncomfortable with the potential for arbitrage between it and primary credit  jim do you envision that the taf will shut down before tdf becomes active 
mr clouse that seems likely given the markets expectations 
mr plosser otherwise i can imagine a bank lending to us at one rate and getting the taf credit at 25 basis points which is borrowing backed by posting tdf collateral  it looks as if youre going to cap the auction rate at the primary credit rate 
mr clouse well wed want to be sure that it couldnt go higher than the primary credit rate for sure 
mr plosser because otherwise you are inviting them to game the system  but if the term premium is not high enough then that sort of enters into what maturities youre going to offer whether the term premium for six months or a year would be so large that you couldnt cap the tdf rate at the primary credit ratethat is the spread wasnt big enough  so im just really puzzled about how all of this is going to sort itself out and whether or not this is really going to be effective at draining any reserves at all 
chairman bernanke theres always some primary credit rate spread thats big enough that you can slip anything you want to underneath it 
mr plosser right but that spread will partly depend on what the range of maturities are that we offer at the tdf  the longer the maturity presumably the higher the premium and whether weve got the spread high enough to cover that would be something that we would have to sort of work on i would think in order to make it work 
will that end up raising interest rates  president kocherlakota was talking about this do these tools affect interest rates in some sense is this just a backhanded way of raising rates which we might as well raise anyway  im still a little uncomfortable with how this is actually going to work and whether its going to do what we think its going to do 
chairman bernanke this is great monetary economics  laughter you can have such a great graduate class 
mr plosser yes right if i live that long  laughter 
chairman bernanke other questions  president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota yes im going to follow up on some of the things president plosser was saying what we could do is raise the interest rate on excess reserves we could offer this term deposit which strikes me as like offering a certificate of deposit a cd to a bank and they can lock in their fundsthats offering a high interest rate on a particular kind of illiquid asset or we could sell off mbs but were worried about raising the rates there  so i guess were going to defer all of this until january and well sort it all out at that point  but there is this question about which interest rate were going to be manipulating at a given point in time  im not seeing clearly why this is the right interest rate to manipulate as opposed to the ioer rate or just selling agency mbs  thats the part im not following  but again maybe this will be cleared up in january 
chairman bernanke i dont want to interject but i think there are two ways to look at it one is just to say the ioer rate which is an overnight rate is the basic tool and we just have all of these finetuning instruments to make sure we dont have too much slippage between the market ratethe federal funds rateand the ioer rate  thats one approach and i think thats the simplest approach  the other way though is to say well we really have tools that can affect things at different parts of the term structure or different types of instruments and we can play with that if we want that gets more complicated and it makes policymaking more complicated  so i dont know how far we want to go in that direction but i think there are at least two ways to look at that 
mr kocherlakota just to follow upif im a bank why would i put my reserves into this account unless it paid a higher interest rate than the ioer rate  because its less liquid 
chairman bernanke it will 
mr kocherlakota okay so at least as far as i can see its not just finetuning that gap between the fed funds rate and the ioer rate  its actually playing with the various aspects of the term structure in some fashion  and maybe thats the right way for us to proceed 
chairman bernanke market operations are swaps of assets for assets  were swapping reserves for deposits president evans 
mr evans something about president plossers question made me think about stigma  jim you mentioned this too  if you were a bank and you had these term deposits and then something happened and you went to the windowwhich is just a normal type of thing would you be worried in the old days if we were worried about arbitrage then the supervisor would make a phone call  it seems that we would have to be very clear in mentioning that it would still be okay to access the window under the right conditions and that you wouldnt get a call from the supervisor  or if theyre worried about that then they might just not bid on the term deposits and it doesnt amount to anything  it might be a little tricky 
chairman bernanke yes we left that old regime of course when we moved the discount rate above the funds rate 
mr evans right thats why its okay of course they still dont borrow  at some point jim mentioned that stigma is our friendi wrote that downor at least that it could help us with something but we think that stigma will make this arbitrage go away  its just something to think about 
chairman bernanke any other questions no response  i could press on just a bit more  our friend dave stockton is a victim of h1n1 flu virus  david wilcox has stepped into the breach so let me turn it over to david 
mr wilcox  thank you mr chairman  i will be delivering remarks this 
morning that were for the most part prepared by dave stockton who cant be with 
us today as the chairman mentioned because of illness  i should note that such 
circumstances may have little historical precedent  my colleagues and i have now

 original source material and found no instance in which robin had to clean up

id like to do three things this afternoon first we have received an unusually large slug of data since the close of the greenbook so i will provide a brief update on the nearterm forecast second id like to summarize our take on where we are in the recovery process at present and finally i will point out what we see as the major sources of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook 
since we published the forecast last wednesday we have received readings on retail sales merchandise trade inventories consumer sentiment industrial production and producer prices the retail sales data for november were right in line with our projection as you know we had been rather skeptical earlier in the fall when the consumer spending data began to show improvement  we thought declining employment weak incomes sour sentiment and still tight financial conditions should be exerting greater restraint on spending than implied by the incoming data  however some of that tension was reduced by the sizable upward revisions that the bea made to its estimates of labor income in the second and third quarters those revisions suggest that the recovery in consumer spending is on a firmer footing  last fridays reading on consumer sentiment from the reutersmichigan survey showed a further modest improvement that also is consistent with the pickup in spending that we have witnessed of late  all told we now estimate that real pce increased at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second half no different from our forecast of last wednesday but about  percentage point faster than our october forecast 
we also received data on retail inventories late last week  retail inventories outside the motor vehicle sector ran off at a slower pace in october than we had expected adding a couple of tenths to our forecast of growth in real gdp in the current quarter and the somewhat strongerthanexpected figures for exports in october reported in last weeks release on merchandise trade also added a couple of tenths to current quarter growth  nathan will have a bit more to say about that in a few moments  taken together the inventory and trade data would lead us to revise up estimated growth in real gdp in the current quarter to an annual rate of about 4 percent 
earlier today we published our first estimate of industrial production in november  total ip increased an estimated 08 percent last month while manufacturing output rose 11 percent  we pride ourselves on cultivating a high degree of collegiality in the division of research and statistics so it comes as no surprise to find out that we had built a pretty good forecast of these results into last weeks greenbook laughter all told and notwithstanding the downbeat tone to the december empire state manufacturing survey that was released this morning the industrial sector remains on track for a second consecutive quarter of 6 percent rate of growth thus beginning the process of digging out from some very steep earlier declines 
this brings me to the second issue that i wanted to touch on this afternoon which is given all that we have seen in the past six weeks where do we think we are in the cyclical process  these could well prove to be famous last words but i believe that the accumulating evidence supports the view that a moderate recovery is under way and indeed that the recovery is gaining greater traction  not only have we seen an acceleration in aggregate output but the composition of that acceleration seems favorable for activity going forward importantly domestic final sales are firming  the key elements of that firming include a recovery in housing the aforementioned turnaround in consumer spending and a stabilization in spending on capital goods  moreover exports are getting a boost from the improvement in global activity  and with the overall prospects for sales looking brighter businesses appear to be lifting production further in order to slow the runoff of inventories 
finally we are now seeing more encouragingalbeit still tentativesigns that the deterioration in the labor market is abating  declines in private payrolls averaged 90000 per month over the past three months  that compares with job losses that were averaging about 700000 per month earlier this year and were still running at about 425000 per month at midyear  other indicators that labor market conditions are beginning to turn include an upswing in temporary help employment in recent months and a jump in the workweek in november  and since the november survey week initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to drift down 
while the probability that we have entered a selfsustaining recovery appears to have increased appreciably considerable risks continue to attend our forecast  one risk that has been highlighted by the recent data is that of a sharper acceleration of activity driven in part by a more rapid attempt by businesses to halt a further runoff of inventories and perhaps even add to stocks  the book value inventory data that we have for october show a small accumulation of stocks in the manufacturing and trade sectors after a long period of huge liquidations and a sharp rebound in activity caused by a swing in the inventory cycle has been a feature of some previous more vshaped recoveries in our forecast we have assumed that the positive figure for october overstates the underlying upswing and we have penciled in further moderate declines in inventories for the remainder of the quarter  we have done so because we just havent seen or heard much that would indicate that a substantially greater snapback in inventory investment is providing a major lift to production  the national and regional purchasing managers reports point to ongoing increases in factory output but moderate onesnot a sudden or sharp pop in activity  and my reading is that the reports given in the beige book do not seem consistent with an inventoryled surge of major proportions in production 
but if we are misreading the situation and the liquidation of inventories is coming to an end more abruptly than we are projecting then the growth of real gdp could easily outstrip our 4 percent estimate in the current quarter and if past patterns were to prevail we could see several quarters of outsized increases in real gdp  in the first instance a faster turnaround in inventory investment would pull forward some of the growth that we have projected to be stretched out over the next couple of years  but greater nearterm strength could beget stronger household and business confidence and spending as well as a faster relaxation of the terms on which credit is being offered to households and nonfinancial businesses all of which could amplify the effects on the growth of real gdp the path of resource utilization and price inflation we will be monitoring these cyclical forces carefully in the period immediately ahead 
despite the generally more favorable tenor of the incoming data of late there remain considerable downside risks to the greenbook projection as well  one prominent risk is that final sales peter out next year rather than accelerating further as we are forecasting after declining at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first half final sales appear to be increasing at about a 2 percent pace in the second half and we are projecting a 3 percent advance in 2010  much of next years acceleration occurs in spending for durable goods especially business investment  in our view improving cash flows an ample stock of liquid assets increasing confidence in the durability of the recovery the release of some pentup demand and a further easing of financial strains should provide noticeable impetus to investment spending  but it is possible that we are too optimistic in our expectation of further easing of financial conditions including the terms of lending from the banking sector or we could be attributing too much staying power to the stimulus being provided by fiscal policy 
a second risk relates to the labor market  as i noted earlier we have been encouraged by the recent data  but it is important to note that to date the smaller employment declines have principally been driven by a reduction in layoffs  as yet we have seen few signs of a widespread pickup in hiring in readings from the jolts data the nfib survey of small businesses or measures of helpwanted or job availability we expect to see increasing signs of hiring in the months ahead as businesses grow more confident of the recovery  but anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain very cautious  if that caution persists longer than we expect hiring could remain weak and slack in labor markets could fail to recede to the extent we are projecting 
we made only very minor adjustments to our inflation projection this round  the incoming data on overall pce prices were a bit above our projection  but the surprises were almost completely the result of a somewhat faster pass through of crude oil and natural gas prices to the retail level and higher than expected nonmarket prices which we think have little signal content for underlying inflation  as a consequence although we have revised up the projected increase in total pce prices in the current quarter by  percentage point to 2 percent we have revised down the projected increase in the first quarter by nearly the same amount to about 1 percent the increase in energy prices that was reported in this mornings ppi release surprised us to the upside but in the past producer prices for energy have been a pretty noisy indicator of developments at the retail level so we are withholding judgment pending tomorrows cpi release  unlike ppi energy prices the ppi for medical care does feed directly into the pce price index and these prices were a little lower than we had expected shaving perhaps a tenth or two off our projection for core pce inflation in the fourth quarter 
looking beyond the near term we revised up our forecast for core pce prices by a tenth in both 2010 and 2011 to reflect somewhat higher projected import prices and a slightly smaller margin of slack  reflecting these revisions as well as some change in the profile of energy prices we lowered projected overall pce inflation by a tenth in 2010 to 13 percent and raised the projection by two tenths in 2011 to 12 percent  nathan will continue our presentation 
mr sheets the foreign economic recovery has continued to broaden and deepen we now judge that real gdp abroad expanded at a 4 percent rate in the third quarter the emerging market economies emes continued to lead the rebound with growth strengthening in the third quarter to a 9 percent pace  notably the mexican economy bounced back vigorously as it shook off the restraining effects of the h1n1 virus and as automotive production there resumed  thirdquarter growth in emerging asia stepped down from the 15 percent surge in the previous quarter but remained near 10 percent as activity in the region continued to benefit from policy stimulus and the rebound in global trade   in the advanced foreign economies real gdp growth turned slightly positive on average in the third quarter after five consecutive quarters of contraction  but the bad news is that final domestic demand remained quite sluggish in many of these economies including the euro area the united kingdom and japan 
fourth quarter data suggest that growth in the emes is moderating to a more sustainable 5 percent pace which we believe is likely to continue through the forecast period we note that the vigor of the recovery in emerging asia has kicked off rebounds in asset prices in the region and led to concerns that bubbles may be forming  while the citystates of hong kong and singapore have seen marked increases in real estate prices property prices in other asian economies are flat or up only moderately and forwardlooking priceearnings ratios for equities are within historical ranges of course we will continue to monitor this issue closely going forward 
for the advanced economies we forecast that growth will strengthen from just under 1 percent in the third quarter to over 3 percent by 2011  we expect that private spending in these economies will eventually pick up boosted by normalizing financial and credit conditions improving economic sentiment and the ongoing recovery in the united states the possibility that private spending in the advanced economies might rebound more slowly than we now envision is an important downside risk to our outlook both for these economies and for exportdependent emerging markets 
this month marks the 20th anniversary of the peak of the japanese equity bubble and policymakers there continue to struggle to find a formula that will allow the economy to shake off its sustained malaise japan was hit hard by the collapse in global trade during the crisis but the country is now recording a strong rebound in its exports to emerging asia and its banks did not have the same exposure to toxic financial assets that has plagued many other advancedeconomy banking systems  nevertheless the prospects for japanese recovery remain quite uncertain  after an encouraging second quarter rebound japanese gdp growth slowed to a meager 1 percent pace in the third quarter  private demand continues to be soft held back by weaknesses in labor and housing markets  the recent strengthening of the yen is another source of restraint and headline consumer price deflation intensified to a record 2 percent in october 
apart from our concerns about the apparent intensification of japanese deflation we expect that foreign inflation will remain well behaved through the forecast period averaging around 2 percent per year this projection is shaped by ongoing evidence that inflation expectations abroad are generally well anchored and by our view that economic slack will remain sizable in many countries even at the end of the forecast period in addition in line with quotes from futures markets our forecast calls for commodity prices to be relatively well contained going forward  since your last meeting the spot price of wti west texas intermediate oil has fallen 10 per barrel to about 70 a portion of this decrease was unique to wti but last week the prices of other grades of oil posted notable declines as well 
we continue to watch for signs as to when the foreign authorities will withdraw policy stimulus  on the fiscal front new governments in germany and japan announced measures that should give some small additional support to their recoveries and that signal a continuing commitment to stimulative policies  however the potential constraints on fiscal policy were underscored by the credit rating agencies recent moves to downgrade greek sovereign debt and to place spain and portugal on negative watch in response to concerns about the sustainability of their respective fiscal positions sp standard  poors yesterday joined fitch in downgrading mexicos credit rating to bbb citing the countrys diminishing oil production failure to expand its narrow nonoil tax base and diminished prospects for fiscal reforms during the second half of president calderns term 
as for monetary policy the bank of england increased its assetpurchase facility by 25 billion and the bank of japan introduced a threemonth lending facility  although the european central bank announced plans to begin winding up its exceptional liquidity support facilities markets seem to have pushed back a bit the expected start of monetary policy tightening by the ecb and other major central banks our forecast calls for the bank of canada to begin tightening policy in the second half of next year and for the ecb and boe to follow suit in early 2011  we anticipate that the boj will keep its policy rate at 10 basis points through the end of the forecast period 
the foreign exchange value of the dollar fell through the month of november but has since rebounded vigorously on strongerthanexpected us data  on net the dollar is little changed since the last fomc meeting  the dollars moves against the yen were particularly marked as it traded briefly in late november as low as 85 against the yen prompting market chatter that the japanese authorities would intervene to forestall further appreciation of their currency  the dollar subsequently rallied closing above 89 against the yen down less than 2 percent over the intermeeting period  the dollar also declined against the korean won and the mexican peso but moved up against the euro the swiss franc and the brazilian real 
relative to its peak in early march this year the nominal broad dollar index is down 
12 percent but it still remains roughly 7 percent above its 2008 trough  our forecast 
maintains the working assumption that the real broad dollar index will depreciate at
 roughly a 2 percent pace on average over the next two years 

last week after the greenbook went to bed we received the october trade data  
exports showed greaterthanexpected strength the gains were broadbased but 
particularly large for capital and consumer goods  in response we have marked up 
our projection for fourth quarter export growth by nearly 4 percentage points to a 
robust 16 percent clip imports also surprised on the upside albeit to a lesser extent  
the upshot is that net exports are likely to add  percentage point more to gdp 
growth in the fourth quarter than we anticipated in the greenbook bringing their 
contribution to  percentage point 

going forward export growth should proceed at about a 9 percent pace through the next two years stimulated by declines in the dollar and the ongoing rebound in foreign activity  import growth is likely to be a bit slower in the ballpark of 7 percent supported by the us recovery but restrained by headwinds from the dollar  because imports grow from a higher base however the contribution of net exports to us gdp growth is expected to be roughly neutral over the forecast period   thank you  that concludes our prepared remarks  were happy to take your questions 
chairman bernanke thanks are there questions for our colleagues no response seeing no questions 
mr plosser its hard to know how to take that restrained enthusiasm in this report   
chairman bernanke coffee awaits laughter  one small item  we need to approve the domestic operations 
mr kohn so moved 
mr warsh  second 
chairman bernanke without objection  all right why dont we take a coffee break and come back in about 20 minutes thank you 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke okay why dont we recommence and begin our goround   president rosengren  
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  we have had some heartening news since the last meeting  in particular the employment report was stronger than most analysts expected with the economy losing only 11000 jobs  however it is obvious but still important to emphasize that this is still moving in the wrong direction  as the recovery progresses a good employment report will be one that adds jobs substantially faster than growth in the labor force so we can make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate and reattaining full employment 
the greenbook has the unemployment rate at 96 percent at the end of 2010 with an assumption of no change in the federal funds rate  unfortunately my own forecast is quite similar  initial claims for unemployment insurance remain quite elevated  we need to see a significant reduction in job loss and a marked increase in hiring if we are going to achieve net increases in employment that significantly exceed growth in the labor force  other labor market trends highlight why the progress is likely to be slow in bringing the unemployment rate down  first the fraction of employed persons working parttime for economic reasons is nearly at an alltime high for the series  second the workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers remains low relative to nonrecessionary periods  with many workers on a reduced workweek or involuntarily on parttime work many businesses will defer hiring new employees until their existing workforce is more fully utilized  thus even if gdp growth exceeds potential as i expect it will over the coming quarters this will likely reduce the unemployment rate only gradually 
headwinds from the banking sector are also likely to continue to blow strongly  the percent of bank assets in institutions with low supervisory ratings continues to grow and bank failures are artificially being held down by resource constraints at the fdic  given the volume of problem loans and problem banks it is probably time to have a resolution trust corporation to deal with failed bank assets recovery in commercial real estate will be delayed if the public and private sectors hold large inventories of problem commercial real estate loans in the hope that losses will be avoided through forbearance 
on the inflation front there is little evidence of inflationary pressures  a variety of models used by the boston fed expect continued disinflation  for models that depend on resource slack the very high unemployment rate relative to any reasonable estimate of full employment suggests further disinflation  however recognizing the difficulties in measuring unemployment and output gaps we have also examined models that emphasize the role of real marginal cost  here too one would expect significant disinflation because real unit labor costs have been falling dramatically and are currently at a postwar low  with doubledigit unemployment i dont expect a quick reversal in real unit labor costs  furthermore our model suggests that even in the presence of extremely wellanchored inflation expectations the downward pull from resource underutilization may well outweigh the stabilizing effect of anchored expectations 
thus while the highfrequency data have clearly improved from earlier this year they have not changed enough to significantly alter the outlook of an economy with very weak labor markets and a significant risk of further disinflation  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  the eighth district business conditions are showing modest improvement according to many business contacts  however business leaders remain very cautious about the outlook for the economy  this is affecting business behavior with respect to capital expenditure plans for 2010 and it is also having a big effect on hiring plans the cautious mood is typically attributed to three factors  one is weak demand for final products although that aspect is improving modestly  the second is uncertainty over the scope and nature of national policy changes as often cited by business contacts  one contact said in a meeting tell me what the rules are tell me what the tax rates arei will proceed with business planning then and only then the third factor is a residual pessimism concerning the direction of the economy over the next two years worries that the economy simply will not recover as it has in the pastthe idea is that something fundamental has changed in the economy and may not be in the process of repair 
energy firms in the eighth district report weak conditions in the us  low energy usage and high levels of inventory accumulation are leading to continued cuts in hours in employment in that sector in asia in contrast the energy sector is very robust as we heard earlier in our report on the international conditions 
large transportation firms in the district report increasing volumes for the first time in a long time as well as increasing revenues  these firms have been surprised on the upside regarding christmas activity  theyve had to scramble to meet transportation demands especially from asia in recent weeks 
banking conditions are generally weak in the eighth district as im sure they are across the country commercial real estate remains a huge concern  bankers generally felt that the fdic does not have the resources or a plan to close banks as rapidly as necessary in the current environment  many contacts are worried in addition about a looming crisis in statelevel financing i have heard earfuls about that problem 
on the national outlook it looks as if we remain on track for a strengthening economy in 2010 i was encouraged by the strength of the november employment report  despite the drop in jobs it was much less than expected  i think its reasonable to expect positive payrolls in the first months of 2010  positive gdp growth in the third quarter and apparently now in the fourth quarter suggests the recession has ended in terms of ruleofthumb metrics  but i want to remind the committee because employment is only now turning the corner the actual recession end date may be closer to the end of 2009 as opposed to mid2009  this issue has an arbitrary flavor to it but it does affect popular perceptions of the state of the economy as well as both consumer and business expectations 
financial market stress continues to abate  its important to remember that some stress does remain  if we were comparing january 2007 a precrisis date to today without the intervening period we would be amazed at how much financial market stress was out there  we would be saying that financial market stress is well above normal compared to that benchmark  its only because that stress was so high last fall that it seems relatively less painful today  still im encouraged by the improvements that weve seen and i expect further improvement in the first half of 2010 in financial markets 
i think an important question for the committee and for the outlook is  could financial market turmoil somehow reemerge  weve seen a little bit of trepidation in the intermeeting period with events in the middle east i think it could reemerge although the levels of government guarantees worldwide that were implemented during 2008 and 2009 suggest that markets are unlikely to panic as they did in 2008  but i dont think that risk is completely down to zero 
on the inflation side i think inflation risks remain confined to the mediumterm anywhere from two to five years from now  actions we take today and through 2010 will shape those risks i would stress again that current policy is completely unprecedented in the postwar us period uncertainty is high both around this table and in financial markets on what the effects of our policies will be econometric analysis using data from the last 25 years is unlikely to provide a completely reliable guide to possible outcomes in this situation 
on balance sheet issues as i have said before i still prefer that the committee take a more active stance on managing the balance sheet going forward  i thought the memo from the desk and brian sacks discussion today on runoff issues for the balance sheet made it clear that there is nothing optimal about pursuing any of the passive strategies  these are just possible strategies that we could pursue but an optimal strategy would somehow talk about how we were going to react to the incoming information on the economy during the period of zero interest rates which according to the greenbook will still be most ofor all ofthe next two years 
the idea of taking a completely passive approach to balance sheet issues is very much counter to all that we have learned about optimal monetary policy over the last 25 years  the assetpurchase program at least according to the analysis by staff is thought to have an important real effect on the economy  so my question is  why ignore these effects when developing plans to get the balance sheet back to normal size over some time horizon if the economy performs better than expected we may want to normalize the balance sheet sooner than 2016 or later as would happen under a passive policy  if the economy performs worse than expectedsuppose we are back in recession next fallit seems clear that we would want to expand purchases further 
and let me reiterate the amount of uncertainty that is inherent in any forecast  if you just look at the staff estimates of uncertainty for instance 6 percent real gdp growth in 2011 is actually within the greenbooks 70 percent confidence interval  so thats one possible outcome and it is not an outlandish outcome  when you get nine months a year 18 months down the line the economy may look very different from what it looks like today  and we have to have policies in place to be ready for those types of possible outcomes 
announcing the end of the assetpurchase program in the first quarter of 2010 is not as transparent as i would like because it suggests that we would not take further actions when in fact we would in certain states of the world as long as interest rates remain near zero  so it would also be helpful to be able to make smaller adjustments meeting by meeting as information arrives on the state of the economy as we would with our interest rate instrument 
finally if we can we would like to move the unsavory assets that have caused us some trouble off the balance sheet faster than current projections envision but in a way that would still support recovery we could do that in one of two ways  we could replace them with treasuries which was discussed a little bit earlier or we could just sell them outright as appropriate but in a way that would not upset financial markets and cause a backup in rates  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  economic activity in the third district has remained slow but there has been some improvement in a number of sectors including manufacturing retail sales and residential real estate  the outlook by our firms continues to be for low levels of activity but most of our contacts say they believe that conditions have bottomed out and will improve but they remain very cautious about the future 
let me start with some very good news which seems appropriate in this holiday season  our manufacturing surveys general activity index in november rose for the fourth consecutive month up to 167 from 115 in october  our december survey which will be released and therefore is embargoed until thursday at 1000 am also shows an increase up to 204  another positive note was delivered on the employment index of our survey which moved from negative territory where it had been for many many many many many months into positive territory for the first time at 63  both of those numbers seem consistent with a steady improvement in the general activity index and the growth and positive number for employment were particularly encouraging 
retail sales in the district improved slightly in november for most of our stores and most lines of merchandise including autos which had dropped off at the end of the cashforclunkers program  the retailers we spoke to are cautious about holiday sales  they are keeping inventories leaner and moving to lowerquality items and therefore lowerpriced merchandise which is going to make it a bit more difficult i think to interpret the retail sales numbers going forward 
employment in the three states continues to decline but the rate of decline has slowed considerably consistent with that in the nation  we dont have the november employment numbers yet but so far for the last 12 months the pace of job losses in each of our states has been less than that in the nation and the tristate unemployment rate is only 92 percent in october a full percentage point below the national rate  well seecan i use word gap if this gap is maintained when the november numbers come out next friday 
the commercial real estate market remains weakno surprise there  our contacts expect construction and leasing to remain at low levels well into next year  this matters for many banks in our district because they have exposure to and are responding to and not lending to developers indeed bank lending continues to contract across all categoriesconsumers businesses and real estate bankers report that the declines though reflect both supply and demand factors  they have tightened credit standards although most seem to suggest that they are not continuing to tighten credit standards that is the bankers we spoke to seem to be comfortable where they are for now lending is down but it seems to be as much a lack of demand as a lack of credit supply especially to businesses  most banks reported continuing deterioration in credit quality across all loan categories but some said the rise in delinquencies and defaults appeared to be slowing  i would note that in the nfib survey that came out about a week ago small businesses ranked the lack of demand for their goods as a much bigger problem than the lack of credit as demand rises more generally in the economy the credit quality of these firms is likely to improve and they will increase demand for loans and lending will be forthcoming as their credit quality improves  that will be a natural part of the cyclical response of a recovering economy 
at the national level my reading of the data is that the improvement in economic and financial market conditions appears to be gaining momentum and the likelihood that recovery will be sustainable has increased  indeed i think conditions in financial markets have improved more quickly than many of us had predicted  weve been lucky that some of the downside risks we saw a year agoincluding the possibility of steeperthanexpected house price declines and no improvement in equity pricesdidnt happen while some of the upside risks including fasterthanexpected growth abroad and a more rapid decline in the dollar did in fact occur  so sometimes we have to take the good news when it comes and it may be smarter to be lucky than its lucky to be smart sometimes 
employment retail sales housing and manufacturing activity continue to improve  the november employment report was quite encouraging in this regard and doesnt appear to have been driven by seasonals or even one particular sector  the pace of job losses has slowed pretty significantly over the past few months and initial claims for unemployment insurance including both the state and federal programs have moved down  households seem to have made significant progress in getting their balance sheets more in order and consumer spending has picked up more than expected  caution low sentiment in addition to tight credit may be holding back some of the spending but that could easily change if improvements in labor markets continue  in the greenbook consumption is forecast to grow less than real income but given the low level of consumption this would actually seem to be an upside risk in the forecast 
private sector forecasters have been revising up their forecasts based on recent data  i think it would be prudent for us to recognize that the recovery may be more robust than we had been expecting and that the equilibrium real rates of interest may rise faster than anticipated  if so we will need to be ready to begin reducing the degree of monetary policy accommodation sooner than later which means we may want to begin signaling this in our statement  as real rates rise the opportunity cost of banks holding on to vast excess reserves may lead to a rapid increase in the money multiplier and a conversion of excess reserves into loans or borrowed money this may happen very quickly and require a rapid response on our part and we should anticipate this with the language in our statements so that we dont get caught off guard  thus i see a greater upside risk in the medium termthe two to fiveyear termto inflation than the greenbook does inflation expectations for now remain stable  im encouraged by that  but again oil and commodity prices have begun to rise again who knows their effect on expectations going forward  we must be cautious in our interpretation of those events  similarly the fall in the dollar while positive for growth may be signaling increased inflation expectations  all this reinforces my view that we are likely going to have to begin withdrawing some of this extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that we have put into place sooner than anticipated in the greenbook baseline forecast 
and we will need to begin communicating this possibility to the public  otherwise we may find ourselves behind the curve and unable to raise rates in as timely a fashion as we may desire because our language will have constrained us  as growth rates rise we are going to have to allow interest rates to increase and not take those increases as signals of market dysfunction that need policy intervention  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  the sentiment of directors and contacts in the sixth district supports a modest recovery scenario  in the most recent cycle of board meetings surveys and calls i heard views that suggest an improving but still quite fragile economic reality  we collected a number of comments that represent color and not much that raised doubts about the modestly better conditions  we heard reports of better retail spending for appliances and building materials  this was confirmed by last fridays retail sales estimate  retail sales improvement however seems to be tied to deep price discounts and we heard retailers are not building inventories in anticipation of a sustained spending pickup  we heard that retailers are prepared to lose sales for lack of instore inventory 
we also heard reports that temporary hiring has increased and that too was reflected in the most recent employment report for november  temp agencies told us that they are seeing growth in higherlevel administrative jobs  anecdotal feedback also supported the story that president bullard pointed outthat policy uncertainty about health care taxes regulation and cap and trade is feeding a very cautious approach to business investment and hiring 
the atlanta banks economic growth and recovery forecast continues to foresee a path to the downside of the greenbook outlook particularly in 2011 and 2012  notwithstanding some betterthanexpected incoming data i am holding to the view that there are formidable and very likely persistent suppressing factors that will inhibit a buildup of growth momentum  our greatest concerns are centered on business investment and the impact of commercial real estate value contraction on bank credit to smaller businesses which ultimately affects job growth 
we looked more deeply at the inventory and the commercial real estaterelated concerns during the intermeeting period and did not find reason to adjust our forecast assumptions  we found that while inventories are lean in a few retail categories significant excess inventory remains in many manufacturing categories we also found that there is a strong coincidence of banks with commercial real estate exposure in excess of three times capital and small business loan share an implication of the atlanta banks outlook is very slow progress on unemployment and underemployment 
as regards price stability i remain of the view that upside inflation risk is not much of a concern for the near and medium term  i find it hard to pinpoint a source of broad inflationary pressure and see some indications of disinflation  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president fisher 
mr fisher thank you mr chairman  as pointed out by first officer murdoch and his shipmate nathan sheets laughter we have seen some rather startling economic data recentlya less negative unemployment report just to take president rosengrens interpretation and some indications of improved consumer dynamics and a much improved international economic growth scene  financial markets i think are robust  key spreads have continued to narrow weve had some major announcements regarding tarp repayments and some significant nonfinancial transactions involving firms mainly in my district for example buffetts acquisition of burlington northern and exxons deal with txo announced yesterday  these developments are encouraging  they indicate to me the recovery is under way 
but im still in a trust but verify mode mainly based on the anecdotal evidence that im picking up which is mixed from my contacts  im beginning to detect a faint demandpull heartbeat among bulk shippersair freight operators like ups and federal express and the rails  longdistance telephone usage is up slightly year over year  thats always an interesting sign in this case driven by call center activity and yet the retailers report sequential slippage month over month and year over year for december thus far with walmart and penneys especially concerned about the bottom three income quartiles for christmas and for the first half of the year 
pricing power as i think dennis just referred to eludes producers in most sectors  retailers who look back at their black friday activity and activity since then report ultrapricesensitive consumption although i would note that the two large express shippers have announced increases in prices coming on january 4  the announced number is 4 percentif you look at the way thats practiced it will probably be a net rate of 2 percent  and there are reports that walmart and other large merchants are using a little bit of pricing power in order to protect their margins 
one worrisome development that i have heard about is in retail supply  chinese suppliers to retailers are attempting to renegotiate the price concessions for soft goods for 2010  most of the merchants report that they have rebuffed them but they do not believe they can continue to hold off doing so into the second half of 2010 and 2011 as chinese manufacturers margins are being squeezed by increasing labor costs raw material costs and inflation  and the expectations are for a reversal in sign from a minus 3 to 4 percent for soft goods to plus 3 to 5 percent as we proceed through the second half of 2010 assuming that consumption holds up 
on the balance sheet front i could detect no change in this goround with my interlocutors  the capital markets are pretty much wide open to the big boys who are still hoarding cash most with the exception of energy companies such as exxon which are focused on longerterm natural gasa play that they consider defensiveare sitting on large cash reserves few are expecting to expand their capex domestically until both the political and economic skies are clear 
as to the small guys they continue to complain about the paucity of bank credit  as to budgeting head count and other operating overhead for 2010 the new ubiquitous buzzwords are zog and nog the bias is towards zog which is zero overhead growth or nog which is negative overhead growth  this will not likely change until they see the whites of the eyes of topline growth in their revenues it remains elusive  those who do see it are pursuing what is known in the parlance of consulting as the hog approach which is budgeting their overhead to half the overhead growth they would otherwise commit to because of gnawing uncertainty and a newfound ability to drive higher productivity  thats the big business crowd   
the little guys the small businesses remain in a very defensive crouch  small businesses inventory investment plans are at historically low levels  their capital spending is on hold actual outlays and planned outlays are at record low levels  more small firms according to what i can glean still plan on reducing employment than plan on adding to their payrolls and as you have pointed out mr chairman this is vexing because we all know that during recoveries small firms typically account for a large share of employment gains  weve done some research on this at the dallas fed  in each of the 19831984 1993 and 2003 expansions the vast majority of employment gains were generated by firms with fewer than 500 employees  what we dont know is the degree to which capex expansion of the larger firms drives that growth in employment in smaller firms  for example el paso natural gas has just announced financing for a pipeline it will add 5000 employees to its own payroll but in building that pipeline of course you feed into the small businesses that provide the supplies to those employees and the construction of that pipeline  to the extent that smaller firms are more reliant on bank finance its obvious that their recuperative powers are being affected by tight bank credit 
as to the larger firms that have come to access financial markets rather readily and are less constrained by bank financing they still appear according to my interlocutors reluctant to expand overhead and especially agnostic as to the need yet to expand domestic payrolls 
i will just add to what several presidents have already mentioned by using a specific reference a ceo just came back from touring the world  this is a company that supplies ten million small businesses with a vital component on the it side and his response after the trip was every country i went toindia china the czech republic brazil vietnamsaid what can we do for you how can we help you  well give you low taxes  well give you a building well give you land  i come back here and its you cant do this you cant do that you cant do this you cant do that that attitude mr chairman is definitely having a depressive effect it has nothing to do with monetary policy but it is holding back the desire to expand payroll and capex and adding to the zog and to the nog 
as to the price pressure front headline cpi rates have been increasing steadily these past few months  the 12month headline rate will soon turn positive maybe with tomorrows report  the empire state data released today or yesterday indicate some building price pressure on what comes in the door despite the weakness that was in that report  both core cpi and core pce posted annualized onemonth rates above 2 percent in october and the 12month rates have ticked up to a little over 17 percent  the direction of change from negative to positive might ordinarily ruffle a hawks feathers but for now i remain unalarmed  in part this is because of what accounts for the increase  excise taxes on tobacco sales and a number of small items that are a bit obscure to me other than the prices of new motor vehicles such as the price index for consumption expenditures for nonprofit institutions and two other dodgy financial service components the price index for financial services provided by pension funds and the price index for financial service charges fees and commissions  more encouraging to me is the fact that both the median cpi and the trimmed mean pce show continued deceleration  the fraction of components in the pce registering price declines remains elevated and sustained  according to our calculation over the past 12 months the fraction of falling price components has averaged 40 percent compared with an average 32 percent from 1994 to september of 2008 
having said all of that my outlook for economic growth has not changed  i am not as pessimistic as the new york fed appears to reporta number by the way which i note is strikingly close to what goldman sachs is forecasting  laughter  nor is it as robust and optimistic as what the board staff is projecting  and given all that im seeing now i stick to my previous forecast im somewhere in between the two and having said that i dont think it is too early to begin to think of how we will deleverage our balance sheet and pull back the monetary accommodation we have provided  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you 
vice chairman dudley  can i make an interjection 
chairman bernanke i dont blame you 
vice chairman dudley two things  one mr hatzius who is the chief us economist at goldman sachs right now did win the blue chip forecasting award for accuracy this year laughter 
mr fisher thats ex post past tense 
vice chairman dudley  and two i think i contributed something to his training  laughter so its not surprising that our views are not that far apart 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  i am not sure i have ever seen president dudley blush laughter our information about the fifth district economy has been somewhat mixed lately  surveys indicate the service sector is looking up  the nonretail revenue index has moved back toward positive territoryits not there yethaving been quite weak for several months the retail revenue index has edged into positive territory for the first time since the second quarter of 2007 readings for employment in these two service sectors and expected demand six months ahead have also strengthened noticeably  the manufacturing index has backed off its recent highs however and is hovering around the breakeven mark  anecdotal comments suggest demand has stabilized in many firms after having recovered in the middle of the year and exports are widely cited as a bright spot in the district  our survey measures of price trends remain stable at a low level 
nationally at the last meeting i think most of us were expecting national data to show a moderately paced recovery  the intermeeting data have generally been consistent with that or in some cases a bit better than expected as many have remarked  payroll employment losses have slowed substantially and as is typical in recoveries there were strong upward revisions for prior months initial jobless claims have fallen more than 20 percent in the last six months and the improvement in aggregate hours worked after so many months of stagnation was particularly useful this stabilization in the labor market bolsters the outlook for consumer spending i think  revisions that have added 1 percentage points to the level of personal income cumulatively also bode well for consumption and these developments make the recent growth in retail sales look more sustainable  the recent firming in net exports and residential investment are also supporting domestic production  the strong ism manufacturing readings for production and new orders are consistent with recovery in the manufacturing sector  because the fifth district manufacturing survey led the ism on the way up however it led the much smaller empire state survey and philadelphia surveys as well its recent decline might be a reason for caution about the robustness of manufacturing at the national level  commercial construction is obviously a drag on economic growth but those figures have not come in noticeably worse than expected because expectations were so low to begin with  so overall im expecting moderate growth to continue along the lines of whats in the greenbook but without as much disinflation 
having said that i find it hard to get a bead on just how this recovery is going to shape up over the next year or so i sense a degree of caution among businesses attributable to concerns about the shifting regulatory environment and potential health care and climate change legislation some of my colleagues around the table have remarked on that  in addition uncertainty about the future path of federal deficits i think looms over the outlook as well  so economic growth might not accelerate much from here 
in financial markets rates on an array of shortterm instruments have fallen since the september meetingtbills commercial paper and shortterm eurodollar deposits for example  meanwhile reserve balances have risen by more than 200 billion over the same period this looks a lot like the quantitative easing we were expecting and it may be partly responsible for the decline in other mediumterm rates as well  its not obvious that further easing was really needed over this time frame as the outlook has generally been improving  the magnitude of the effect seems to have been relatively small however and inflation expectations seem to have remained stable 
the case for expecting further disinflation continues to weaken in my view  the greenbooks forecast for 2010 core pce inflation was marked up yet again this time and has doubled since march  the 2009 core forecast has been revised up since then as well as core inflation has failed to fall as expected it looks to me as if the stabilizing effect of inflation expectations has dominated any depressing effect coming from gaps between output and statistical trends in output but im sure we will discuss this at greater length in our special topic tomorrow  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  once again my outlook and business reports have not changed very much over the intermeeting period  most of my contacts currently are seeing continued modest improvement in their businesses but firms continue to be nervous about prospects for the first half of 2010 and theyre not making major new commitments right now  that said some are in the process of making marginal adjustments  the temp firms said that they have now had three months of decent gains in orders mostly for lowwage lightindustrial workers typically this is the first segment of their business to come back after a recession and there were scattered reports from other contacts about some modest rehiring though it is too early to see how meaningful these might be  largely it is the biggest cutters of employment that are rehiring right now on balance most reports indicate that businesses have largely completed the employment and capacity reductions associated with rightsizing their operations for what they expect and when signals point more clearly to a sustainable upturn in the economy they appear ready to make more definite commitments to ramp up production  by the way no one raised the specter of uncertainty over government legislation currently being contemplated but if i asked them later and i did sometimes they said yes but it was not the first thing on their minds 
financial conditions seem to have eased further in a number of markets  risk aversion continues to decline and there are increasing reports of previously sidelined capital moving in the markets in search of higher returns  not surprisingly the chorus of concerns regarding frothiness in financial exuberance seems to be growing and i think you heard about this in berlin according to news reports mr chairman  although these warnings seem premature a couple of them were interesting  for example my private equity director has noted several times that at least a few recent deals have included some of the troublesome features that we saw during the last boom  interest rate toggles light covenant provisions and funding for dividend recaps in exuberant times these lax provisions came bundled together  in recent deals only single provisions have been included still he says he didnt expect to see any of these so soon  in banking however there has been no change in the ongoing complaints and debates  small businesses say credit is overly tight while bankers worry about creditworthiness managerial ability and examiners reactions to new lending 
this divergence between conditions in capital markets and bank credit serves as a reminder that monetary policy is a blunt tool  monetary accommodation will flow to where it can obtain the best return and it is difficult to predict when it will reach particular sectors  currently the liquidity is going to capital markets and while it is helping banks shore up their balance sheets it is not clearly finding its way into new bank lending 
turning to the outlook business and household caution and restrictive bank credit will continue to be headwinds but i expect these to abate more as we move through next year  overall my forecast for real economic activity is about unchanged from last round and we are looking for gdp growth rates over the next year and a half similar to those in the greenbook  with regard to prices resource slack remains large and inflation trends are still well below my guideline of 2 percent at the same time inflation expectations have remained within their recent ranges  so my forecast for inflation is about the same as last round with core pce inflation flattened down a bit in 2010 to 2011 but then moving up to about 1 percent in 2012  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  since the last meeting ive made relatively minor changes to my forecast for economic growth unemployment and inflation  i expect the economy to grow only modestly over the next couple of years with unemployment remaining inordinately high and inflation running below my preferred rate for a very long time  though im not satisfied with this outlook my concerns about the downside risks going forward have continued to diminish since we met in november  a wide range of indicators shows improvement interest rates have come down and equity prices have risen consumer spending has picked up home sales have risen smartly and the global recovery has gained traction 
the positive signs we have seen are welcome as economic activity has fallen so far below where it ought to be there is of course some range of opinion on the extent of slack in the economy  some of my directors characterize it as very large  others insist it is so massive that we will end up with a lost generation of people whose skills and labor market attachment atrophy from disuse in this context the november employment report was clearly good news and it now seems quite likely that employment growth will soon head into positive territory  the workweek and temporary employment both harbingers of future job creation have risen although as david noted the jolts data suggest that hiring rates remain at an exceptionally low level 
it is sobering to realize however that we need an extended string of strong employment reports for unemployment to fall in line with the greenbook projection  in the greenbook nonfarm payroll gains average about 260000 jobs per month over 2010 and 2011 and this is still enough only to lower the unemployment rate to a still elevated 8 percent by the end of 2011  as if the attainment of such gains werent enough of a challenge we might need even larger job creation to bring the unemployment rate down under a reasonable alternative to the greenbooks assumption about labor force participation  the participation rate has fallen about a percentage point since the recession began and the greenbook assumes that participation will fall a bit more historically however participation has been strongly cyclical and if over the next year the participation rate were to rebound by even half a percentage point then we would need another 12 million jobs 100000 more per month just to achieve the same slow decline in the unemployment rate 
last week i showed a forecast much like the greenbooks to my directors  frankly they were incredulous every single one of them thought we were overly optimistic about employment  my contacts are more likely to be considering continued layoffs rather than any substantial hiring indeed one of them said its become fashionable not to be hiring  businesses think that for the foreseeable future they can continue to meet sales demands with productivity improvements  for the foreseeable future their planning horizon appears very short they remain shellshocked and traumatized from recent events  a couple of them emphasize that theyre making plans based on what they see over the next three to six months since they have little confidence looking beyond that horizon  so even though my contacts consistently see signs that demand is starting to recover uncertainty remains high  they remain focused on ensuring their survival and are hesitant to hire or invest beyond replacing essential equipment 
for smaller businesses especially financing conditions also remain an impediment to expansion credit is available but nonprice terms including collateral requirements are viewed as onerous and unattractive this is yet another reflection of the pervasive fear that businesses feel about making commitments that could come back to haunt them  moreover even with the thawing we have seen in credit markets events during the crisis have made firms keenly aware that they cant rely on financial market functioning  so at least some of my contacts plan to keep more cash on their balance sheet permanently rather than deploying it 
of course there are limits to the efficiency improvements that have boosted the aggregate productivity figures so spectacularly limits to how much firms can expand production without adding employees or capital  so when businesses become more confident about the future they will eventually begin hiring in earnest and ramp up capital expenditures  the question is how long it will be before this important element of confidence returns to our economy 
the high degree of slack in labor markets is also making it harder to achieve what i view as a desirable inflation rate of 2 percent for core pce prices  well talk much more about inflation dynamics later in this meeting but one theme of the papers prepared for that discussion is how slack pushes down marginal cost and weve certainly seen that in the data  according to the employment cost index compensation gains this year have been anemic running 2 percentage points or so below their prerecession rates and the strength in productivity has caused unit labor costs to fall markedly over the past year  these disinflationary forces working through slack are at least partially offset by inflation expectations  according to most available measures inflationary expectations are reasonably stable at present 
my staff regularly estimates a model that allows them to decompose the breakeven inflation rate from tips into inflation expectations and an inflation risk premium  their modelimplied expectations for inflation have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range during the last six months although they are down noticeably at all horizons since the beginning of 2009  inflation risk premiums in contrast have risen since the beginning of the year and are now in the somewhat elevated range  these estimates are consistent with the anecdotes we hear concerning the unusually large dispersion of opinion about the longerterm inflation outlook 
all told i agree with the greenbook that the most likely outcome for prices is some further disinflation  if this forecast proves accurate i would expect uncertainty about the inflation outlook to decline and the inflation risk premium to recede  the bottom line is that we are faced with a situation in which inflation is undesirably low and even with large monthly employment gains the level of resource slack will remain high for an extended period  in my forecast the zero bound and the limits on unconventional policy constrain us from pursuing a more desirable and more expansionary policy for some time to come 
chairman bernanke thank you president hoenig 
mr hoenig thank you mr chairman  given the structural challenges that our economy is experiencing and has ahead of it im relatively optimistic about the economy  rather than discussing the national picture because our district mirrors some of the national events ill focus on some of that information 
first of all were experiencing some improvement in our manufacturing sector  its small but systematic and we get fairly good reports back on our surveys  our retail sales reports are up across the district this holiday season has been better than most people expected  we are seeing some slowing down in job losses as others have reported certainly across the region  and even in our housing sector we are seeing modest improvements there as well  our ag sector is actually improving very nicely with improvements in the international sales area with goods sales to china for example and so our ag sector is really quite good right now across the region  even technology seems positive  as one of our contacts described it compared with the tech bubble bust this has been a very mild event for them so theyre much more optimistic as they go forward and think that they will have further strengthening moving from here 
its interesting in talking with some of these individualsits like listening to the fomc  theyre optimistic theyre doing pretty well but theyre not quite sure so theyre holding back waiting for more certainty before they invest and they have a good pocket of money to invest once they gain that confidence to pull the trigger if you will  that was striking in a number of conversations i had with some of the tech people and some of the others who were thinking about investing going forward i think thats worth noting 
as others have said commercial real estate is really quite difficult for banks that are caught up in the commercial real estate cycle  but for our region i think its also important to make some distinctions  in the urban areas where some banks have plunged into commercial real estate theyre in deep trouble and theyre not going to be able to make loans  theyre just hanging on but theres another group of banks that did not plunge as deeply and its a fair percentage of our banks they have kind of the same issue that i talked about earlierthey have the money but they want to be very careful they dont want to get caught up in any false recovery and so they are being very thoughtful before they extend it  even though they have funds their standards are fairly tight and theyre also claiming theyre not seeing the demand from the small business so they have both sides going  but as the economy improves i think a good number of them will be in a position to lend even though there will continue to be a drag from the commercial real estate side 
so overall i think we are on the right track  things are improving in our region and i think i see that in the models on the national economy  i have no major disagreements with the greenbook as we think about things going forward 
i do want to note and make a comment on the issue that jim bullard mentioned  i think that the approach of not reinvesting proceeds in the maturing mbs is a very good approach  and i would tell you that the way i look at it even if you were to do that in 2016 youd still have half your portfolio left but its like phase 1 of this extraction process  we talked earlier about raising the spread letting these roll off and then depending on how the economy recovers we might be more actively engaged in managing that portfolio down if were permitted to do so by circumstances and we should be considering that  part of that hopefully will be discussed tomorrow and certainly a big part of that will be discussed in january and i look forward to both of those conversations thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  i am pleased to see the signs of improvement in the economic data we received during the intermeeting period especially in the november employment report  nonetheless i see the economy in 2010 as having little momentum and as challenged by a lack of business confidence  my business contacts report that sales are up from earlier this year but they dont see the momentum that is needed for a sustained recovery  several of my contacts noted that recent growth is unlikely to be sustained because it was driven by onetime gains  for example business has been picking up in several manufacturing industries because they are replacing inventories at the wholesale level  they indicated that wholesalers had not been restocking earlier in the year  inventory restocking is obviously welcomed but if it is without a sustained improvement in final demand it implies only a temporary strengthening in economic activity 
my business contacts also expressed a general lack of confidence in the outlook they view the current environment as so alien that most of them were uncomfortable providing an outlook for 2010 they tell me that their conventional methods for assessing their own business prospects are irrelevant in this environment  on top of the uncertainties about the economic outlook as others have noted proposals for health care reform financial reform and the new environmental regulations have the potential to affect business conditions significantly in the near future 
i am concerned that this lack of confidence in the economys prospects for even the next few quarters is going to be a significant barrier to a more robust recovery  businesses continue to stress cash preservation and cost containment as their top priorities  they report little incentive or motivation to invest in capital projects  to quote one ceo were not going to invest or prepare for growth without orders in hand  this issue of confidence was also raised in a recent discussion at our joint board of directors meeting among the businesspeople and the bankers on credit availability and bank lending standards 
for large firms which have access to the public debt markets credit is now available on more attractive terms than earlier this year  but as others have commented smaller firms which rely primarily on banks are complaining about the availability of credit  bankers expressed a lack of confidence in the values of their borrowers collateral as one of the main reasons that they have had to raise their lending standards 
many of the businesspeople criticized the higher pricing and tighter terms for lending as being based on unreasonable assessments of their businesses  so they are losing confidence in banks as a reliable source for funds in the face of elevated terms and additional covenants  these reports suggest that credit availability continues to be an impediment to growth particularly if we are counting on small businesses to contribute to economic growth 
my business contacts did have some good news and that is that more firms are expecting to return to profitability  with this improvement several businesses reported that they would at least partially restore hours wages and benefits that had been cut when the outlook was more dire these actions should aid gdp growth even if they have little effect on the unemployment rate for a while more broadly the speed and scale of the cutbacks many businesses implemented earlier this year give firms substantial room to expand activities before they would have to hire any new employees 
weighing all of these reports and the recent data i made only minor changes to my outlook i continue to see weaker gdp growth in the current quarter and for 2010 than the greenbook projection i expect the unemployment rate to remain roughly unchanged in december with only modest improvements through all of next year  my projection for core pce inflation remains low throughout 2010 before it gradually converges towards 2 percent beginning in 2011 my inflation outlook is based on the significant amount of excess capacity that we currently have and inflation expectations that remain close to 2 percent from one to ten years out according to my staffs model for inflation expectations 
i continue to see the risks as balanced around my outlook for economic growth and inflation the potential for the recent momentum in labor markets to continue is roughly offset by the potential for further restraints on credit availability  for inflation uncertainty remains elevated on either side of my projection  this uncertainty is linked closely to whether or not inflation expectations remain anchored  overall the economy is certainly in better shape than earlier this year but it is still not clear to me that the economy has truly turned the corner  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota thank you mr chairman  in the ninth district real economic activity has begun to recover but slowly  the basic sense among our directors and our small business council is that the deterioration in conditions has ended  figures confirm this sense regional unemployment has stabilized although at elevated levels  however our directors also expressed some skepticism about the degree to which this turnaround can be sustained without ongoing government interventions such as the firsttime homebuyer credit  our small business council expressed strong concerns about policy uncertainty related to taxes health care and cap and trade 
nationally the revised estimate of third quarter gdp growth was 28 percent  this increase is better than the preceding four quarters of negative growth  nonetheless output is well below its trend level if we assume that that trend grows at 3 percent per year beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007  the greenbook predicts that gdp will rise by over 4 percent per year over the next two years  based on our minneapolis models forecast i believe that this prediction is somewhat optimistic  but even if the greenbook were right gdp will be well below this 3 percent trend line through the end of 2011 
in terms of labor market conditions the november employment report was heartening  national unemployment has started to decline and employment seemed to stabilize in november  however unemployment remains extremely high by historical standards and i agree with the greenbook that it will remain elevated through 2011  the employmenttopopulation ratio remains at a 25year low 
the inflation front is more promising  inflation remains low  inflationary expectations as measured by blue chip forecasts or tips spreads also remain low  my own expectations are similar  nonetheless i am concerned about a tail risk of a lowprobability but highinflation outcome  the size of the government debt held in the private sector has increased by more than 30 percent in the past two years  this rise in the debt can only be funded by future tax increases spending cuts or higher inflation  any uncertainty about the congresss will to exercise the required fiscal restraint translates directly into uncertainty about current or future inflation 
there is also good news in financial markets  thanks in large part to interventions by the fed key liquidity measures like ted spreads have returned to normal indeed the optionadjusted spread between agency mbs and treasuries has fallen to near historical lows  this improvement in financial markets has significant consequences for policy  liquidity disruptions last fall served to segment financial markets in unprecedented ways  in that environment the lsap played a valuable role by lowering risk premiums in the agency debt and mbs markets  however the return to normalcy in spreads across financial markets indicates the degree of market segmentation is at a minimum greatly reduced  without such segmentation the impact of reducing our holdings of agency mbs or treasury debt on their yields is likely to be muted  i would at a minimum be supportive of not reinvesting the proceeds from the lsap either from the agency securities or from the treasury debt 
overall the real side of the economy is recovering somewhat  however detrended gdp is well below historical norms and unemployment is well above the historical norms  and this characterization seems likely to continue well into 2011  inflation is under control and is expected to remain so although the size of the government debt represents a possible large risk  financial markets continue to improve and are much stronger than a year ago  thank you mr chairman  
chairman bernanke thank you vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  the economic outlook has clearly improved since the previous meeting and we all seem to agree on that  on the real activity side heres what strikes me as most meaningful  first is a more solid foundation for consumer spending as david wilcox pointed outa higher underlying compensation trend as well as slower job losses and rising hours worked last month  second is consumer spending gainscore retail sales in november were quite solid for example and real consumer spending looks likely to grow at a moderate rate this quarter  third as nathan pointed out is trade improvement fueled by export growth not just export growth on its own but also supported by pretty strong economic expansion outside the us  and fourth is something that hasnt been mentioned yetit looks as if some of the tarp monies are going to be used to fund a modest jobs program so the trajectory of fiscal stimulus may not be as steeply downward as we go through 2010 as we anticipated earlier 
but i dont want to put too much weight on any of this  first i think much of this improvement was anticipated  i think its more that were moving along the path that we expected rather than we are moving to a distinctly better path  second there are significant constraints in terms of credit availability and i dont see any sign that those have changed very much since the last meeting  third we still have a tremendous amount of political uncertainty about health care reform financial reform and tax policy  in talking to our directors they make it very clear that this is a factor influencing their hiring behavior  although job losses have slowed this seems to be almost exclusively due to much slower layoffs than due to a pickup in hiring 
so for the new york fed richard the bottom line is more confidence about the sustainability of the recovery but still an expectation that the economy will slow a bit from the current pace in 2010 that said i think the risks to our forecast are shifting towards the upside from the downside 
we should also recognize that we face a very disappointing path for unemployment going forward so even if the economy is on a somewhat stronger growth path that would be very welcome right now and i would argue we should not offset that with changes in our policy 
on the inflation side i think the outlook has not changed much  we have tips fiveyear fiveyear forward inflation measuresit may in fact be slightly higher than that but its hard to know because the inflation risk premiums are hard to extract  and some other indicators certainly show less anxiety about the inflation outlook  for example the fears about commodity prices and the dollar seem to have calmed down quite a bit since the last meeting  interestingly the midmonth university of michigan reading had an almost bizarre drop in the median oneyear and fiveyear inflation forecastmaybe it was just a fluke but it was interesting nevertheless 
given the large amount of federal borrowing and the imminent windup of our largescale assetpurchase program i am frankly quite surprised that longterm rates have not climbed more sharply  and i take that as another sign that investors are either not that worried about the longterm fiscal outlook or particularly worried about the risk of higher inflation  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  we have had several encouraging signs about the strength and sustainability of the recovery not enough to warrant a major change in the outlook but were moving in the right direction  my list is the same as the list that everyone else has read out so very briefly private demand has been stronger especially in consumption supported by more income growth  business spending on capital equipment does seem to be moving a little higher growth is beginning to feed through to reduced job loss and higher hours and financial conditions are improving in markets with declines in bond rates increases in stock prices and securities markets are open to substantial capitalraising albeit at still somewhat elevated risk premiums  foreign growth is a bit stronger on balance so the pickup is global its not idiosyncratic to the us and it should support export growth 
i think there are a couple of possible reasons for a slightly stronger outlook  some of it is pentup demand perhaps  the level of spending on consumer durables and capital equipment has been below replacement levels although in my view the stock of consumer durables and capital was probably above longterm sustainable levels coming into the recession reflecting an unsustainable level of consumption and investment but wear and technological improvements are making updating and replacement more attractive for households and businesses 
with the return of risk appetite in financial markets financial constraints may be a little less binding than we expected at least for those with access to securities markets where low policy interest rates are feeding through the cost of capital  and markets are opening up to more securitization in selected segments partly through the influence of talf 
capital reflows to emerging markets along with expansionary fiscal policies abroad are lifting asset prices and supporting income growth especially in emerging asia  still in my view incoming information has also tended to confirm the existence of several constraints on spending that are likely to keep the improvement in the economy gradual and the decline in the unemployment rate quite slow 
the contribution of the rebound in housing will be much more limited than usual in a recovery and the information weve gotten since the last meeting confirmed that starts and permits for singlefamily homes over recent months have been quite flat and for multifamilies theyve dropped quite substantially  prices of homes have moved down again at least by one measure and oncoming foreclosures are likely to limit any gains in prices and the vacancy rate is still quite high indicating that there are plenty of existing homes available to meet demand and constrain new building 
as many have remarked bank credit remains quite tight and growth in the money supply has been modest  to date theres little evidence that the huge quantity of reserves is materially affecting the supply of money and bank credit  spreads on business loans from banks widened further over the past three months  small businesses perceive credit availability to be quite limited  credit card rates have risen substantially thats partly in anticipation of regulatory pricing constraints but it does raise the cost of capital of households and small businesses  and bank loans have continued to drop very very rapidly 
many foreign economies may be constrained in the degree to which they will support faster global growth japan seems to be fighting against a strengthening deflationary trend amid enough concerns about the economic outlook there to foster additional stimulus from both the fiscal and monetary authorities  i thought the staff forecast for japan was on the optimistic side  the euro area is threatened by sovereign debt crises across its southern tier and in ireland which at a minimum will necessitate a severe tightening of fiscal policies in many countries  and its not clear how long emerging asia can carry the world economy without exacerbating imbalances and worries about excessive credit creation and asset bubbles 
to be sure the repeated modest upside surprises to activity over the summer and fall do suggest some upside risk to the forecast  it could be that confidence is gradually rebuilding and theres a positive interaction with the financial markets that could gather steam  but there are downside risks as well we are removing a substantial number of governmental props to the financial markets and the economy over the next several quarters  the mortgage market is a particular concern as we stop our mbs purchases  the us treasury will be constrained in its backstop of the gses after yearend and there will be no clarity on the ultimate fate of these agencies for some time probably a year or more  and some areas of securitization appear to be less ready to stand on their own than others suggesting that some borrowers will face higher costs as talf is terminated  additionally the substantial support that fiscal policy has provided to spending will be winding down in the second half of next year and questions about fiscal sustainability will constrain any new stimulus now or if the economy falters 
in an environment of high unemployment and excess capital capacity i expect intense competition among workers and businesses to keep costs low and the underlying trend of inflation stable at a low rate that is a rate below my objective andor perhaps even trending lower and i think the data on price movements that we have gotten over the intermeeting period broadly support this outlook  energy prices have lifted headline inflation in recent months but oil prices have fallen considerably in recent weeks  import prices have also added some to inflation but the most recent stabilization of the dollar should limit the extent of those effects core cpi increases have been relatively flat at a fairly low 1 percent on balance over the past six months core pce has picked up a bit but that reflects nonmarket prices  marketbased core pce has continued to go lower to around 1 percent  the trend in unit labor costs remains downward reflecting both strong productivity increases and damped compensation  and there are some hints in the survey data that longterm inflation expectations may be moving down a little although its too early to make anything of those surveys and the marketbased measures of longterm expectations remain at the top of recent ranges  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me spend most of my time on financial markets with just a few words on the real economy which i think are consistent with many of yours at the last couple of fomc meetings i like several of you argued that the next few quarters were going to be considerably stronger than the next few years  i think we finally have some data that bear that out  first the remarkable melting up in credit and financial markets which we have all been noting for quite some time seems to be doing remarkable things to help get this economy going over the near term  second is the jobs front which president yellen and many of you talked about  i think the job creation story is both a function of nearterm prospects and mediumterm prospects and if mediumterm prospects are as uncertain as many of us have described then we should not be so surprised that the job engine iseffectively dead perhaps overstateseffectively impaired for some time 
while its difficult not to see some good news in the most recent labor market prints and unemployment prints let me try  firings have certainly leveled out but i do think whats happening on the small business stuff is more than just politicians approaching evennumbered yearsit does appear to be much more substantial than that  and the probability as president yellen said that workers who lose jobs will spend more time out of work and the harm that could be doing to a generation of underemployed workers early in their careers strikes me as something that could well be structural and a cause for real concern 
i remain concerned about other possible outcomes to the real economy in late 2010 and beyond while the productivity surge has been more impressive than i thought it would be its hard to know how much of these improvements are cyclical and how much of them are structural and enduring historically earlystage spurts in productivity have been followed by rising unemployment but maybe this time its different  maybe amid the range of uncertainties employment and even hours worked may be slower to rebound which could extend the period of strong productivity gains and productivitydriven growth without doing much to make us feel much better about the labor market situation 
on the financial market side let me make reference to three themes  at the last fomc meeting i think we discussed the fact that the financial markets seem to be nearing an important inflection point with some real possible impacts on the broad economy  so key theme number one is dubai really about dubai and greece really about greece  i think there are dozens of dubais out there that is entities with the implicit support of their sovereigns and i think the relevant question is are the expected consolidated debttogdp ratios consistent or inconsistent with current funding costs  markets for now seem to be largely comfortable with sovereign credits generally and with sovereign support of offbalancesheet liabilities  think of abu dhabi and dubai think of the eu and greece and there are very few spillovers across markets  cds for some of the sovereigns as brian mentioned at the outset seem to be moving a bit but i think we should be extremely worried about some nonlinear moves  so i am skeptical that the current comfort in financial markets will hold  bond market prices globally may be masking disturbing trends and while the official statistics on government debttogdp ratios and associated measures of liabilities are growing if we added these implicit liabilities the numbers really could be quite staggering 
think about the us circumstance  if we added the liabilities of fannie and freddie to the debttogdp ratio here our sovereign debttogdp would double overnight  then if you go out into the medium term the numbers become even more alarming  i dont mean to take us back to the early days of the panic but what if markets come to think of these offbalancesheet liabilities as the sivs offbalancesheet entities but this time of the official sector  the average terms of many sovereigns funding including our treasury have shortened throughout much of 2009 and the problems of maturity mismatch are not unique to the private sector or unique to the us government  so i wonder whether governments are properly gauging their true mediumterm costs of funding and if complacency is in fact finding its way into financial markets we cannot discount the prospect of some of these nonlinear outcomes in the financial markets which would certainly do great harm to the economy 
key theme number two old money chasing old products  so whats that reference it looks to me as though what we are seeing in asset allocation is fund flows coming out of the money market and money market mutual funds and other assets that are yielding close to nothing investors that are tired of earning zero as they see markets melting up around them and they are investing that in assets  but most of these assets are not new assets  theres not a tremendous supply of new issuance coming to marketfrankly theres less new supply than i would have thought brian talked about the new supply of mortgagebacked securities being relatively scant  i think that is true across a range of markets  in some ways we are seeing older vintages of assets getting bid up  if i compare the refrains from the recent boom in asset prices with current conditions we can all remember a couple of years ago folks showing up and saying i have got 3000 to pay for my mortgage payment this month  how much house can i get  the 20092010 version of that is an investor showing up and saying i need libor plus 400  what am i buying today so i would prefer in general to be seeing new money evaluating new products rather than old money chasing old products but i think thats a sense of where we are 
but all my themes arent negative  so let me leave with a final positive theme in financial markets  as brian said at the outset we have seen a couple of differing moves both in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and in commodity prices  we saw this oneway bet on dollar and commodity prices a weaker dollar higher gold higher metals for much of the intermeeting period but it has reversed over the course of the last ten days or so  i happen to think that reversal is healthy  i happen to think that a twoway market across these key asset classes is probably a good thing a stronger dollar commodities a bit weaker in the last ten days and reaction to recent stronger data in the us on payrolls and consumer spending and more worries about european prospects tell me these markets are acting a little bit more as we had long thought they would  they seem somewhat healthier in responding to relative growth rates and expectations of relative rate differentials with the us frankly standing up relatively favorably against the uk and the european union  before the last 10 days many of these commodities were near multidecade highs  risks of oneway bets and even bubble conditions in certain assets as a result may be mitigated if what were seeing is something more than a head fake i think those trends on the dollar and commodities are important to watch  i think they likely offer an important view on what happens to inflation expectations going forward  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor duke 
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  in general the bankers are looking for some sign of the top in their credit deterioration and with the exception of cre everybody seems to feel like it is just around the corner that they are very close but nobody can support it yet with any real evidence they expect that the nonperformers will peak in 2010 and chargeoffs will peak in late 2010 or early 2011 
every banker i spoke withprobably because they were just coming out of or still wrestling with their 2010 profit planningwas focused on the need to find loans in order to generate income  they said that the loans that theyre currently booking are of high quality  pricing actually has gone from being great to being simply good  theres widespread use of interest rate floors and theyre beginning to see some competition both in rates and in terms  most are reluctant to add any mortgagebacked securities to their investment portfolios because theyre afraid of what happens when we stop buying or when we sell  and a number of them are actually harvesting gains in their existing portfolio because those gains are a significant part of their capital and they need to lock them up transaction volume is shifting heavily from credit cards to debit cards and total transaction volume is up while the average ticket is down indicating that consumers are spending from money that they have rather than money that theyre borrowing 
on the regulatory front a number of them reported examiners not willing to follow the new cre guidance the reports to me were all about fdic and occ examiners and theyre singularly unwilling to use any appeals process or ombudsman to talk about this with those regulators none of them mentioned federal reserve examiners and we could assume from that that there were no federal reserve examiners who were unwilling to follow the guidance but i think it would probably be better if we were vigilant with our own troops as well  on the new overdraft rules i talked to one bank that has estimated a 15 to 20 percent hit to earnings per share and has calculated that in the past the cost of providing checking accounts has been increasingly covered by overdraft fees which led to a proliferation of free checking  in order to reverse this to accommodate the new overdraft rules the breakeven for checking accounts is likely to be somewhere around 10 per month per account 
ive been struck by the sharp decline in cost and the increase in availability of credit in the debt markets while the opposite seems to be happening in credit provided through banks  so i took a look at loan volumes and found a very different story for the large versus the small banks the larger banks typically have mortgage credit card large business middlemarket lending the top 25 banks have 70 percent of the ci loans 73 percent of the mortgages and 80 percent of the card debt  they have made extensive use of fed facilities federal home loan bank and fdic guaranteed debt and theyre much further along in emerging from the financial crisis they do have access to capital markets and have repaid or are planning to repay their tarp 
in contrast the problems for small banks started later and are still building  they have big construction and cre portfolios in fact 60 percent of the total cre loans outstanding are in the smaller banks  they have 30 percent of the ci loans although those loans are predominantly to small businesses  they fund through deposits federal home loan banks cdars and brokered deposits  they have limited access to capital and many of those who did not get tarp either because they were not allowed to or because they elected not to now wish they had it as they work through this cre cycle and are finding problems 
given the sharp reduction in bank lending i took a look at loan balances in the third quarter of 2009 compared with yearend 2007  while banks of all sizes have reduced loans the big reduction has been in the top 20 banks that are just below the top five for the top five loans are down just under 2 percent for the next 20 loans are down more than 10 percent and for all others loans are down about 2 percent so theres a real concentration in those 20  inside of commercial real estate the construction land development where the portfolios have been hit the hardest are down 25 percent in banks below the top five while loans on existing nonresidential real estate are actually up across the board 
finally i decided to focus on the two politically hot categories mortgage modifications and small business  to size the mortgage modification problem 57 million mortgages are now 60 days past due with 23 million in the process of foreclosure roughly equivalent to a years sales of existing homes  i talked to one large lender servicer who was able to give me some breakdown in the hamp he said 20 percent are not owneroccupied 20 percent have less than 31 percent dti and 20 percent dont qualify for other reasons 10 percent are underemployed or unemployed  of the remaining 30 percent half dont accept the offer  banks were encouraged to get the numbers up by putting people in trial modifications and then gathering the documentation during the trial period  of those who have made their payments onethird have submitted all of their documents onethird have presented partial documents and onethird have submitted no documents 
the banks are still modifying many loans outside of hamp but the loans previously modified are redefaulting and rising unemployment is working against them  the clock is still ticking banks are now formalizing and streamlining shortsale processes and investing in staffing systems and training but were still likely to see three to four million foreclosures  however they will be spaced out over two to three years due to all of the foreclosure prevention efforts the timing of redefaults judicial foreclosure processes and staffing issues 
on the new loan front fannie mae has now raised cutoff fico scores for even 80 percent mortgages which would potentially affect as many as 30 million borrowers  the fha is studying both fico and downpayment requirements  so even in the governmentsupported space term tightening continues 
turning to small business lending in the nfib survey 15 percent said credit was more difficult to obtain which compares with a 12 percent level in 1990  but only 5 percent ranked credit as their most important problemit is well behind weak sales at 33 percent taxes at 20 percent government regulations and red tape at 13 percent and even the cost and availability of insurance at 8 percent 
our data on small businesses was last done in 2003 but at that point we estimated that only 1 percent of small business borrowing comes from the sba  with the sba the expanded loan guarantee program is now out of money  changes were made to increase the guarantee to 90 percent with a maximum loan size of 1 percent and allow refinancing of existing credit  there is a house bill that would extend the program and increase loan sizes  as you might expect commercial banks are the primary providers of credit supplying twothirds of the total credit but of that approximately 40 percent are borrowed under a commercial mortgage  the smaller banks usually underwrite them individually but they take some form of collateral preferably real estate to compensate for less reliable financial statements the mixing of personal and business assets and low capitalization so i would estimate that at least half of the commercial real estate and more than 90 percent of the ci loans in the smaller banks are small business loans larger banks are underwriting centrally using creditscoring models and moving to limit local overrides  theyre reporting losses similar to unsecured consumer credit and the larger credit card issuers have now designed business card products to work like a traditional line of credit but theyre concerned about the prospect of business lines coming under the same restrictions as consumer credit 
we hear so much about businesses failing due to lack of credit  i tried to find data on the rate of business failure one bank had researched its own experience and found to its surprise that the rate of business failure was not substantially different from earlier cycles  they have hypothesized that low rates have allowed businesses to hang on longer  so the small business job formation problem appears likely to be a new business formation with new businesses usually funded with personal borrowing and funds from family and friends rather than bank credit given widespread balance sheet impairment i suspect new business formation to be quite low while sba programs might help on the margin i concluded that the best assistance for small businesses comes from low interest rates enforcement of cre guidelines and improving consumer wealth  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  let me first say i know how pleased everyone must be that we are getting through the goround this afternoon so that we will have plenty of time tomorrow for our special though regrettably untelevised version of who wants to be an inflation fighter laughter  i have read the transcript 
developments since our previous meeting have obviously been positive on balance though not uniformly so  the lateyear improvement probably reduces somewhat further the likelihood of what i have previously characterized as a relapse scenario  but even if this modest trend continues through december i dont think a stronger than expected fourth quarter fundamentally changes the outlook for 2010  in this regard there remains the important question whether or more precisely how much selfsustaining demand will fill in behind the withdrawal of stimulus over the course of next year  for the reasons many of us have rehearsed at previous meetings and that some of you have repeated this afternoon the answer to this question is quite uncertain 
one area that unfortunately looks all too certain is unemployment  even the most optimistic of private forecasters believe that unemployment will remain at very elevated levels throughout next year quite apart from the social and longerterm economic damage that may be effected by prolonged high unemployment my intuition continues to be that a level of 9 or 10 percent places a significant limit on the growth of personal consumption expenditures unless one expects that compensation levels will themselves rise steadily 
obviously then the contribution of wealth effects would be important for a sustained acceleration in consumption as in fact we see reflected in the forecasts of those who do anticipate stronger pce growth here again though there is considerable uncertainty  indeed i have noted that even those who sit together on the more optimistic end of the spectrum of forecasts for 2010 disagree on whether housing or equities will be the key driver of rising wealth 
as to housing at least while i can tell the story of reduced inventories lower prices and less new home construction moving residential real estate eventually in a positive direction i can equally conceive of such factors as more foreclosures associated with unemployment and a possible jump in mortgage rates associated with the end of our mbs purchases leading to stagnant or even slightly declining home prices 
to be fair i should also note that some on the more pessimistic end of the 2010 spectrum have been a bit undone by the revisions to 2009 data that revealed a higher saving rate than had previously been assumed thereby undermining the argument that saving will inevitably jump a good deal next year with consequent negative effects on pce 
but this example makes my point as readily as the cloudiness around the more upbeat commentaries we are still learning exactly how the different characteristics of a deep financially induced recession might confound expectations developed through experience with each of the recessions in the last 60 years whether mild moderate or severe  we will not have the luxury of waiting to see all these differences unfold as we make our policy decisions  we will necessarily be navigating in somewhat uncharted waters but to this point i believe we have yet to see a credibly strong current flowing by us 
my basic outlook is thus essentially unchanged from november despite the noteworthy developments since that time  nearterm prospects remain moderately positive with the important major qualification of employment  as to the second half of 2010 and beyond a forecast of incrementally to moderately above trend growth remains the best bet but i continue to see significant though reduced downside risks and growing though still modest upside risks as well thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you i know youre all expecting a crisp linear summary of the goround but i see that its past 530 laughter so why dont we adjourn for a reception and dinner and well see you the first thing in the morning at 900 am thank you 
meeting recessed 

december 16 2009morning session 
meeting attendees greeted chairman bernanke with a standing ovation when he entered the meeting room in recognition of his being named time magazines person of the year 2009 
chairman bernanke the power of the media laughter thank you very much 
mr warsh  a little extra pressure for your pithy summary of yesterdays discussion  laughter 
chairman bernanke we want to start today with bill wascher who will give us some updates on data 
mr wascher2 footnote 2 the materials used by mr wascher are appended to this transcript appendix 2 end footnote 2   thank you mr chairman  we received two data releases this morninghousing starts and the cpiand you should have in front of you a threepage handout that summarizes the data  the first page summarizes the housing starts data and you can see from the top line that total starts moved up to an annual rate of 574000 units in november with increases in starts of both singlefamily and multifamily units  the jump in multifamily starts which is about halfway down the table basically reverses a sharp dip in october and that was in line with our expectations  while singlefamily starts also increased that increase was smaller than we were expecting permits which are a better underlying measure of starts increased more than starts in november but the combination of the permits and starts figures in november was weaker than we were expecting and it suggests to us that our nearterm forecast for singlefamily starts is probably too optimistic  while i would still think that a gradual improvement in new home sales will lead to a more noticeable pickup in the pace of starts next year these data suggest that the upturn is lagging a little bit more than we were projecting  the implications of these data for gdp are mainly for the first quarter given the lag between starts and construction these data and our reaction to them would probably take off a tenth or two of a percentage point from our forecast for gdp growth in the first quarter 
the next page summarizes the data for the cpi  the total cpi rose 04 percent in november which is what we were expecting for the headline number  however energy prices rose a largerthanexpected 41 percent last month while core prices were about unchanged in november to two decimal places they rose three basis points  we had been expecting an increase in the core index of about 01 percent  the softness was concentrated in prices of services especially in rents  in contrast core goods prices rose 02 of a percent in november with noticeable increases in tobacco prices and in motor vehicle prices 
it looks as if yesterdays ppi release and todays cpi release taken together will imply a lower estimate of core pce inflation in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter than we had in the greenbook in particular it looks as if well be down from 16 percent in the fourth quarter in the greenbook to 12 percent for core pce price inflation and in the first quarter down from 13 percent to 11 percent  for the total pce price index we would revise our estimate for the fourth quarter from 28 percent to 26 percent for the first quarter because of the higher energy prices we would still be at 11 percent thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you any questions for bill no response okay i did have overnight to put together my pithy summary so let me just try to summarize what i thought was a good discussion yesterday 
economic indicators since the last meeting were generally a bit more positive than expected participants cited the november labor report retail sales trade data housing and financial developments as positive  global economic growth is picking up more so in emerging markets than in advanced economies some of which remain weak  however although downside risks to growth may be a bit smaller most participants were not ready to revise their expectations substantially for 2010 from previous projections of moderate growth and continued high unemployment  anecdotes repeatedly cited uncertainties on the part of business leaders about both nearterm and mediumterm prospects reflecting questions about the economy itself and a range of government policies including fiscal climate regulatory and others  these uncertainties which are shared by the meeting participants seem likely to retard new investment and hiring for some time  participants also debated whether private final demand will be sustained as government supports are withdrawn  housing provides an example  although there have been some significant improvements these may not continue next year as the fed stops buying mbs the gses reduce their portfolios and tighten terms the firsttime homebuyer tax credit ends and slow progress in mortgage modification fails to prevent another wave of foreclosures and distressed sales  on the inflation front price changes seem reasonably well controlled with some expecting further moderation especially in core inflation but others citing possible mediumterm risks   
looking at a bit more detail recent data on consumer spending were encouraging as noted income and saving this year were stronger than initially estimated  household wealth is increasing and sentiment has recently improved some  evidence on christmas buying is mixed  consumers appear to be aggressive in limiting ticket sizes and pursuing discounts  households were likely encouraged by somewhat better news about the labor market but high unemployment seems likely to cap growth in consumer confidence and spending 
in the labor market elements of good news besides reduced job loss included increased hours reduced unemployment claims and more temporary hires  however although job losses have moderated firms remain quite reluctant to hire and conditions overall remain very weak  extended high unemployment which seems likely if growth is not much above trend could leave lasting scars on the labor force 
as also noted ceos remain cautious  large firms have good access to credit but are holding lots of cash rather than hiring and investing  smaller bankdependent firms find credit much more difficult to obtain although there was some difference of view as to whether these constraints would prevent small firms from expanding when demand picks up  productivity gains have been significant as firms have cut costs or looked to meet demand without adding workers certain segments are performing better including some manufacturing businesses high tech and agriculture and shippers have seen an uptick in their business 
financial markets continue to improve although the risk of relapse cannot be ignored  some markets such as securitization markets are still not functioning well  generally asset values do not seem out of line with fundamentals although as investors have become less cautious they may have also become less discriminating  market sentiment has been strong enough to overcome setbacks like the dubai episode but this episode may be indicative of the vulnerability of sovereign credits  banks are raising capital and in some cases paying back the tarp bank credit however continues to contract reflecting lack of demand weak borrower quality the risky macro environment and bank concerns about their own capital positions  some banks complain about overzealous examiners  banks are looking for credit losses to top out in 2010 except in commercial real estate  large and small banks have different portfolio mixes with small banks particularly vulnerable to the worsening cre problem and many are still likely to fail  small banks are also more likely to be lenders to small businesses 
inflation seems reasonably controlled  core inflation seems to be moderating though the underlying trend is not entirely clear not only because of some energy passthrough but also some special factors including an increase in the prices of nonmarket components  the median cpi and trimmed mean pce inflation are flat to down  anecdotes suggest that firms have limited ability to raise prices in most cases  compensation figures were revised up but wage growth in general still appears quite moderate and unit labor costs are further reduced by strong productivity that is in terms of the models marginal costs do not seem to be rising quickly  inflation expectations are broadly stable though inflation risk premiums increase the difficulty of extracting these expectations from tips as has been the case views around the table differed on the size of the output gap and its relevance to inflation determination  energy price increases and declines in the dollar have recently reversed 
mediumterm risks other than the feds balance sheet include the us fiscal situation and import costs  we discussed the structure of the feds policy regime including exitsequencing and the development and communication of a policy rule  thats my overview of what i heard obviously theres diversity among the group  are there any comments or questions no response 
as always its very difficult to add intelligent new and insightful ideas after all of you have already spoken but let me just say a couple things  first like everybody else i was heartened by the intermeeting data and i think i may have taken just a bit more signal than some of you from it  in particular even though the overall economic growth in the second half was not much changed by the revised data the contour was changed  the third quarter was weaker the fourth quarter looks to be relatively strong perhaps 4 percent or more and so there is a sense of somewhat more momentum going into 2010 
at the same time we saw developments particularly in the consumer sector which are a bit encouraging towards the view that as inventory adjustments follow through and as other temporary factors weaken final demand will be able to pick up and continue the moderate recovery that we anticipate in 2010 so like most of you i havent significantly revised my modal forecast but i do have somewhat more confidence that the momentum will be sustained into looking specifically at the consumer a number of things were encouraging  i think the simple fact that there was more demand for housing and autos is actually encouraging not just in terms of total spending dollars but also because the willingness of consumers to commit to longerterm durable goods is in itself an indication of greater confidence in their own income and the future of the economy  and more generally we did see improved attitudes as measured for example with the michigan survey  althoughlets be carefultheyre still very low in historical terms and though the current conditions index improved considerably the expected conditions measure didnt do very much  so we are seeing some improvement there but again we should be cautious 
on consumer fundamentals we have seen the upgrade of income which as some have noted helps explain how you can consume more and save more at the same timelaughter which has been happening  and there are some positive developments for example in energy prices which will help real income in inflation expectations which help expected real income and in wealth on the latter as we saw in the flow of funds data about a third of the losses have been reversed so far so there is some continued improvement on that front  thats all positive and it gives us more sense that the consumer will not fade as the handoff happens 
on the labor market i think we can find a few positive elements  weve noted a number of things from the labor market report  i think more generally there are some indications that the recovery will not be as jobless as it was in the last two recessions given the depth of the decline therefore theres likely to be a tendency for jobs to come back given that the productivity gains weve seen are not sustainable and that theres going to have to be some mean reversion so if you put together moderate growth likely weaker productivity gains some strength in a few individual industriesmanufacturing and othersthe presumption is that we will see some job creation and some positive payroll numbers pretty soon 
that being said i think i would come back to the theme i echoed in a couple of speeches over the intermeeting period  i still see the labor market and the credit market and the interaction between them as being major risks and drags on the expansion  in the labor market i think its really important for us to keep in mind what a deep hole were currently in  to give two numbers that you dont always cite the employmenttopopulation ratio has fallen from a peak of 627 percent to 585 in the most recent montha very substantial decline in the number of people working the aggregate weekly hours of production workers has fallen more than 8 percent from the peak compare that with a decline of less than 6 percent in the 19811982 recessionthere has been an enormous decline in labor input  and as a number of people noted starting with president rosengren that decline in labor input is not simply bodies it is on other dimensions as wellhours per week overtime and so on  and as was also noted as labor input increases it will happen across a variety of margins and not just on the unemployed  in fact given the duration of unemployment and the number of people who will be losing skills and labor force attachment there may be some preference as firms go out and look for workers to expand on the intensive margin rather than on hiring people who will not be as attractive from the employers perspective  just to give you a sense simple arithmetic says that an increase of 20 minutes in the average workweek is equivalent to one and a half million jobs in terms of labor input so there is a very substantial substitutability across those dimensions 
the second area that i talked about in my remarks over the intermeeting period of course is credit it was noted around the table by a number of people that credit availability for large firms including large banks appears to be quite good surprisingly good to some extent whereas for small businesses that are bankdependent obviously conditions are much more difficult there was an interesting discussion around the table about how significant the constraints on small business credit will be  a number of people noted that the nfib surveys put small business views about tight credit as being only fourth or fifth on the list of concerns but remember we are now in a period where in some sense the binding constraint is demand  the question is what will happen when there is scope for expansion and will firms be able to get the credit they need to expand  i think it is instructive to recall the post19901991 recession period the period of the famous financial headwinds when banking conditions were much less severe than now credit extension was much better nfib indicators and the terms of credit from the survey of senior loan officersall of those things were less severe than they are today in the economy so my best guess is that we will see some concerns about credit as the expansion begins and that will be a reason for more moderate economic growth 
contributing to that is that the situation is not like the post19901991 period where the problems fairly quickly resolved themselves over the subsequent couple of years  were continuing to look as a number of people have noted at still rising npl rates commercial real estate credit and other issues that will put stress on the banking sector  and notably governor duke made some very interesting points about the differences in product mixes between large and small banks  in particular small banks are both more vulnerable to the cre problem and are a bigger source of credit for small businesses and local economies 
again to summarize the two parts of my remarks there the first was that i thought that the intermeeting data were encouraging in the sense that the moderate growth scenario looks more plausible and the risks to it seem less but i dont see a great deal at this point to suggest that economic growth will be much greater than the moderate pace scenario  going back to the jobless recovery theme i think it is striking that the staff is projecting 200000 to 300000 jobs a month starting in the second quarter with even more in 2011 and even so unemployment rates remain at 96 percent at the end of next year for example  so given those two things given the depth of the hole were in were going to need a lot of jobs to get back to more normal conditions 
i think inflation conditions are fairly stable though obviously not entirely satisfactory in all dimensions  over the intermeeting period we did see oil prices down about 10 although distant futures prices did not change much so that doesnt really change the trajectory very much i was actually kind of encouraged to see the way the dollar has changed its behavior  weve had this funny pattern where whenever theres a good day in the stock market the dollar drops because of this safehaven effect  since the november employment report weve gotten a more normal positive correlationgood news about the us economy is good news for the dollar i think thats encouraging because it means that economic growth will not translate immediately into those kinds of import inflation pressures  people discussed the difficulties of interpreting the tips spreads  my overall sense is that theres not a major shift in the inflation expectations of the financial markets  likewise the surveys of forecasters and households are also fairly benign so all of those things i think are moderately encouraging 
that being said i do feel we are in some sense walking on eggshells because there are so many delicate issues of confidence in financial institutions in our fiscal position in the feds policies and exit strategy that there just seems to be a greater and pervasive sense of instability and risk given what we have been through in the last couple of years  but again i think overall the intermeeting period was good and although were still a long way from where we want to be were moving at least at some speed in the right direction 
 so let me stop there  are there further questions or comments about the economy no response in my summary i took note of our interest in discussing in january the elements of our policy frameworkhow we would think about exit and how we would think about communication and perhaps policy rules as well so well be in touch with you about some of those issues if there are no further comments ill turn to brian to start the second round 
mr madigan3 footnote 3 materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3 end footnote 3   thanks mr chairman  i will be referring to the package 
labeled material for briefing on monetary policy alternatives  this package 
includes the draft policy statements for alternatives a b and c as they appeared in 
the bluebook 

your policy decision today takes place against a backdrop of a gradual but fairly 
steady improvement in financial conditions and in the economic outlook  as david 
noted yesterday the staffs forecast for economic growth in the fourth quarter has 
been revised up noticeably and the staff sees the rate of expansion picking up steam
 over the next couple of years reaching 4 percent in 2011  moreover as noted yesterday some of you see the downside risks to the forecast as continuing to ebb extending a trend evident in your most recent quarterly forecasts  nonetheless resource slack seems likely to remain substantial for some time  in the greenbook forecast that slack together with stable inflation expectations pushes inflation down to about 1 percent by the end of the forecast period   
with output seen as tracking well below its potential over the next few years and inflation projected to be edging further below the level that policymakers prefer over the intermediate term the committee might be dissatisfied with the outlook and believe that it could improve economic outcomes by providing additional policy stimulus  the committee might also see additional stimulus as warranted in order to guard against the lingering risk that spending output and employment could fall well short of the baseline outlookfor example because financial market conditions could relapse as a range of government support programs are withdrawn over the next few months  under alternative a page 2 of the package the committee would provide additional stimulus by boosting its purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities from the currently planned amount of 125 trillion to 15 trillion  in order to accomplish the increase in purchases without putting undue strain on the mbs market the committee would extend the time frame for these transactions through the end of the second quarter planned purchases of agency debt securities would stay at 175 billion the committee would also leave its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 0 to  percent  but it would alter its forward guidance slightly to indicate that it anticipated that economic conditions would warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds ratethat is 0 to  percentfor an extended period of time thus underscoring the low for long message  market participants appear to see little likelihood of an increase in asset purchases and thus staff estimates suggest that a 250 billion increase in mbs purchases might lower longerterm rates by 10 to 25 basis points and through that channel reduce the unemployment rate two years ahead by a tenth or two of a percentage point relative to the rate that would otherwise prevail   
if the committee instead believes that in current circumstances additional monetary policy stimulus would not be helpful on balance it might prefer to adopt the policy actions and language of alternative b page 3  for example even though the outlook for real activity and employment may be unsatisfactory policymakers might also believe they cannot take for granted that inflation expectations are tightly moored and worry that expanding asset purchases further could push inflation expectations upward also despite significant strides in developing reserve management tools the committee still might be unsure about their likely effectiveness  if so the committee might think that the risks entailed in a further increase of asset purchases and the associated expansion of the balance sheet and reserves could outweigh the potential benefits 
under alternative b the committee would leave unchanged at this meeting the amounts and timing of its largescale asset purchases as well as its target range for the federal funds rate the first paragraph of the announcement would set the stage for this decision by again noting that economic activity is picking up and by adding that the deterioration in labor markets is abating  in view of the continued advance in equity prices over the intermeeting period and further declines in various private borrowing rates the paragraph would note that financial markets have become more supportive of economic growth  the inflation paragraph would continue to mention that the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time  and the third paragraph would again indicate that the committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period 
the most significant change relative to the november statement would be the inclusion of the last paragraph  in september and november your statements noted that the federal reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and price stability  that followed your indications expressed since last december that the federal reserve would be using all available tools  with the lsaps scheduled to wind down over the next few months usage of many of the liquidity facilities dwindling or already at zero and authorizations for many of the facilities currently extending only through february 1 and apparently likely to expire at that time the committee will soon need to make some adjustment to the wide range sentence under alternative b that sentence would be dropped today and the committee and the board would indicate their anticipation that most of the federal reserves liquidity facilities will expire on february 1  this statement would reference the june announcement that indicated that should the recent improvements in market conditions continue the board and the fomc currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond february 1  the paragraph would indicate specifically that the amlf the cpff the pdcf and the tslf were likely to be closed on february 1  it would also note that the federal reserve would be working with its foreign central bank counterparties to wind down the temporary liquidity swap arrangements by february 1  it would further indicate that the federal reserve expected to scale back amounts provided under the taf and it would indicate that the anticipated expiration dates for the talf remain unchanged importantly the final sentence would note that the federal reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth 
market participants generally appear to expect that todays statement will encompass relatively few changes from novembers more or less along the lines of the first three paragraphs of this alternative  the inclusion of the fourth paragraph would probably come as a modest surprise and if anything it might suggest a slightly greater inclination to initiate policy firming than market participants expect  however given that most market participants appear to expect the facilities to close on february 1 given the retention of the key extended period language and given the maintenance of the existing lsap amounts it seems unlikely that the fourth paragraph would cause the statement to prompt any significant market reaction on net 
another option perhaps would be to separate the fourth paragraph from the committees monetary policy statement and publish it on a standalone basis sometime in the next few days  indeed over the past two years the federal reserve has generally issued announcements related to liquidity facilities separately from fomc statements  however that practice was driven importantly by the timing of decisions on liquidity facilities which did not necessarily align with fomc meetings  it was also driven by the need to coordinate statements with foreign central banks which generally made it impossible to release these announcements along with the fomcs policy statement  in the current situation we understand that foreign central banks do not feel the need to coordinate with a statement referencing the likely termination of the swap lines on february 1 so there would seem to be little need for delay on that score perhaps also arguing for inclusion in todays statement is the point that if the paragraph were to be released separately sometime in the next few days the announcement today would still need to be modified somehow to foreshadow that possibility and so not blindside market participants  that modification obviously would be noticed and suggest that something was afoot 
the committee could also couple this paragraph with alternative c page 4  under this alternative the committee would begin to reduce the degree of monetary policy stimulus at this meeting  the committee might be motivated to take this action now if it did not anticipate that economic slack would be providing much restraint on inflation and was concerned that a large amount of stimulus is in train and risks eventually driving inflation upward perhaps in part because of an effect on inflation expectations of the very large and growing federal reserve balance sheet  in providing the background for this action the first paragraph of the statement for alternative c would generally be similar to that for alternative b but it would not cite the list of factors restraining household spending or the continued cutback in business fixed investment  the second paragraph would note the committees expectation that inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability but it would base that expectation primarily on appropriate monetary policy adjustments rather than the substantial resource slack that is cited as an important factor under alternative b  the committee would retain for now its target range of 0 to  percent for the federal funds rate but it would indicate an expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant low levels rather than exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time rather than for an extended period  moreover in view of continued improvements in financial markets and the economic outlook the committee would indicate that it decided to cap its purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities at 11 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at 160 billion 
of course market participants do not appear to anticipate a statement along the lines of alternative c even without the final paragraph the adjustment of the forward guidance and the reduction in asset purchases would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and would suggest that the committee was preparing to begin to firm its policy stance relatively soon  as brian sack noted yesterday a 
desk survey indicated that most primary dealers believe that the committee will 
remove the extended period reference at least three meetings before commencing 
tightening so quite possibly market participants might see a shift to an expectation 
that rates would remain low only for some time as suggesting that the committee 
might begin to raise its target for the funds rate in the spring say at the march 
meeting  interest rates would likely jump markedly in response to this information 
prompting an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a drop in equity 
prices the inclusion of the fourth paragraph on closing the facilities would amplify 
the message that the federal reserve was now moving quickly toward a significant 
tightening of policy thank you mr chairman 

chairman bernanke thank you are there questions for brian no response okay if there are no questions lets begin our goround with president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b but i would like to emphasize something that ive said in the past  i continue to see a persuasive case for further policy easing we are far below maximum sustainable employment inflation is undesirably low and almost any version of the taylor rule as well as the bluebooks optimal policy simulation recommends a negative setting for the federal funds rate at the present time  we need to remind ourselves of this fact to counteract the very natural instinct to tighten policy as the economy recovers its true that if we had been free to lower the federal funds rate into negative territory it would probably be appropriate to start tightening in the nottoodistant future  but we were constrained on the way down by the zero bound and in the face of that bound systematic policy calls for us to hold the federal funds rate near zero for a long time to come 
alternative b includes a paragraph addressing our special liquidity facilities  i do not consider the proposed language very controversial with one exception  im concerned about phasing out talf support for newly issued cmbs  i think its too soon to announce the termination of that support  outside of cre lending financial conditions have improved considerably and its appropriate to allow the other facilities to expire as scheduled  the reaction should be minimal because few observers expect them to continue 
in contrast our decisions relating to the lsap programs are important from a policy perspective the question of whether or not to reinvest soma holdings as they mature is an aspect of a broader policy decision concerning these programs  i do see some advantage to allowing our agencyrelated holdings to run off  this is a mechanistic strategy but it creates a selfliquidating feature for our mbs portfolioan exit strategy that shrinks our holdings over time in a manner that will be predictable to markets minimizing the possibility of abrupt movements in yields that could result from further discretionary asset purchases or sales and ongoing market speculation about our plans 
im encouraged by the staff assessment that allowing our mbs holdings to run off is likely to raise mortgage rates by only a few basis points  if so i think the benefits of increased predictability and a welldefined exit strategy will likely outweigh the small albeit undesirable contractionary effects of permitting our mbs holdings to contract before we would ideally withdraw stimulus my bigger concern is that we just dont know what will happen to mbs spreads and mortgage rates as we wind down our purchases over the next several months  many market participants expect rates to spike up considerably  and if that happens when the economy is still very weak and the housing markets remain fragile i think we may need to resume purchases  
i agree with president bullard that its important to preserve the flexibility to tailor lsap purchases and sales to emerging economic and financial conditions the final line in paragraph 3 states that our purchases are conditional on evolving conditions and i consider that line to be more than mere boilerplate  we will need to take that proviso seriously during the next few meetings as we gain a better idea of how winding down our programs is affecting spreads and yields in the meantime its worth strategizing about whether there is any way for us to gear the pace of purchases or sales to evolving conditions without targeting a specific mortgage rate and without creating undue uncertainty and excess volatility in the markets 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  i too support alternative b the greenbook assumes no change in interest rates through 2010  that is consistent with my own view of appropriate monetary policy and is consistent with communicating that we expect to maintain very low rates for an extended period of time  if outcomes are similar to the greenbook forecast removing the extended period language is a topic best left for the second half of 2010   removal of that language is likely to set off a significant change in market interest rates  it will not be appropriate until private sector growth is on a sustainable path and labor markets have improved significantly 
in terms of exit strategy selling a portion of our holdings of mortgagebacked securities should not be done in 2010 if the economy unfolds as envisioned in the greenbook forecast  uncertainty about the amount and speed of sales of our very large holdings of mortgagebacked securities would almost surely drive up the risk premium required by private purchasers of mortgagebacked securities conversations with a variety of market participants in boston indicate that such sales are not anticipated and would be viewed as a signal that we wanted mortgage rates much higher with the potential to dramatically slow a housing sector just beginning to recover 
should the economy unfold as in the greenbook forecast with only gradual improvement in unemployment and the inflation rate well below 2 percent i do not believe that we will need to raise rates either through increasing the interest rate on reserves or removing reserves from the system until at least the end of next year  the risks to real side recovery remain significant and the costs of the downside risks outweigh the costs associated with any upside risks 
id like to follow up on the discussion yesterday on the primary credit rate  if we were to keep the extended period language and raise the primary credit rate in january it may send a confusing signal to the market  while we would likely want to raise the primary credit rate as we implement the term deposit facility i would prefer to raise the primary credit rate closer to the time we are implementing the facility and possibly in conjunction with removing the extended period language which i would hope would not be at the january meeting 
i also concur with president yellens comment on the talf  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman given the increasing signs that the economy is gaining momentum i think its important for this committee to consider language that begins to prepare the market for the possibility that we will need to begin reducing the degree of policy accommodation and our interventions in private markets sooner rather than later the time to change policy is not now but i do believe the time is getting closer  i think the language in alternative c does a better job of this than the language in b with the change in the forward guidance regarding the path of the funds rate substituting some time for an extended period of time  i also note that paragraph 3 in alternative c begins with the phrase at this meeting  i wasnt quite sure about the intent of that but my interpretation isand i have some sympathy with the viewthat this language does emphasize that things may change at some future meeting and it sort of keeps our options open that changes can come to pass 
my own view is that as economic growth picks up and becomes more sustainable real interest rates will rise  appetite for risk will increase and that will lead to a rise in the opportunity cost of the vast amount of excess reserves that sits in the system  the money multiplier will go up and those excess reserves will flow rapidly out into the economy as the opportunity cost gets higher and higher for banks to hold onto them  the combination of more sustained growth and a flow of excess reserves into the economy would mean that if we want to retain control over those excess reserves we will have to raise the policy rate  so as real growth picks up and becomes more sustainable our policy rates should rise with that  put another way we may lose control of all those excess reserves 
as ive discussed at earlier meetings i favor the inflation paragraph in alternative c primarily because it emphasizes the dependence of inflation on the stability of longerterm expectations and on policy adjustments that we will take to keep inflation levels consistent with price stability both on the positive and negative side of our target i like conveying this idea that it is monetary policy actions rather than structural features of the economy that influence inflation over the longer term  moreover i think that the language of paragraph 2 in alternative c will help stabilize and anchor expectations as it more strongly signals our commitment to maintain price stability  i think this can only help us in a period when the dispersion in inflation forecasts has widened and uncertainty has increased  as i said at our last meeting the dispersion of the forecasts for longterm inflation both in our spf survey and our livingston survey has widened noticeably and this should concern us 
i favor including the last paragraph of alternative b which is repeated in alternative c regarding the expiration of some of our facilities on february 1 for three reasons  first and most importantly i believe it is the right policy  the improvement of financial conditions over the past year has been swifter than some of us might have expected and financial conditions appear to be returning to normalcy  i see no compelling reason at this point to keep the facilities open beyond february second the market expects that these facilities are going to be wound down early next year so i dont think the paragraph would cause much of a market reaction and it should help reduce uncertainty around that expectation  third its becoming progressively harder to justify the existence of some of these liquidity programs as financial market conditions improve  i assume that the governors are going to have to take a decision soon about whether exigent and unusual circumstances continue to exist to justify the programs  in my view its becoming harder and harder to do that  my only comment is that its not clear why we shouldnt further reduce the size of taf auctions at this point  theyre still significantly undersubscribed and we havent been able to increase the rate there will likely be interactions with the term deposit facility as we mentioned yesterday  i suggest we reduce these auctions again to see if we cant get supply more in line with demand 
as to our discussion yesterday about increasing the penalty rate the discount rate ill repeat my plea on this  im sympathetic with president rosengren and repeat my plea that we not treat our exit tools in isolation  we need to treat them collectively and have a discussion in january about how all the pieces of our exit tools fit together with an eye toward what form of monetary policy framework well want to use after this exit strategy is over  that is we need to know not only where were going but also how all of these different tools fit together to get us there because there are a lot of interactions  its difficult to determine the appropriate exit strategy and optimal size of our balance sheet without knowing which alternative monetary policy implementation framework were headed towards and what our policy rate strategies will be thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota thank you mr chairman  in our november statement we committed to maintaining a target range of zero to 25 basis points for the fed funds rate as long as the economy continued to exhibit low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations i believe that those conditions are still in place and so i am happy to maintain the fed funds rate in that target range 
also for the reasons ably described by president plosser i support committing ourselves to plans for ending the liquidity facilities as is done in both alternatives b and c  i do not see the utility of our buying the extra 150 billion of agency mbs and 15 billion of agency debt in alternative b but i am willing to support the thrust of the alternative because our language in the november statement about the lsap signaled a strong commitment to those extra asset purchases 
with that said i am concerned that alternative b is so silent about our plans for the balance sheet beyond march i would recommend changing the last sentence of alternative b to read the committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets so thats basically changing from purchases to holdings  this change would communicate to the public that we may choose to reduce the balance sheet by failing to reinvest or by selling assets my own view is that we should begin such a reduction in the second quarter of 2010 at least by failing to reinvest and more desirably through additional sales 
why do i favor reducing the balance sheet  well first the benefits of our interventions in these markets have fallen greatly  i am convinced from evidence offered by the new york fed that the lsap had big benefits in late 2008 and early 2009 but during that period financial markets were functioning poorly  risk premia in particular markets became largely disconnected from one another  but as pages 12 and 13 of the bluebook emphasize these conditions have greatly ameliorated and investors can more readily substitute across various financial assets  in these circumstances reducing our positions will have a muted effect on yields the benefits therefore of our big balance sheet have been greatly reduced and our big balance sheet is not without cost  it confronts us with the low probability possibility of high inflation banks have 1 trillion of excess reserves  these reserves represent an inflation risk generated from potential changes in household expectations 
the logic here is simple  if households believe that the price level is about to rise they will demand more liquid deposits in order to make their transactions  one of the five memos for the inflation dynamics session were going to get is by simon potter and other coauthors and it indicates how increases in government debt can lead to exactly those kinds of changes in household beliefs given those changes banks can readily accommodate the extra demand for deposits because theyre holding so many excess reserves  the extra deposits in the hands of households become extra money chasing the same amount of goods which has the possibility of generating inflation in this way excess reserves are a vehicle for households expectations about inflation to become reality 
one way this chain of events could take place is for banks to make additional loans  however their doing so would mean that they would be significantly changing the risk composition of their portfolios  my own belief is that deposit creation would be fueled instead by households and firms selling banks relatively illiquid but relatively riskless securities like corporate bonds municipal bonds and treasuries  households and firms now own about 4 trillion in such securities which is enough to expand demand deposits by 600 percent  this expansion obviously an extreme case would put enormous pressure on the price level  id be the first to say that this inflationary chain is only a possibility and i agree with market assessments that it currently has a low probability of occurring  but one lesson i have taken away from the past five years is that our conduct of policy should take account of exactly these kinds of lowprobability adverse tail events 
the staff is currently exploring the use of reverse repos and term deposits  these facilities have potentially useful ways to accommodate transient reductions of excess reserves  in contrast asset sales are a more effective commitment to a permanent reduction in our balance sheet this difference means that at a minimum asset sales are a useful complement to term deposits or reverse repos as i say i would like to see shrinkage in our balance sheet beginning in the second quarter of 2010 but now i think its worthwhile for us to start to foreshadow that possibility by changing the language of alternative b as i have recommended to refer to holdings of securities as opposed to simply talking about purchases  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president fisher 
mr fisher well mr chairman on page 156 of the 177 pages of the last transcript i said my one suggestion which i dont think will carry the table is that we change the term extended period to for some time  mr chairman my one suggestion which i dont think will carry the table is that if we do change the term extended period we change it to for some time  im going to be a broken record on that but i know it will not carry the table 
heres the point  im against expanding the balance sheet  i take the comments just made by my predecessor commentator quite seriously  but i do believe that the language in alternative b is acceptable even without changing for an extended period 
i would note president rosengrens excellent point that we consider the treatment of the spread on primary credit and its juxtaposition against the extended period language  i actually was caught quite flatfooted by that discussion yesterdayunprepared for it  id like some time to think about commenting on it  id like to see where it is sequenced into our exit strategy  i understand the theoretical desire to rewiden that spread  i do worry about the signal its going to send by the way to small and community bankers  i dont quite understand the full composition of who accesses primary credit and i could see some interpreting it as  youre still biased towards the big guys who are more active in the fed funds market and penalizing smaller borrowers who may want to access the primary credit window  so id like more time and im a little bit concerned that were rushing that discussion particularly in the context of these broader things we have been talking about  so i would ask very much that we not rush this into the first week of january 
to sum up  against expansion of the balance sheet remain concerned about the phrase extended period because i think weve boxed ourselves in therewe didnt get much for it but its there 
the third paragraph is very good we did what we said we were going to do when it was necessary to do it and were done  we aim to complete these liquidity facilities and indeed we signaled that were on that road for asset purchases unless as president yellen points out it becomes necessary which i think we cover in the very last sentence to modify our plans in order to preserve financial stability and economic growth 
i have one other editorial suggestion in the first paragraph whether we use alternative b or c we talk about the housing sector  we talk about household spending  we talk about business still cutting back on fixed investment  and yet in your excellent summary of what we said we have one point that is not included in there which is the reluctance of businesses to expand overhead including payrolls my editorial suggestion would be at the end of the sentence that begins with businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment though at a slower pace they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales but remain reluctant to expand overhead including payrolls  i would insert that in either b or c it is nowhere else referenced in this statement and i think its a very important point 
chairman bernanke say it again please 
mr fisher yes sir with the sentence that reads businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment though at a slower pace they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  i would add but remain reluctant to expand overhead including payrolls this is what we heard at the table  you summarized it eloquently it is not in the statement and i think it should be  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke remain reluctant to expand overhead including payrolls 
mr fisher but remain reluctant to expand overhead comma including payrolls 
chairman bernanke okay thank you governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b  on the first two paragraphs i thought they nicely captured the slightly better outlook that we heard around the table but without changing the fundamental contours of the expansion that most of us expect  so i thought they were in pretty good shape on president fishers suggestion i think i would amend your suggestion in the following way  i think this would be okayit would be interesting to hear what other people think  businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment though at a slower pace and they remain reluctant to add to payrolls  i think this reference to overhead is a little confusing 
mr fisher well payrolls are a big part of overhead  so that would bebut i think we need to include that point 
mr kohn then they continue to make progress  i think we did hear that around the table and its not inconsistent with the notion that the deterioration of labor market is abating  so i think that would be all right 
on the third paragraph i agree with an awful lot of what president yellen said  i think were still in an unsatisfactory place with the outlook for income employment and inflation still suboptimal for the next several years even with a negative real federal funds rate in place  if we had a positive nominal federal funds rate id probably be arguing for some easing but we dont  i think theres uncertainty about the benefits of adding to our longerterm purchases and some costs to that as well so im not prepared to argue for that  so im fine with leaving that as we have it but i do think its important as president kocherlakota said that were looking at low rates of resource utilization for some time subdued inflation trendswe just had some confirmation of that this morningand stable inflation expectations so i feel very strongly that we need to retain the extended period language 
with every improvement in the economy and with the passage of time we get closer to the eventual time when well have to tighten policy but i think thats still some time away  i worry that the natural real rate could be very low for some time  the story were telling is one in which we have these headwinds as youve been saying mr chairman in bank credit and as they go away things kind of snap back and the policy rate can be normalized by historic standards under those circumstances 
my concern is that we came into this episode with not a very high real interest rate which seemed consistent with the economy producing at right around full employment and not much inflation pressure outside the commodity and petroleum sector  we have to replace a bunch of consumption  so presumably consumption as a proportion of gdp is going to be lower going forward financial services as a proportion of gdp are going to be lower going forward and residential construction as a proportion of gdp is going to be lower going forward  this is a much more balanced economy  but we need to crowd in investment and net exports to replace all that especially because i dont think any of us want to crowd in government to replace all of that on a permanent basis  thats not a sustainable situation  so i think the issue of when to begin normalization of the real federal funds rate and what thats going to look like is one in which i see a potential for a lot of softness for a long time to come  and i think its too early president kocherlakota to change the purchases to holdings  lets consider that as part of the late january meeting when we discuss the exit strategy 
on the last paragraph i am in favor of including itthe funding markets have returned to normal in most areas shortterm markets and banks are able to access funds without our help with people issuing commercial paper or accessing funding without our help  its not an entirely riskless thing to suspend these we dont know to what extent our being there as a backstop is providing the confidence to keep these markets going and all of this funding has occurred in the context of very reduced demands for funding  banks and corporations are shrinking their balance sheets when that turns around its not clear whats going to happen  so its not riskless but its worth taking the risk  i think we need to do that and wind up these facilities and see what happens 
securitization markets are a more difficult picture i think especially for the new issue cmbs as president yellen pointed out its still a troubled market  theres very little activity i did hear some mildly encouraging things from brian sack yesterday  its beginning to come back still i think we could stick with the current wording but as president yellen noted we should take that last sentence seriously if we get into the spring and the new issue cmbs market is still broken we could think about extending that i think and evaluate the situation then i think its a good idea to include this paragraph in the announcement  this is a collaborative effort between the board and the fomc  i think as long as the extended period language is still here people wont take it as an early exit signal but rather appropriately as a signal that we see the financial markets are working better and we dont need the unusual liquidity backups thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  i also support alternative b but with one change i would agree with president plosser that the inflation paragraph from alternative c is the more appropriate one  the inflation paragraph in alternative c says the following  longerterm inflation expectations have been stable and the committee expects that with appropriate monetary policy adjustments inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability  i think thats a better statement of what were up to here at the fomc  it takes ownership of the inflation outcomes which i think is appropriate for the committee and i also think that statement does not preclude any factors that might influence inflation  we look at many things  we look at all the indicators that we can both in the us and globally and the factors that might influence inflation  but it does claim responsibility that at the end of the day its up to us to maintain low and stable inflation 
future statements may have to reconsider what were saying about the federal funds rate  i think this is an issue that we need to think about  is the federal funds rate really the primary interest rate instrument going forward  i thought brian sacks report highlighted issues about federal funds rate control in the environment in the next few years maybe longer  it seems to me that might have implications for credibility and communication for the committee and so i think we need to think about that issue  in particular is the interest rate on reserves being viewed as the primary policy rate going forward and is that sensible and does that work in our models 
the next meeting will be an important one for thinking about how to play the asset purchase program going forward  we can discuss it in more detail at that time but as i said yesterday i would prefer that we think carefully about how to actively manage the return of the balance sheet both to normal levels as one concern and to an appropriate mix of assets as another concern with the very large size were going to have to do that over a period of years so we need a strategy about how were going to get there so that we dont have to make adjustments in any sudden fashion 
again as we all agree i think interest rates may remain near zero according to the greenbook over the next two years the committee needs a clear plan for how to react to incoming data during that period  otherwise whats going to happen is that at the end of the first quarter  were going to be perceived as going on hold and perhaps staying on hold for a long time but information is going to roll in about the performance of the economy  we may want to adjust policy during that period especially if the news is particularly strong or particularly weak which can easily happen according to the estimates of uncertainty around our forecast 
our asset purchase program has been considered successful according to staff analysis  we could use that program to adjust policy going forward as we remain at the nearzero policy rate i would see the asset purchase program as a substitute for the policy easing we would have undertaken had we been able to do so  it seems logical to me that we would gradually withdraw some of the policy accommodation coming from the assetpurchase program as the economy improves  that would substitute for tightening that we would not be willing to do with the rise in rates also we should stand ready to do more with the assetpurchase program should information on the economy come in weaker than expected  again as many have pointed out theres plenty of downside risk as well as upside risk  i think the former chairman of this committee said that uncertainty isnt just a fact of life its a defining feature of how we have to deal with policy 
i agree with president kocherlakotas suggestion on holdings in the third paragraph  i thought that was a good suggestion i support that i also support president fishers suggestion in paragraph 1 perhaps as modified by governor kohn but i thought that was a good point too  and i agree with the comments that have been made about the final paragraph  i support the final paragraph as written thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president hoenig 
mr hoenig thank you mr chairman  its an interesting meeting  the way im trying to think of the context is that economic circumstances obviously have changed  you and others have described them  you might think of this meeting as an inflection point where were beginning to think a little bit differently about how were doing monetary policy and how we might do it in the future  there are a couple of aspects to it  in this meeting were beginning to describe i guess more definitely our exit from the extraordinary facilities that weve engaged in  paragraph 4 walks us through that and i think thats a good thing  and i also would probably be in agreement as we move to january for the increase in the spread  with that i do agree with president plosser that we should also increase the minimum acceptable bid rate on the taf as we go forward to keep that in line  so that is kind of phase 1 of this   
phase 2 is the more difficult and thats the process of removing the highly accommodative policy and perhaps firming policy as we go forward  that of course will depend as many have said on a variety of economic circumstances  but thats always the case im very sensitive to the fact that unemployment will be very slow to come down over the next several quarters but i also would remind the committee that if we started today it would be a long time before monetary policy is brought back up to what most would consider a normal policy under normal circumstances as well  were going to have an accommodative policy for many quarters ahead even if we were to start removing some of it today and we shouldnt lose sight that  we need to be thinking about removing this accommodative policy and restoring our balance sheet as others have said to precrisis levels we need to do that in gingerly way of course but we also need to begin to prepare the markets for that 
im very concerned  i know how we need to be walking on eggshells i really do  but im very concerned about this extended period language when were near zero because it also provides a safe harbor for those who are going to engage and are in fact engaged in speculative activities around that and we encourage that and i think there is a price to pay at the other end of this so as i balance this out im not inclined to wordsmith things but i do have a slight preference for c for a couple of reasons  i think it does more forcefully respond to the fact that conditions have improved  it does allow us to scale back some of the purchases that in my opinion should be scaled back and it does change the language from extended period to some time  i think yes there would be some jitteriness in the market perhaps but at the same time it would set the stage for giving people some confidence that things are improving and that we are in fact anticipating and avoiding some of the mistakes of the past that we are duly being reminded of  so thats how i view it at this time  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b i think its premature to reduce stimulus and i support retaining the extended period language  my soundings of participants in the financial markets suggest that whether we like it or not this extended period language has become a fixation and it gives us little flexibility until we really are genuinely ready to signal that we are going to tighten the policy rate  so i dont see the benefits at this stage of coming off that language 
i also support the inclusion of the language in the final paragraph  i think this language is a useful reaffirmation of our intent and i see the inclusion of paragraph 4 as furthering a communications practice of clarifying various exit questions related to management of the balance sheet having said that if i understood president yellens suggestion i am sympathetic to the removal of the talf sentence if that was her suggestion because i see the commercial real estate problem going forward as possibly requiring continuing use of talf in support of the cmbs market 
perhaps it does not require comment but i will say i am comfortable with the desks recommendation of an interim policy pending further deliberation starting next month of not reinvesting proceeds of maturing mbs and agency securities  i also agree with the recommendation to wait on the decision regarding the treasurys portfolio  im comfortable with that because given the small amount of maturities in the near term i think these interim arrangements will have little effect on the markets interpretation of our policy direction i think its worth commenting on that because were planning next month to discuss the overall exit policy 
i see in january and possibly in subsequent meetings that the committee is going to have to take up a number of questions that are quite complex regarding exit implementationwhen to begin active shrinking of the balance sheet what tools to use and what proportion and what sequence or what combination and how much tactical adjustment is required in response to developments in the financial markets and the economy  these are going to be very challenging questions because there are so many policy variables at play and possible economic states that we will be dealing with  so i would have been proposing something like the chairmans suggestion let me just say that i welcome the january session and i hope we devote a significant period of time to it 
like president fisher i was a bit taken by surprise or flatfooted by the recommendation on the primary credit rate and i too would like to hear more discussion on that and i think president rosengren also commented that he had doubts regarding the timing of this and i share those doubts as well thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  i have some attraction for alternative c  i dont think we need to provide further stimulus over the next couple of months by buying more mbs if we had committed a couple of months ago to buying the amount listed in alternative c i dont think we would decide to increase that amount to match up with alternative b 
i think that president kocherlakota was very eloquent about the concerns about our balance sheet especially our strategy past march  i think mr sacks graphs showing the optionadjusted spread on mbs is stunning it shows that we have driven mbs spreads well below historic norms  and i think its worth keeping in mind that those historic norms already reflected an implicit subsidy due to the perceived status of the government sponsored enterprises as benefiting from a government guarantee  president kocherlakota pointed to the value of our asset purchases last fall and earlier this year in improving market function and the natural metric for that is spreads these spreads have not only restored market functioning if you take them as a serious indicator but we have gone beyond that and were subsidizing the housing market now i think we should look at our mbs strategy in terms of the composition of aggregate demand that we want to foster  do we want to tilt aggregate demand towards housing and away from other components  i understand the need to stabilize the housing market and we did that earlier this year the market was in freefall  prices were falling  that was cutting household net worth people were cutting back on consumption  they did not know where things were going 
but the market is broadly stabilized now  prices have pretty much stabilized at the national level though there is local price movement  granted there is a huge foreclosure overhang but the market is working through those foreclosures working through those workouts transferring those assets to productive hands  i dont see the need to drive mbs down further and i dont think as a longrun matter we want to be skewing demand towards housing construction its an easy fix for a weak economy  its easy to get those construction teams out there putting foundations in and putting up frames but if we havent built too much housing now i am not sure when in our history we ever have  having said all of that i do believe i can bring myself to support alternative b on the grounds that we already have made a commitment to purchase the full allotment at the next two meetings and perhaps not enough has changed since that decision two months ago 
one thing i like very much about alternatives b and c is the new final paragraph announcing the winding down of our presence  i think it will be interpreted as an all clear siren a signal of our view that the financial market crisis is more or less over and the conditions are no longer unusual and exigent  i think thats a good signal to send  i think it will contribute to a little more confidence at the margin in the recovery 
i believe we should let mortgagebacked securities roll off as they mature  i think that the primary credit rate is worth thinking about and studying but again like president fisher i was caught unawares by that issue and would like to go back and put some numbers down on paper about potential slopes of the yield curve and in the primary credit rate and think about what it means for the term deposit facility and our overall configuration  president plosser mentioned this as well 
the talf sentenceid like to see it remain the way it is  i still havent seen evidence that the cmbs market is remedially fixable quantities are low but it sure looks like fundamentals are troubled there 
holdings i think would be a useful change  i support president kocherlakotas suggestion that we reword our reference to our assets in terms of holdings 
i also support president bullards suggestion to move paragraph 2 of alternative c into paragraph 2 of alternative b although if we dont do that after todays discussion of inflation dynamics and output gaps we might want to think about replacing the phrase substantial resource slack with low marginal cost  laughter  but we can debate that later  that concludes my remarks 
chairman bernanke im sorry  im a little confused about what president kocherlakota said would you repeat your suggestion about holdings 
mr kocherlakota  yes sure the last sentence of paragraph 3 alternative bi want it to read the committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions of financial markets 
chairman bernanke okay a number of people have commented that they were flatfooted by the primary credit rate proposal  that was the warning to give you plenty of time to think about that in the context of all the other things we are looking at 
mr lacker well this is our last meeting before the board of directors meeting at which you want to suggest that we execute 
chairman bernanke  we will discuss 
mr hoenig just one 
chairman bernanke  we will discuss 
mr hoenig just need one to execute 
mr lacker i know 
mr hoenig so you dont have to 
vice chairman dudley wed like to have an input 
chairman bernanke having a recommendation available in case the committee decides at the next meeting to take a step does not mean that we have to take a step 
mr lacker i understand that 
chairman bernanke but i hear your concern  president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  i too support alternative b  i think the continued monetary policy accommodation is appropriate  the unemployment rate is at 10 percent and core inflation is below my guideline of 2 percent 
i agree with the economic markers that are listed in the paragraph on inflationthe rates will remain low for an extended period of time due to low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations and i do put substantial weight on all three of those 
i was fascinated to hear governor kohns discussion of real rates and how the natural real rate might be low for some period of time  that did stand in contrast to president plossers discussion about how policy really might need to chase the real rate up  as don discussed theres a need to replace consumption expenditures and other types of investment and i believe that inherent in charlies commentary he did not have that same type of need  really this is just resource slack finding its way into a real rate discussion  i think it bodes well for us to have a robust discussion of these issues and recognize that it finds its way into a number of different market indicators  i tend to side a little bit more with governor kohn on this for that reason 
although the unemployment rate is 10 percent and is expected to improve only slowly thats the bad sidei still believe that a funds rate at about zero plus our large balance sheet is about as much as we can do and as much as we should do  i heard presidents yellens very good point about how we need to be patientif wed instead been able to adjust policy in a more accommodative fashion then wed be able to rebound a little bit more quickly but because we cant do that this is a reminder that we need to be patient in this attitude i agree with that 
i do think that the firstorder effect of our largescale asset purchases last spring was a nonlinear change in confidence that changed the tone for the way the economy was going  i think its probably very hard to come up with meaningful stimulative effects out of that but at any rate i do believe that we will need to recalibrate policy in a number of ways in 2010 
i support the winding down of our lending facilities as stated in alternative b  i support generally redeeming the mbs and agency debt as they mature as a very light way to head towards getting our balance sheet in the right direction  i dont think that that will be a move thats too accelerated towards restrictive policy  and i support the continued preparations that you have described in thinking about our exit strategy  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  before beginning to shift the current stance on monetary policy i would like to see the economy on a more solid footing  therefore i support alternative b 
i am clearly in a minority  in fact i think i am the only person so far that was going to raise concerns about adding paragraph 4 to the alternative b language  i agree with the assessment that conditions in financial markets have been normalizing and i see great value in informing the public after this meeting about the termination of our special liquidity facilities but i am concerned that adding this paragraph to our statement today might imply that we are beginning to tighten the stance of policy  so i was going to suggest that we avoid any confusion at this point and issue a separate statement  but releasing two distinct statements doesnt seem practical and no one else has suggested it one suggestion i had was to add a word like separately in the beginning of paragraph 4 so it would read something like separately in light of the ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets et cetera 
but that said the only other comment i wanted to make is that just like many others i concur with president rosengrens comments around making changes to the primary credit rate  it would be helpful to have more discussion about that at our next meeting  and if we do make a change then coupling it with the introduction of the term deposit facility or other exit strategy communications would be preferable  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  four quick points  first i support alternative b with the fisherkohn amendment about the reluctance by businesses to add head count  while im sympathetic to the views president lacker described on the incremental net benefits of our mbs purchases which i have discussed for some time weve now said that we were going to do it and theres nothing that weve learned between the last meeting and this meeting that would cause me to say that now is the right time to say just kidding  so i think we should live up to what we said because it would be i think a confusing retrenchment to go back to a smaller purchase level even though as a first impression many months ago i would have been sympathetic to that view 
second i support ending the existing liquidity facilities and i guess im of the view that we shouldnt relegate that to a separate statement  we should make it a virtue  we put these facilities in place they did all that we expected them to do and probably more  theyve served their purpose it is time for them to move on and i think we shouldnt be sheepish about that  i take that last line as seriously i think as president yellen does  when we say that were prepared to modify i dont think thats boilerplate at all  i think that says were still very attentive to whats going on so with respect to talf or any other facilities we need to be more aggressive as the financial conditions and economic conditions warrant  i think were prepared to do so but i dont think we should shy away from that   
third on the question about the language around the purchases of securities id like to make two points on what president kocherlakota said  first i just like saying that kocherlakota  laughter by next meeting i will be able to say the whole name without  so thats my first highly valueadded point on the suggestion  my second is that i think we should think about how to describe this mix of redemptions and purchases  im not sure this is the right moment but i think he does spark a pretty interesting thought  and just one other word for consideration if we take this discussion up in january rather than choosing purchases or holdings i wonder whether portfolio is better portfolio takes into account that mix of what you might be adding and what you might be subtractingit has an allocation point associated with it so i dont know the perfect words but i think its an interesting discussion 
and finally i support brian sacks recommendation on the runoff of mbs as an interim solution i think it might be an interim solution that at least in my eyes lasts for more than this intermeeting period but at least for now i think thats a prudent idea  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you governor duke 
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i too support alternative b  i am worried that the backup in mortgage rates as the purchases wind down could be on the high side of projections primarily because im concerned about who might emerge as the substitute buyer  the treasury programs and the gses are approaching the point where they need to reduce their portfolio holdings  my conversations with bankers indicate that theyre completely unwilling to purchase mortgagebacked securities without knowing exactly whats going to happen with our purchases and with potential sales so considering president kocherlakotasi can say it too suggestion in that light i think we should talk a little bit about what we might do on sales and the composition of the portfolio  but i wonder if changing it without any further clarity on that might not cause even more concern over purchasing mbs 
second even if we find ourselves in a position where wed like to provide more stimulus its not clear to me that the last couple hundred billion reserves have really made an awful lot of difference at the same time if we resume purchasing the mortgagebacked securities it would make it even easier politically to push resolution of the gses even further into the future  and i firmly believe that the emergence of the gses from conservatorship just as many of the larger financial institutions are coming out of government assistance and determining what future they might have are going to be prerequisites for the restart of private mortgage markets  i dont see how housing markets return to normal without the full spectrum of housing finance 
third the role of talf in cmbsit seems to me that with the newly issued cmbs the first new deal that came to market was so conservatively underwritten and had so much investor protection in order to be able to qualify for talf that that was the very reason that it attracted the investor interest that it did  and i would hope that that process would actually be able to continue through the next six months and im uncertain that we could do more past june  so im not as worried about that one ending in june  and i fervently wish we had been able to do the same thing for residential mortgagebacked securities  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  i think the nature of this discussion so far has confirmed what i suspected coming into this meeting which is that were right on the cusp of starting to make hard decisions were not quite there yet but everybody is positioning themselves  and in that spirit i want to position myself  laughter  while supporting alternative b i want to draw a distinction between the substance of what i think we are doing with the actions indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of alternative b and the way in which were communicating it i have no problem with the first i do have some concerns with the second   
with respect to substance i think what we are saying in paragraph 4 is that we had a series of very special programs that were addressing blockages in credit markets that were instituted over the last year or so  the unusual blockages and the large dysfunctionality in credit markets has substantially though not totally abated  and under these circumstances we are winding down most and eventually all of these programs  second i think were saying that were wrapping up the largescale asset purchases that we announced in march  third were continuing obviously the zero interest rate policy  and fourth we havent made any decisions on exit as of yet so im fine with all of those 
on the language i think paragraph 1 captures well the consensus around the table with the richarddon amendment which i think would be very useful  let me jump to paragraph 4 because i think paragraph 4 does have the potential to surprise markets  i dont think the actions themselves will surprise marketsi think this is whats anticipated  but the fact of including it in this statement as sandy suggested a few minutes ago may be a surprise and will begin to or could begin to elicit a lot of speculation as to whether this is in fact the beginning of a staged already planned exit as all of you know the amount of speculation among market actors as to what the exit plan is with dates and quantities is very high right now  so the last sentence as kevin and others have suggested ought to be taken seriously by us and not be considered as boilerplate i have to say on the merits im quite comfortable with the winding down as anticipated with the possible exception of cmbs 
that brings me to paragraph 3  when brian madigan sent around the language last week i looked at it and for the reasons i have already indicated i was a little uncomfortable but i felt that it was okay i thought that the last sentence of paragraph 3 was on the verge of being anachronistic but wasnt quite there so that it could await the january meeting  brian sacks informative and admirably forthright briefing yesterday injected some doubt into my mind about that because of the anticipated runoff issue again its not that the anticipated runoff seemed illadvised as a substantive matter but i do have some concern about whats being communicated by allowing those runoffs to happen  will there now be a firm view in the markets that we are just going to let these things run off notwithstanding what may happen in the future if theres a fair chance that that will be the inference drawn then we would be faced if conditions deteriorate in the future with a decision that would be regarded as a significant change in policy a switching on and off of the lights as it were rather than turning the dimmer switch a little bit in one direction or another  for that reason i was actually somewhat attracted by narayanas suggestion 
mr kocherlakota thats another beautiful name  laughter 
mr tarullo even though obviously our policy inclinations are probably different i took narayanas suggestion to be a kind of general statement of the bullard doctrine which jim patiently repeats every six or seven weeks in this roomlaughterabout the need for flexibility depending on circumstances  i think that while i could live with waiting one more month or six or seven weeks to change that last sentence of paragraph 3 i have to confess to some uneasiness as to what were projecting to markets in staying with this sentence given the way i think that paragraph 4 and the slight changes of wording in paragraph 3 will be understood 
one final pointto jeffs point on mbsi have two reactions to that  one for reasons many people stated in the goround yesterday mortgage rates and residential housing could still be key to the path of recovery next year and thus may be important to affect or to observe the effects of one way or the other but secondly in the absence of conventional monetary policy easing possibilities because of the zero bound we found in march we had two choices  we had the agency mbs basically and then we had treasuries  and treasuries raise a whole different set of concerns about the possible interaction with fiscal policy and maybe even foreign exchange policy that i think a lot of people around the table wanted to avoid  so i think its not just about the mortgage credit markets even though to some degree it is about mortgage credit markets thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  im very happy to see that were going to have the discussion on sequencing in january  i think its going to be very very important to see if we can reach a consensus view on strategy and tactics  the market is definitely wondering what those strategy and tactics are going to be  until then i think it would be useful not to debate this too much in the press because i think that just creates confusion  i notice that in the primary dealer survey the communications score we got this time came down a bit and i think some of our discussion about asset sales versus no asset sales might have contributed to confusion on that front 
im not going to say where i stand right now on how to do the sequencing but i do want people to start thinking about two broad issues  one is the timing of asset sales and on that i think there are two major views  one starting with draining reserves and raising the shortterm rate with asset sales held in abeyance maybe used maybe not and two conducting asset sales first and then moving on to raising shortterm interest rates later  i think thats a really important thing that were going to have to sort out  the second broad issue is the sequencing of reservedraining operations versus the increase in the ioer rate  the market thinks that were going to drain a lot of reserves first and then raise the ioer rate but we may decide to do the reverse so i think we need to have a thorough discussion about that issue 
in terms of the statement i favor alternative b  im with pretty much everyone else  were withdrawing quite a bit of accommodation frankly as we taper off the assetpurchase programs and phase out most of the liquidity facilities over the next few months  we dont really know how important liquidity facilities are in terms of their backstop function so until we actually take them away were not really going to know exactly how much accommodation is being withdrawn 
i think the extended period language still works  i thought it was interesting that the primary dealer poll suggested that if you keep it in then its going to be at least three more meetings before the fed might tighten  obviously its actually four because you would take it out potentially at the next meeting and then there would be three more meetings after that  so that fits pretty well with the informal poll that i talked about at the last meeting where extended period in my view was at least six months  so im glad to see that the dealers are on the same page on that as i am 
as far as president kocherlakotas suggestion on holdings im uncomfortable with that  heres the reason why i understand what youre driving at that there is this question of redemptions  but holdings suggests a twosidedness that purchases does not  i think if you put holdings in there youre inadvertently going to raise the question of whether asset sales are now on the table in a much more assumed way than what we might want to imply there  so i think thats the problem with it  i understand the motivation but purchases is onesided holdings is not 
finally on the new issue of cmbs i know thats a decision for the board  i think that in the relatively near future the board does need to clarify with the market though whether thats going to be extended or not extended  theres a pretty long runway for people to develop that and bring it to market so i would say by late january or early february it would be useful to clarify whether thats going to go away or whether that is going to be extended beyond june 30  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  as usual it was a very informative and diverse discussion 
lets talk a bit very broadly were going to come back in january and talk a lot about tactics let me just address for a moment this broad question  is policy too easy or too tight at this juncture  you know there is a fairly substantial view out therepaul krugman and joe gagnon for example have expressed itthat by the taylor rule we are still several hundred basis points too tight that we should therefore be doing a lot more asset purchases  president yellen i think was alluding to that  so i think there is a respectable view which says that we should be looking to ease further rather than to be tightening  the reason i personally at least am not convinced that thats the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we can take at this point and effective easing in the markets is not at all clear  for example on the one hand mortgage rates are already extraordinarily lowits not clear that we can lower them much more  and there are certainly risks associated with substantial further expansion of asset purchases including destabilizing inflation expectations causing commodity prices to rise or causing the dollar to start to fall all of which could lead to a reaction which would be actually a net negative so while i see merit in the idea that we should in some sense be at an easier stance than we are i think we are in fact getting to the point where the connection between our tools and the state of the financial conditions is becoming much less clear 
that being said i have listened to president bullard now for three or four meetings and even i can begin to hear that after a while  laughter i think that we should not rule out additional purchases we might want to consider a program of modest purchases which could be varied and consider doing that in a way thats responsive to broad conditions and specifically to something that well learn a lot more about in the next few months namely what happens to the mortgage rate and the housing market after our purchases end  so i think thats something we want to keep in mind as we think about our broad strategy 
should we do less as an alternative i think its good for confidence and good for predictability for us to begin to normalize policy to begin to operate in a way that people are more familiar with  we are coming to the point where we can do that and i view this closing of some of these facilities as being an important step  i dont think that actually tightening policy is a good idea for the reasons i just said i think that the economy is still quite weak and that we should not at this point either tighten or strongly signal a tightening at this juncture   
the signaling is very important for example relative to president lackers and others suggestion about cutting back slightly on our purchases the 100 billion here and there is small change as far the magnitudes are concerned  president plosser is holding his forehead  laughter whats far more important in this context is the signaling  what are we saying are we saying therefore that we have decided to begin a process of tightening  i worry much more about the signals than i do about the actual purchases at this point and so i think we have to be very very careful 
i do think that what we are doing has been quite constructive  regarding these side risks of the dollar and excess speculation and so on while we have to monitor those carefully at the moment i think those things look as best we can tell to be all right  and therefore again given the state of the economy i dont think we should be actively signaling a tightening process at this point i would notedespite the commentary of the dealers about three meetings and so onthat in the previous forward guidance episode we changed the statement about considerable period and two meetings later we raised interest rates  i mean it was a meeting of intermediate language and then the next meeting we raised rates  so i dont think that were constrained to six months by any means 
so my general preference is alternative b with maintaining importantly the extended period language for the time being trying to minimize changes that would be viewed as premature signals either of tightening or ease and thats a very important aspect of the language but at the same time i think what we do want to signal is normalization as much as possible that we are exiting from extraordinary facilities where we can and that we hope that it will inspire confidence that we are moving towards more normal policy 
let me talk a little bit about some of the specifics that were raised in the language  i think there is a good bit of support for president fishers idea in paragraph 1 about staffing  i didnt focus on it today but in fact in last novembers statement the sentence businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment also said and staffing  we cut that phrase for this meetings statement  so it does seem appropriate to say that even though were not seeing further declines in employment were not seeing hiring either  so how does it go  businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment though at a slower place but remain reluctant to expand payrolls is that what we have 
mr kohn and i think you could say and 
chairman bernanke and remain reluctant to expand  is that the right word was suggested 
mr kohn add to payrolls 
chairman bernanke still cutting back on fixed investment though at a slower pace and remain reluctant to expand payroll  right 
mr fisher don you had the best words i think 
chairman bernanke what were your words don 
mr kohn i said add to payrolls 
chairman bernanke okay add to payrolls 
mr kohn yes 
chairman bernanke all right thats a little better   on the inflation sentence i think there should be a barrier to make changes  i understand that several people have preferences for the language in c  i think someplace where we might head at some point would be to combine those two  for example if we want to retain the reference to resource slackthis is just a suggestion for the future im not going to propose this right nowwe could say something like with substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longerterm inflation expectations stablethen the second part of the cthe committee expects that with appropriate monetary adjustments inflation will remain at levels consistent and so on so thats a direction we could consider  id note that one issue is that making that change today would constitute a change in our inflation forecast and i dont think it really has changed from inflation being subdued to being consistent with price stability  it seems that that would be a natural step to take when inflation risks and levels and forecasts seem closer to the 2 percent target so my recommendation based on less change is generally better would be not to make that change today but to recognize that going forward that reference to monetary policy actions and price stability would be perhaps a constructive direction 
regarding the third paragraph i appreciate the thrust of president kocherlakotas suggestion and i think we do have to think aboutagain as president bullard has suggested how we might do additional purchases and if so how we can do that in a way thats more responsive to incoming data  that being said i share the vice chairmans concern that switching to the word holdings at this point is going to be jumping the gun in the sense of being too strongly suggestive that we can adjust the portfolio either up or down  and we have not yet i think come to any kind of conclusion or agreement about how were going to deal with asset sales that is what priority or what order they would have  so im reluctant for that reason to do that but again this like governor warshs portfolio comment is a suggestion a direction that were going to want to go toward as we have greater clarity among ourselves about how we want to manage our balance sheet 
several people objected to paragraph 4 but i thought the consensus mostly was to include thatagain as a symbol of our exit  the one question i would put before the group would be the sentence on the talf  we could simply drop that sentence if there is interest in doing that brian would that be a lacuna that would be troubling  were not referring to some of our other actions or programs 
mr madigan i think that presumably would be interpreted simply as the federal reserve has nothing new to report for the talf 
chairman bernanke so for those who are concerned that paragraph 4 is too strong a signal or who are concerned specifically about cmbs that might help in that direction  president evans  
mr evans havent we already announced these dates tentatively 
chairman bernanke we have announced them 
mr evans i guess the question is the perception would be if you sort of ratify some dates but not the others is that a signal that 
chairman bernanke im just putting it forward for the groups consideration  the difference is that the language here anticipated expiration dates is a somewhat different sense from the previous announcement which was that its being extended to  there is some information there in terms of the likelihood of a continuation of this program but personally im fine either way 
mr fisher excuse me mr chairman i think janets point was that we not consider the last sentence boilerplate that we are serious about it and that we will adjust if needed  wasnt that your point 
mr lacker actually she was talking about paragraph 3 
ms yellen actually i was talking about paragraph 3  the same applies here  its just that the time for putting together these deals is so long that to wait until anything close to june to say the facility is still available is problematic 
chairman bernanke we take the point that the board needs to think about this very soon and one can argue that this language does not preclude obviously extensionsit says anticipated expiration datethe last sentence says prepared to modify and so on 
mr tarullo richard suggests a parenthetical saying this is not boilerplate this is 
mr fisher no no laughter to be accurate i would amend the last sentence to say the federal reserve is preparedhonest to god really and we mean itlaughterto modify these plans i would not be in favor of taking that penultimate sentence out mr chairman 
mr plosser i think we should not take it out because i think listing all the programs that weve done and omitting this one would be noticed and it might be noticed in a significant wayi think thats what president evans was saying  so unless we really intend to do something different i think it would be a mistake not to include it 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker my sense is that it would be interpreted that something is  
mr plosser somethings afoot right 
chairman bernanke all right under president fishers suggestion well put the last sentence in bold laughter  were noddingthis is worrisome here  laughter is that acceptable 
all right my proposal then is to make the change about hiring in the first paragraph and to make no additional changes to alternative b noting for the future that we will want to consider modification of paragraph 3 the description of our portfolio and that all of these things appropriately should be part of our discussion of strategy and tactics which we have promised and we now have to deliver for january 
president lockhart 
mr lockhart this may be too fine a point but i have a thought about the use of the phrase adding to payrolls in light of the increase of temporary workers i am wondering if the business community thinks when they add temps or they add contract workers they are adding to payrolls when what were trying to say is theyre not adding permanent hires which is the fine distinction 
mr fisher thats why i used the word overhead originally but i think its too fine a point 
chairman bernanke well of course in the november report even including temporary hires it was still a negative number 
mr lockhart right but we are getting anecdotal feedback that theres a sort of sequenceyou add hours then you add temps and then ultimately you add permanents  and we are getting anecdotal feedback that there has been a pickup in temporaries  i just raise it to make sure we are communicating what we want 
mr kohn i think it says remain reluctant so isnt that what weve said  its not as if theyre not doing it but theyre being very cautious about it so i think its okay 
mr lockhart fair enough 
chairman bernanke any other comments no response  all right brian are you prepared to read the changes 
mr madigan theres just one change mr chairman  my understanding is that were adding to the fourth sentence at the end of the first clause another clause so after the words slower pace we add comma and remain reluctant to add to payrolls and then semicolon there are no other changes to alternative b as it appears on page 3  also the committees vote will be covering the directive on page 8 of the handout 
chairman bernanke okay and we will have further discussion dealing with redemptions going forward  on that issue for example in my july wall street journal editorial about our exit strategy i explicitly noted what the redemption expectations were for the next couple of years i noted that between 100 and 200 billion a year would roll off and i included that as part of my description of how we would exit  so it isnt an entire surprise in that respect  
if there are no other questions were prepared to take a roll 
mr luecke as brian indicated this vote will cover the directive on page 8 of the handout and the statement on page 3 with the modifications that brian read chairman bernanke yes 
vice chairman dudley yes 
governor duke  yes 
president evans  yes 
governor kohn  yes 
president lacker  yes 
president lockhart  yes 
governor tarullo  yes 
governor warsh  yes 
president yellen   yes 

chairman bernanke thank you very much  why dont we take a 15minute coffee break and come back for the special presentation 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke let me call on jeff fuhrer who will introduce the special  topic jeff 
mr fuhrer thank you mr chairman  in thinking about how to introduce this topic this morning i was tempted to extend the titanic metaphor of yesterday afternoon were i to do that i might note that first officer wilcox and ensign sheets had left the committee in the middle of the frigid north atlantic clinging to flimsy life boats while the sharks of high unemployment and highly uncertain inflation circled hungrily fortunately the intrepid crew of the rms carpathia headed by officers michael dotsey from philadelphia mark wynne from dallas and jeff fuhrer from boston were steaming their way to extricate the committee from its rather precarious circumstances  however i chose not to extend that metaphor  laughter further in part because unlike batman who seems to have an endless supply of tools in his utility belt to take care of any circumstances that might arise in gotham city we dont actually have any such tools to extricate you from your predicament  so i will move on and leave that belabored metaphor alone 
in weighing the options for monetary policy in the coming years inflation plays a pivotal role if inflation stabilizes at its recent level and then rises gradually to the committees implicit goal while unemployment declines towards a rate consistent with full employment over the same horizon many will consider this an acceptable outcome  if on the other hand inflation continues to decline in the presence of elevated unemployment falling more significantly below the committees goal then the committees policy decisions could become much more complicated 
which of these outcomes materializes will depend on what determines inflation in the short run so what does determine inflation  in answering this question i am reminded of one of my favorite stories which involves sigmund freud and one of his graduate students and which is probably entirely apocryphal  the student was troubled about freuds theory that all dreams reflect wish fulfillment  she had a recurrent dream in which she murdered her young children and she found it impossible to believe that this dream reflected her wishes  when she posed this dilemma to freud he thought for a moment and replied but dont you see that your dream simply reflects your wish to disprove my theories  laughter 
like freud economists love to be clever and also like freud our deep and abiding love of our own theories may make it difficult for us to see their flaws  in considering the possible trajectory of inflation i believe we should contemplate the alternatives with unfreudlike humility  the fact is that we dont know what will happen to inflation  in recent years inflation has certainly fluctuated but it has been quite stable by the standards of the 1970s and 1980s  it appears to have been so far only modestly responsive to the significant declines in employment activity and labor costs and while shortrun inflation expectations have generally tracked shortrun movements in inflation some measures of longrun expectations have remained remarkably stable  as a consequence it is difficult to know whether inflation in this turbulent period will respond to economic conditions as it did in the turbulent 1970s and 1980s or instead remain placid in the wake of recent and ongoing upheaval taking on the imperturbable sphinxlike demeanor that was characteristic of inflation in the period that we now fondly remember as the great moderation  
our goal today then is not to provide evidence that irrefutably explains how inflation has behaved and where it must go but instead to impose a degree of rigor on the discussion to raise questions based on our best theoretical and empirical analysis and most importantly to spark a discussion among the principals at this table that will help us better understand each of our imperfect frameworks for thinking about inflation 
and in that regard i would just note that at breakfast this morning such a discussion started to emergea rather engaging interactive discussion about some of the issues that well talk about today  so im hoping that maybe some of that sense will spill over to the discussion this morning  now let me turn it over to mike dotsey who will make the first presentation 
mr dotsey4 footnote 4 the materials used by mr dotsey are appended to this transcript appendix 4 end footnote 4   thanks jeff  mr chairman and members of the committee our presentation summarizes two important concepts inflation persistence and output gaps these seemingly disparate concepts are linked through the phillips curve  we  argue that interpretations  of inflation persistence and output gaps derived from  phillips curve models are sensitive to assumptions made in estimating these models and assumptions made about the nature of shocks entering the models  unfortunately there is not always a sound basis for choosing among candidate assumptions  as a result basing policy discussions on measures of persistence or output gaps may not be productive 
our work shows that 1 observed inflation persistence may be the result of monetary policy choices and thus cannot be used to infer structural features of the economy 2 statistical measures of output gaps are not useful in formulating monetary policy and 3 theoretical measures of output gaps may in principle be helpful for guiding policy but in practice they are probably not 
let me turn my attention to my first topic inflation persistence  to investigate the potential sources of inflation persistence we used a simple sticky price model  in this model the new keynesian phillips curve accounts for deviations of inflation from average or trend inflation  in looking at inflation over the last 50 years it appears that inflation can be characterized as a process having a timevarying mean  thus how one models trend inflation has important implications for the structure of the model  if trend inflation is changing over time and is modeled as changing over time then the new keynesian phillips curve needs to account only for the deviations of inflation from a changing trend not for overall inflation  thus a new keynesian phillips curve estimated on deviations from trend inflation will predict less backwardlooking indexation or shock persistence  there will be fewer structural rigidities than if the trend is depicted as a constant 
to clarify the sources of inflation persistence consider the reducedform new keynesian phillips curve on page 3 of the handout  this equation indicates that there are several potential sources of inflation persistence  inflation can be persistent because marginal cost is persistent because markup shocks are persistent because prices are indexed to past inflation or because the inflation trend is itself persistent  it seems natural to interpret a timevarying inflation trend as the result of a drifting inflation target  
we estimate our simple model for two specifications of the inflation trend a specification with a fixed inflation target and a specification with an inflation target that follows a random walk  we find that allowing for a random walk inflation target reduces the overall contribution of indexation and markup shocks to inflation persistence further the random walk inflation target specification is statistically preferred to the constant target specification  
that finding implies that the persistence of inflation is to a large degree determined by policy  supporting this point is the observation that historically across countries inflation persistence depends on the monetary regime  in particular inflation persistence is lower in countries that are on a gold standard or where the central bank targets inflation the finding that inflation persistence is largely determined by monetary policy and that other sources of persistence are not very important implies that policy is fully capable of changing the behavior of inflation without generating large economic costs especially if inflation expectations are well anchored 
now let me turn to my second topic the usefulness of output gaps for conducting monetary policy we are going to conclude that they are not very useful  broadly speaking output gaps refer to the deviation of output from a level deemed to be desirable thus constructing an output gap requires one to take a stand on the desired level of output often referred to as potential output  there are two primary approaches to defining and measuring potential output  those based on statistical procedures and those based on explicit theoretical models  statistical measures of potential output are constructed either as smoothed measures of actual output or smoothed estimates of output derived from a production function 
a second approach to constructing potential output relies on estimated theoretical models where the behaviors of output and potential output depend on the structure of the economy and the exogenous shocks buffeting the economy  some features of the economys structure and some of the shocks hitting the economy may give rise to inefficient outcomes  for example monopolistic price setting and nominal rigidities introduce distortions in addition markup shocks introduce inefficient fluctuations  this suggests defining potential output as that output that could be obtained in the absence of distortions and inefficient shocks but including the effects of shocks that are classified as efficient  in simple versions of these models a monetary policy that minimizes the difference between actual output and the modelbased definition of potential output that is the modelbased output gap is welfare improving 
thus in principle modelbased output gaps may be useful for policy purposes  in contrast the statistical measures of the output gap are less useful for policy purposes because these measures need not be closely related to modelbased gaps  for example in figure 1 of the handout we consider a productivity increase in an economy with sticky nominal prices  with sticky prices output responds more sluggishly than it would if prices were flexible  because of this potential output rises by more than actual output and the theoretical output gap is negative  however if we were to graph a statistical measure of potential which is a smoothed version of actual output it would rise by less than actual output producing a positive output gap thus the modelbased output gap and the statisticalbased output gap would move in opposite directions and imply different monetary policy responses  this example illustrates why we think it unwise to base policy on statisticalbased gaps 
however at this stage of model development we are also uncomfortable with using modelbased gaps for policy purposes  first in more complicated models the output gap is no longer a sufficient statistic for evaluating the welfare implications of monetary policy moreover the models are still preliminary  in addition shocks play an important quantitative role in these models but the economic interpretation of many of these shocks is unclear 
while we have come to accept productivity shocks as structural we have not yet reached that comfort level with many of the new structural shocks coming out of new keynesian phillips curve models 
it is also of importance that different models may produce very different measures of the output gap in figure 2 we plot the output gaps from three representative models the blue line represents the output gap from our smallscale model the green line is the output gap from a mediumscale new keynesian phillips curve model developed by my colleague keith sill and the two red lines represent alternative output gaps from the boards largerscale edo model  it is abundantly clear that the output gaps from these different models are very different  we therefore are not confident that given the current state of knowledge one can rely on modelbased gaps as sufficient indicators for monetary policy 
on a more positive note we believe that the process of formulating and estimating a particular model can be quite useful for policy purposes  estimation can inform a policymaker about the shocks that the model suggests are impacting the economy  if the shocks have been correctly identified the model can be a useful guide to policy a general lesson from our models is that it is not enough to know that output is high or low relative to trend to conclude that output is high or low relative to potential rather one needs to know something about the shocks hitting the economy and the assumed structure of the economy  it seems more appropriate that policy discussions should proceed based on explicit discussion of these shocks rather than the implied gaps 
from this we conclude that the use of models in policy discussions is beneficial  also because we have no agreedupon model it is useful to consider the implications from a number of models and it is certainly not necessary that all the models be of the new keynesian variety it is only the careful consideration of a full range of imperfect models that enlightens and places discipline on policy discussions 
in that regard the chicago exercise falls into the class of exercises that we find productive they provide a detailed exposition of their model the various variables constructed using their model and the contribution of shocks to these constructs  this is consistent with the way we suggest policy discussions be conducted  we are however more skeptical of the specifics of their exercise  they find that their measure of potential output which conforms to our definition of potential helps explain another model construct that they call fundamental inflation  we dont think this is much of a surprise  fundamental inflation is the part of detrended inflation generated by efficient shocks in their model absent inefficiencies and is thus constructed similarly to the way they construct potential output  that strategy increases the chance that those two constructs will be correlated  however this correlation is not necessarily useful for policy purposes  in particular fundamental inflation is only weakly correlated with actual inflation implying that their model like most models doesnt provide a good structural explanation of inflation  therefore from an academic perspective their results are very interesting but from a policy perspective less so because knowing the chicago measure of potential output tells us very little about actual inflation  this is a key point of the philadelphiarichmond presentation  and now ill turn it over to mark 
mr wynne5 footnote 5 the materials used by mr wynne are appended to this transcript appendix 5 end footnote 5  thank you mike mr chairman and members of the committee in recent years a number of monetary policymakers have addressed the question of whether greater global economic integration or globalization has had a significant impact on inflation in the united states  one dimension of this integration is trade in goods and services and as figure 1 in your handout shows imports as a share of gdp have gone from just over 4 percent during the 1950s and 1960s to more than 18 percent at the most recent peak  while there appears to be broad agreement on the importance of globalization as a real phenomenonthat is as a phenomenon that affects the location and pattern of real economic activity along with relative prices and real factor returnsthere is less agreement on what globalization means for inflation dynamics and monetary policy in a country as large as the united states on the one hand there are those who argue that the gap concept that is now relevant for thinking about us inflation is a worldwide measure rather than a domestic one  on the other hand there are those who argue that with a flexible exchange rate regime the effect of foreign price developments on us inflation is minimal  
whether greater openness has implications for inflation over the medium  to longer term depends very much on how monetary policy responds to these developments  globalization does not alter the fact that at longer horizons inflation is ultimately determined by the actions of  monetary policymakers  our remarks this morning will focus on the socalled global slack hypothesis the notion that as a result of globalization the concept of slack that is most relevant for thinking about shortrun tradeoffs between inflation and real activity is global rather than local  we argue that the global slack hypothesis has analytical content even under a floating exchange rate regime in the context of at least one widely used framework for thinking about inflation dynamics in open economies and furthermore is consistent with what we see in the data the evidence is fragile to be sure but it suggests that the hypothesis cannot be dismissed outright 
in an open economy as can be seen in slide 5 of the handout the final consumption basket will consist of both domestically produced and foreign produced goods and consequently the overall rate of consumer price inflation will be a weighted average of the rates of increase of the prices of these goods  when price changes are infrequent and asynchronous the rate of change of the prices of domestically produced goods can be written as a function of the expected future rate of change of these prices and the real marginal costs of producing them  the rate of change of the prices of foreign produced goods sold in the domestic market can be written analogously 
substitution of these relationships into the domestic consumer price index then gives us a general expression for the open economy phillips curve  domestic cpi inflation is related to expected future domestic cpi inflation and a weighted average of domestic and foreign real marginal costs  by invoking additional assumptions about the labor markets and firms pricing behavior it is possible to rewrite the phillips curve in a more standard form in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps 
and here we need to consider two cases 
suppose that firms that engage in international trade set prices in their own currency and adjust them infrequently under what is referred to as producer currency pricing the law of one price holds and exchange rate passthrough is complete  in this case there is a relatively straightforward mapping from real marginal costs to output gaps that allows us to write the domestic phillips curve in terms of an average of the domestic and foreign output gaps as can be seen in slide 6 in the handout the foreign output gap matters not only as a proxy for foreign marginal costs and their effects through import prices but also because of its influence on domestic pricing decisions in fact theory suggests that domestic marginal costs and therefore domestic producer prices will in general depend on the foreign gap as well because a domestic firms export their products abroad so higher foreign demand will force them to pay higher domestic wages and b variations in the terms of trade will affect their domestic market share and consequently their domestic costs  likewise foreign marginal costs will depend on foreign as well as domestic output gaps 
what if instead firms that are engaged in international trade set prices in the currency of the market to which they are exporting which is arguably the case for most foreign firms selling in the united states  under what is referred to as local currency pricing the law of one price no longer holds and exchange rate passthrough is incomplete  however we can still derive an expression for domestic cpi inflation in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps but the phillips curve now includes an additional expression reflecting the impact of deviations from the law of one price on inflation dynamics  these deviations in turn can be tied to the easily observable real exchange rate net of terms of trade effects 
under both assumptions about pricing behavior the composite coefficients on the domestic and foreign output gaps are identical functions of the underlying structural parameters of the model  most importantly as we show in our background paper the coefficient on the domestic output gap declines as imported goods become more important in the consumption bundle while the coefficient on the foreign output gap increases that is as foreign goods become more important in the consumption bundle the strength of the relationship between the foreign output gap and domestic inflation will increase while the relationship between the domestic output gap and domestic inflation will become weaker 
turning now to slide 7 even prior to the recent flurry of work on globalization a number of federal reserve economists had looked into the potential effect of foreign slack on us inflation these earlier analyses generally found that the estimated coefficients on measures of foreign slack were not statistically significant in traditional backwardlooking phillips curve regressions  in these earlier studies the rest of the world was usually assumed to be the rest of the g7  borio and filardo revived the debate in a widely cited paper and they found a statistically significant role for the foreign output gap in explaining us inflation and a declining role for the domestic output gap  subsequent work by researchers at the board of governors however cast doubt on the robustness of these findings 
the new keynesian analytical framework that we use provides an account of inflation dynamics around a possibly timevarying steady state  hence when looking for patterns in the data it seems appropriate to focus on the cyclical components of the variables if we define the world as consisting of just the g7 economies as much of the older empirical literature had done ordinary least squares estimates of simple open economy phillips curve regressions suggest that there is a more significant relationship in a statistical sense between slack in the other economies of the g7 and the cyclical component of inflation in the us than there is between slack in the us and inflation in the us  but while the g7 group still accounts for a significant share of world gdp and of us imports these shares are declining as shown on slide 9 in your handout a more comprehensive empirical evaluation of the hypothesis would look at a larger group of countries  slide 10 in the handout reports some of the results we obtain estimating simple versions of our phillips curve specifications  for three of the four specifications the estimated coefficient on the foreign output gap is statistically significant at the 5 percent level and exceeds the estimated coefficient on the us output gap in magnitude  the evidence is far from overwhelming to be sure but it suggests that the idea is worth taking seriously and exploring further 
there are a number of possible reasons for the fragility of the evidence mostly having to do with the conceptual and measurement challenges associated with estimating phillips curves in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps  but we should note that it is possible to completely eliminate foreign slack variables from the phillips curve  that is the effects of foreign slack on domestic inflation can be fully captured in principle by movements in a termsoftrade gap  interestingly when written this way it turns out that the slope of the phillips curve with respect to domestic slack is exactly the same in the open economy and closed economy specifications of the model as can be seen in slide 11 in the handout  the equivalence between these two approaches to capturing the relationship between foreign slack and domestic inflation also means that much of the earlier empirical work on this issue including our own probably needs to be reconsidered 
to sum up there are sound analytical and empirical reasons for believing that globalizationand in particular the greater openness of the us economy to trade has had important implications for inflation dynamics  however there are wellknown conceptual and measurement issues associated with the use of output gaps  a  termsoftrade gap can in principle capture the effects of the foreign output gap on domestic inflation developments but it remains to be seen how well a global slack perspective can improve our ability to forecast inflation and understand the tradeoffs that monetary policy faces  jeff will now continue with the staff presentation  
mr fuhrer6 footnote 6 the materials used by mr fuhrer are appended to this transcript appendix 6 end footnote 6   ill be referring to the third of the three exhibits in your packets  i just wanted to note before starting that the work ill discuss reflects contributions from other people in the room today including giovanni olivei wilbert van der klaauw and todd clark as well as other economists who couldnt be with us today 
in current discussions regarding the likely trajectory of inflation two issues loom  large  first whether wellanchored expectations will help to restrain inflations decline and on the flip side whether an unanchoring of expectations could lead to an undesirably high rate of inflation and second whether and  to what extent output or more generally resource utilization gaps are useful components of empirical models of inflation and if they are to what extent current gaps will counterbalance the effects of expectations on inflation 
page three of your handout provides a skeletal depiction of the most widely used framework for modeling inflation  some version of this model is in use at virtually all reserve banks and the board in fact very little exists in the way of strongly competing frameworks  as the top left panel of the chart shows the framework suggests that inflation depends on the expectation of inflation in the next period the current value of a driving variable such as marginal cost of production or an output gap and the inherent inertia in inflation captured by dependence on the previous periods inflation rate many other factors can influence inflation directly and indirectly but these key elements sit at the center of the framework and of recent discussion the extent to which each of these three factors contributes to the evolution of inflation remains under considerable debate 
the top right panel of that chart highlights an implication of this simple framework  if the framework is true in the current period it holds in the next period as well if you squint at these two panels for just a few minutes and squint in just the right way youll see that the model boiled down implies that inflation fundamentally depends on current and expected output or marginal cost as noted in the bottom left  panel of the chart of course expectations of output depend in part on expectations of monetary policy  policy in turn depends on the inflation goal which in this framework may vary over time  as a consequence expectations of monetary policy actions and the monetary authoritys inflation goal are not surprisingly among the determinants of inflation 
the bottom right panel of that same exhibit displays the implications that this framework holds concerning which expectations measures should best explain inflation taken together the simplest features of the model in the top left panel and its implications in the next two panels suggest that shortterm inflation expectations matter directlyor equivalently that the expectations for output on average over the medium term matter directly  less directly but certainly importantly for this audience longrun inflation expectations should matter to the extent that they serve as proxies for the central banks longrun inflation goal 
what do anchored expectations mean in this framework your next exhibit the fourth exhibit suggests that anchored expectations should be interpreted as having two components  first the public knows the fomcs numerical inflation goal and second the public believes that goal is not likely to changeat least not by much  as indicated in the exhibit many believe that the feds inflation goal has changed quite significantly in postwar history particularly in the 1970s and 1980s  more recent evidence suggests that public perceptions of the feds goal have changed little in recent years as shown in your next exhibit exhibit 5 a carefully constructed econometric estimate of the inflation trendoften interpreted as the publics perception of the fomcs inflation goalsuggests that it has indeed varied over time and that the variation is well proxied by the median spf 10year cpi inflation forecast and that this proxy has been remarkably stable over the past 10 to 12 years  if this proxy accurately reflects the relevant expectations then they are currently wellanchored indeed 
we now use a model that incorporates all these featureswellanchored expectations some effect of output gaps or marginal cost on inflation and some effect of lagged inflationto quantify the extent to which in circumstances such as those we face today wellanchored expectations may serve to offset downward pressures on inflation from dramatic declines in marginal cost your next two exhibits consider such an exercise 
in the first case shown in exhibit 6 expectations are purely forwardlooking  the economy starts at a 2 percent inflation rate thats the black line in the top panel with marginal cost shown in the bottom panel well below its historical averageas is the case today for real unit labor costs for the nonfarm business sector which are about 8 to 10 percent below their longrun average  somewhat optimistically i assume that the output gap is only modestly negative  in these circumstances the inflation rate which is shown by the solid black line falls to a bit below 1 percent and rises after two to three years to the feds assumed inflation goal of 2 percent which is depicted by the red line 
in the second case which is shown in your next exhibit exhibit 7 inflation depends in roughly equal measure on lagged and expected inflation  the other features of the simulation are identical but the results in this case are dramatically different inflation falls significantly below zero and the funds rate the dashed black line is pinned at the zero lower bound for several quarters  i should emphasize that the coefficient on marginal cost in these simulations is quite small by historical standards the point is that one needs only a very small dependence on marginal cost to develop such results 
clearly the implications for inflation in this canonical framework depend critically on the way expectations are formedpurely forwardlooking or with some measure of backwardlooking influence  so which is a better description of inflation your next exhibit number 8 outlines an empirical approach to answering this question we estimate a model that allows expectations to be determined by any combination of the following measures the rational or modelconsistent expectations employed in the preceding simulations lagged inflation and short and longterm survey expectations here using the survey of professional forecasters measures  we allow the contributions of these four expectations proxies to vary over time 
your next exhibit exhibit 9 presents a simple summary of the results  on average over the past 30 years the purely forwardlooking expectations have played at most a modest role in explaining inflation and that role appears to have declined in importance in recent years  lagged inflation has played a somewhat larger role historically although its role has similarly declined in recent years  survey expectations have helped to explain inflation and their influence appears to have risen in recent years i would note that the survey measures are wellapproximated by slowmoving averages of recent inflation which suggests that they too may anchor inflation as they will lend a slowmoving component to it  while this might serve to slow the decline of inflation in the face of significant marginal cost pressure it will also slow inflation during its ascent to the feds inflation goal  the bottom line of this exercise is that the data suggest that the very favorable outcome in the purely forwardlooking exercise of exhibit 6 is not our best forecast 
your next several exhibits consider what would happen if the publics inflation expectations were to become unanchored note that the models that we used in the simulations just a moment ago require inflation ultimately to rise oneforone with an increase in longrun inflation expectations  interestingly estimates of a less structured empirical model shown in exhibit 11 yield the same basic result  a reasonable interpretation of that result is that when longrun expectations move significantly and persistently they likely reflect a change in the publics perception of our inflation goal such a shift if sustained would very likely feed into inflation over time 
your next exhibit number 12 considers a potential cause of such a shift in longrun expectations based on the same empirical model the exhibit examines the response of longrun expectations to a decline in core inflation  the figure suggests that over the past 25 years persistent deviations of core inflation from the feds inflation goal have engendered significant movements in longrun expectations  this exhibit highlights the risk that in the wake of declines in core inflation over the past year longrun expectations could also decline  together with persistently large output gaps and cost pressures declining longrun expectations could imply sizable declines in inflation of course the risk could play out in the opposite direction if expectations moved persistently higher 
another candidate for spurring such an expectations dynamic is the potential link between inflation expectations and the expected path of federal deficits  the new york fed conducted a set of surveys to elicit perceptions among consumers and financial experts about the association between future changes in government debt and inflation survey responses shown in exhibit 13a indicate that a majority of consumers perceive unexpected increases in government debt to be inflationary irrespective of whether unexpectedly high debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenues or higherthanexpected government spending in a followup survey the scenarios described in the exhibit were expanded by adding specific hypothetical causes for the increase in government spending and shortfall in tax revenues  these additions had no effect on the response patterns moreover they are robust across education income and financial literacy categories of consumers  
in contrast to consumers financial experts view the scenario in which higherthanexpected debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenueswhere a recession is the leading cause for such a scenarioas not inflationary with 6 out of 11 financial experts associating such conditions with a decline in inflation  however 10 out of 11 financial experts perceive the scenario in which there is higherthanexpected government spending to be inflationary 
having discussed some ways in which expectations could become unanchored we now attempt to quantify how unanchored expectations might affect our outlook for inflation exhibit 14 displays a simulation of the model we discussed earlier in exhibit 7 except in this case the public mistakenly believes the central banks inflation goal has risen to 3 percent the upward pressure that this places on inflation the black line is noticeableinflation does not decline as deeply as in the simulation with anchored expectations  the funds rate the black dashed line is pinned at the zero lower bound for a shorter time  but the feds actions and the course of inflation gradually persuade the public in this model at least that the feds goal is not 3 percent so the economy returns to its desired state of full employment with price stability even with unanchored expectations as characterized in this exercise very low costs and sizable slack at the onset of the simulation still imply a protracted period of low inflation 
all of the phillips curve models structural or reducedform oldfashioned or newfashioned hinge on the influence of an activity or cost variable  without the influence of such a variable these relationships are vacuous and inflation can be indeterminatethere is no channel for monetary policy to control inflation and as suggested in exhibit 3 the relevant expectations have nothing to anchor them  exhibits 15 and 16 examine the issue of whether activity gaps have been reliable inflation predictors much ink has been spilled over this issue so we are unlikely to 
provide a definitive answer there  but our empirical work corroborates the 
commonsense findings of jim stock and mark watson and that is that gaps matter 
when theyre large but less noticeably when they are small
 
the figure in exhibit 16 summarizes the evidence simply although it takes a 
second to orient yourself to it  using historical data from 1961 to 2009 the figure 
compares the absolute value of unemployment gaps on the vertical axis to the 
difference between forecast errors from a phillips curve and a naive statistical model 
of inflation that does not include the activity gap  the reduction in forecast error 
provided by incorporating an unemployment gap measure is insignificant when the 
unemployment gap is near zero toward the bottom of the chart  but as the 
magnitude of the gap increases the forecast error made by the gapaugmented model 
falls relative to the error from the naive model as indicated by the prevalence of blue
 diamonds to the left of the vertical axis in the upper half of the chart  this finding is 
consistent with the small estimated coefficients on output gaps in phillips curves for 
the 1990s and early 2000s and explains the finding in some prior research that during 
those relatively calm times the naive model predicts inflation about as well as or 
better than a gapdependent forecasting model this is less likely to be the case in 
current circumstances 

what does this empirical finding imply for the current inflation forecast  your next exhibit number 17 shows that a model that incorporates this nonlinearity explains the past several years inflation data quite well however the surge in unemployment over the past year implies a significant decline in inflation to near zero over the next year or so thus the next several quarters will provide an important test of this model 
finally we would be remiss if we altogether ignored money in a discussion of 
inflation dynamics your final exhibit which is courtesy of the minneapolis fed 
displays the correlations between money growth and inflation at progressively longer 
horizons from left to right while these correlations do not show causality many 
would agree that over long periods of time high growth in money is likely to be 
accompanied by high inflation  because such correlations are essentially
 contemporaneous they also do not imply that money can be used to predict future 
inflation as the exhibit suggests milton friedman may now rest in peace 

that concludes our prepared remarks  wed be happy to take questions 
chairman bernanke first let me thank the staff for an outstanding effort in putting this all together and indeed coordinating among different reserve banks  we now have an opportunity for questions or comments  let me start with a question for you mike  you talk about statistical models of gaps but i think they look to be mostly constructed from single variable analysis looking only at gdp  take your example with the productivity shockif you also looked at say productivity or unemployment and so on you would get more information and you might be able to identify the shock in that case  so wouldnt a multivariable analysis reduce some of your concern about statistical models 
mr dotsey i really cant answer that i havent done that research and i havent looked into that i dont know if andreas whos also with me today has anything he could add 
mr hornstein the short answer to be honest is yes  for this particular example the way its structured you rely on price rigidities  so with a productivity increase output is not going to move so much and employment contracts  a particular example would predict that if you look at more information you might reassess what you think about the gap  on the other hand the way these gaps are usually constructed you generate the trend output pathyou dont use that kind of information 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker mr chairman if you take the model as a maintained assumption it tells you how to calculate the gap and you do use all those variables  so when they talk about model generated gaps thats exactly what theyre talking about  i think the difficulty arises as their memo and the chicago one illustrate in that different models give you different estimates of the gap and different estimates of how productivity shocks affect what you regard as 
chairman bernanke i thought the point was if you look at just the path of gdp and you took a quadratic trend or something out of that and looked at residuals the gaps you would construct that way would not be necessarily economically meaningful for reasons we understand 
mr lacker in a statistical atheoretical model  right 
chairman bernanke but if you believed in their model then productivity and unemployment data would help you identify gaps in their modelwhich is not a bizarre model its similar to a lot of others

mr kocherlakota thanks mr chairman  i was impressed with all of the papers it was obvious that a lot of work went into them and im very appreciative of that 
i wanted to talk about two messages i took away from the philadelphiarichmond paper  its more commentary than questions  one is the discussion that president lacker and chairman bernanke were just having about the difference between old thinking and new thinking or old keynesian and new keynesian models about gaps  i think this difference is that just looking at a statistical trend as a way to figure out what potential output is or efficient output is can be misleading  just to cite the current example output right now is about 8 percent below trend as measured from december 2007  the question is how much of this fall is efficient  how much of this represents a deviation from potential output  the theme that comes out of the philadelphiarichmond paperand its basically a theme of all work on monetary economics for the last 15 yearsis that theres really no way to answer this question without a model 
the second message that comes out of this paper is that measuring an output gap can be hard i think that at times the paper or the presentation seems to imply that this is somehow a new problem with new keynesian modeling when in fact its pretty much an old problem which is true in all economicswe can come up with observationally equivalent models that in this case will give rise to different measures of output gaps and then different implications of optimal policy  i think the chicago paper points this outthat this is not something special to the new keynesian approach to thinking about monetary economics but rather its something thats present in all macroeconomic models 
in fact i think the new keynesian approach actually helps us with thinking about sorting across models because it brings so much more auxiliary information to bear compared to older approaches for example it requires consistency between householdlevel and firmlevel expectations and observed data and theres consistency between asset pricing and firm investment decisions  all of these kinds of restrictions are valuable sources of information that make it easier to use data to distinguish among existing models  the point is that i think the philadelphiarichmond paper is right that these newer models dont fully solve this identification problemwhat are output gaps whats the right thing to do at any given moment in time 
i think there are two parts to trying to respond to this problem one is that we use a wide range of models and this is something you see in the bluebookseveral models are considered  we might even think of expanding that range of models  and then theres supplementing that with good judgment which is what the chicago memo i think is trying to argue that is if we bring enough good judgment to bear we can actually sort through some of these issues  that can be very helpful 
the second part which is something thats more common in other parts of macroeconomics is to use microdata as an auxiliary source of information beyond macrodata  the edo model which is used at the board is one step in this direction because it uses sector level data but there are lots of other kinds of microlevel data that can be very informative  for example theres this issue about whether or not inflation is backwardlooking that is for example whether when firms set prices they look backwards or not in terms of indexation  well we have lots of microdata on price setting mark bills at the university of rochester and pete klenow at stanford university have basically spent the last decade on this issue  the ecb has commissioned studies in a wide range of countries to do this in europe  it would be great to supplement some of our thinking about just building aggregatelevel models with information from microlevel data  likewise a lot of times the questions hinge on these latent or unobservable things in the macro model which we could actually try to get information about from microlevel data for example questions about firm financing costs questions about the marginal efficiency of investment  there can be uses for microlevel data to try to supplement whats in the macro models 
so by and large i like the philadelphiarichmond paper and presentation but i think they came across as far too negative about the state of play  i think that weve made enormous progress in the last ten years in bringing models to bear that are useful for policy analysis while at the same time they embed the ingredients of modern macroeconomics that have been proven useful in other contexts 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans theres not a long list of people already 
chairman bernanke no youre next 
mr evans all right  im a little reluctant to intervene so early because i have a series of rants that i could go on laughter and i apologize for that 
regarding your question mr chairman i think you put your finger on one of the things that bothered me  but first off i thought this was a terrific set of papers and theyre very helpful as we think about these issues  i think the papers expose a number of committee members to a different type of discussion one that economists tend to have which you may or may not like but at any rate this is what we do 
i thought the philadelphiarichmond critique of statistical gap measures and new keynesian models was just a little too mechanical and didnt represent how we actually use these measures in this room  they had the example of a beneficial productivity shock and a stickyprice model if everybody followed that their analysis says that after a positive productivity shock well get a positive statistical output gap  well see that output goes up but the trend is going to be smoother and so its positive while in fact what is actually taking place is that potential is a lot higher and output only went up by this much  so its a negative type of gap and if all were looking at is the output gap as mike properly noted were going to mechanically make a mistake 
but the question is have we ever gone through this  we have  the greenspan fed lived through this during the second half of the 1990s  the debate between irrational exuberance and a onceinageneration productivity acceleration was squarely put on the table in those discussions and in the end the productivity argument carried the day and policy did not erroneously tighten how did we end up there  well chairman greenspan and the committee dismissed looking only at single measures  im sorry dave stockton isnt here because that was very uncomfortable as chairman greenspan would say phillips curveno no no we dont want to look at that capacity no no no and nobody could quite figure out exactly which resource slack measure he wanted to look at but he was looking at resource slack  he used other information beyond the comparison of actual output with a simple trend  so if we think about the productivity shock example in the philadelphiarichmond memo in a stickyprice model because output cannot expand to potential labor input is going to fall  this comes out of all the model simulations  ellen mcgrattan has papers where you see that from this type of shock  so labor slack is negative 
what about inflation signals  a positive statistical gap relative to a linear trend would call for upward price pressure so wed be worried about inflation picking up but in fact in the model the true output gap is negative and theres downward pressure on inflation because marginal costs are lower  so indeed in the second half of the 1990s we saw a good deal of such downward cost factors we were paying attention and we did not get caught up in just this single output gap measure  fundamentally we scratch our heads when we have different measures that dont line up  thats a realtime warning and we try to reconcile these conflicting signals we look at our models and our assumptions more closely  just think about how the greenbook gives us a good view on structural productivityeach greenbook which is more often than we really need it because it doesnt change that muchbut still thats quite good  and then theres other anecdotal information  chairman greenspan kept sayingand i know i didnt understand it when he first said itthat we heard plenty of business reports of higher productivity and earnings analysts fiveyearahead forecast smoothed were telling us something and that turned out to be right so the bottom line is that we lived through an example thats like the most troubling example in the paper and i think we passed it  so that was pretty good 
chairman bernanke i guess it was a productivity episode also in the jobless recovery after 2001 where we saw unemployment high relative to outputsomewhat similar 
president lacker 
mr lacker thank you i just want to sketch out how i see these presentations related to past discussions weve had as president evans did  ive often sensed some intuitive hurdles to consensus here at this end of the table some participants have argued that you ought to think of the gap differently from the unemployment rate relative to 5 percent or so  that intuitionthat the gap has to be really big right now with unemployment at 10 percent comes from this earlier way of thinking about macroeconomics that president kocherlakota referred to  we had macroeconomic models that were essentially static the static part isnt important for this purpose but they werent growth models and they were grafted on a deterministic growth model and the idea was that the deterministic growth model gave you a benchmark of what output and activity could be and what inflation could be and then macroeconomics was about deviations from a deterministic growth model 
we faced that and there was this challenge of integrating the two  we didnt know how and we know how now the way we integrate growth and fluctuations is the stochastic growth model and that provides an internally consistent coherent understanding of the determinants of growth and fluctuations so we dont need to rely on this ad hoc marrying of two different disparate models 
when i think about gaps i always want to start from scratch  i want to say all right lets take a model and lets pretend you dont know what a gap is or you dont know how a gap is defined lets look at inflation dynamics  does the difference between output and some other counterfactual output appear in that equation  and lets look at optimal policy and does the difference between output and some other counterfactual output appear in optimal policy 
when you do that in these stochastic growth models what you get is the counterfactual with which you should compare output to figure out what inflation is going to do and what policy should be its something that responds to shocks  thats the basic lesson i get out of this class of models that mike dotsey was talking about unlike the deterministic growth model where the benchmark counterfactual output everyone was thinking about is something that because it comes from the deterministic growth model does not respond to shocks so you can estimate it easily with an exponential function of time into a smooth statistical trend 
the thing to remember here is that its marginal cost and its just this use of production functions to get to an output gap that gives us the ability to write these modern inflation dynamic models in terms of output gapshence my facetious suggestion to substitute real marginal cost for resource slack in the statement  another way to look at this intuition is to think about a 6 percent unemployment rate in january of 2010  that seems preposterously unlikely  it seems that it would be really hard for us to engineer policy coming out of this meeting to get that  but if youre having trouble understanding an output gap or a potential that moves down a lot in a recession think about why you dont think we could achieve a 6 percent unemployment rate in the first quarter it would be really costly to employ all of those resources  its that the marginal cost is kind of high nowits not as low as you would think by just looking at the gap  thats the intuition i think for this other way of thinking about what counterfactual level of output or activity ought to be your reference in thinking about inflation dynamics 
i want to say a word building on what president kocherlakota observed about the use of models in policy dotsey et al conclude that these models are not quite ready for use in policy and id qualify that to paraphrase churchill theyre not quite ready for policy except that all other models are less ready for policy than these models are  i think its fair to say that this broad class of models is the only game in town now  what most people have said is that further approximations to reality are all going to be extensions of elaborations of this broad class of models where there is price setting with price stickiness and thats where the real nominal interaction comes from 
within a model you can answer these things really tightly  so youve got to step back and look at a range of plausible models that as president kocherlakota points out fit the data roughly equally well and decide what to do if you dont look at models youre still using a model because youve got an implicit model in your head  its kind of like axiomatic choice theory right  youre acting as if you have a model in your head if youre making a choice  being explicit about which models you understand and youre relying on seems obviously preferable to an approach where you dont formalize those things and dont tie down your insights or your intuition with the kind of internal coherence that president kocherlakota described 
ill make a final point  except for the case of purely backwardlooking inflation expectations the models depict us as in an equilibrium in which we are following have always followed and will always continue to follow a fixed rule a fixed mapping from economic circumstances to what we choose  maybe theres some drift in it over time but thats the basic framework so at all times youve got to look at a gap  but then what does it tell you about policy  what does it tell you about what its going to take to follow through on that rule in order to maintain the consistency of inflation expectations with what you would like to see maintained  thats a key question sometimes the gap doesnt say as much about that  sometimes i sense a large gap being adduced as evidence that we can pause for a long time and its not obvious that thats the case  its not obvious that our policy rule doesnt build in a different response so thats just my effort to tie this back to discussions weve had around this table i compliment the authors  i learned something from all three of them and im grateful for their efforts 
chairman bernanke president lacker the only thing that puzzles me in what you said is the implication that we dont use models  we do use models 
mr lacker we do 
chairman bernanke and alternative models  the staff uses both large macro models that try to deal with aggregation and complexity and they use smaller models  i think as you say theres only one model in town  i dont think you can write down a keynesian model that doesnt have a role for gaps in it 
mr lacker i didnt mean to imply that you or the board staff dont use models 
chairman bernanke okay 
mr evans could i make a comment 
chairman bernanke president evans has a twohander 
mr evans this is a line of commentary that i dont always follow that the gap is somehow a special variable an endogenous variable  in the context of writing down an equilibrium model you could writeim pretty sure this is truethe equilibrium decision rules which are a function of the relevant state variables which could be transformed so that the output gap captures that part of it  that would say that given our policy response function parameters this is how everything responds to the gap and were following through on it  so it requires art to know how we should be responding to those things but its not prima facie wrong 
mr lacker im not sure what youre saying 
mr evans when we say the output gap looks like this and so i think that policy ought to respond in this fashion because disinflationary forces are going to change things a little bit theres nothing in that that is in principle against the model and were the central bank in the middle of that model 
mr lacker yes 
mr evans okay then i didnt understand your comment about when we talk about output gaps 
chairman bernanke president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  i want first to thank the authors and presenters for raising a host of important issues about inflation dynamics  uncertainty about the longerrun inflation outlook is quite high right now and the extent of disagreement among forecasters is quite large  even so as i read the papers i was asking myself if there were some morals here for current policy  i identified three that emerged from the staff contributions and the broader literature and i just wanted to take a minute to highlight what i thought the policy conclusions are 
first the papers and broader literature suggest a very strong theoretical rationale and i see significant empirical evidence for the view that the level of economic activity matters to inflation the general principle that very low levels of economic activitywhether theyre measured by marginal costs as they are in the new keynesian model or by output gaps capacity utilization or unemploymentcause inflation to fall is a common thread across a broad set of macro models used for monetary policy analysis  as jeff fuhrer noted without some connection between real activity and inflation these models just have no linkage between monetary policy and inflation as jeff noted models with slack fit the inflation data reasonably well and over the past year phillips curve type models do a pretty good job of explaining the decline weve seen in core inflation this is a point that i made and president evans made as well a couple of meetings ago  going forward with marginal costs obviously very depressed and considerable slack in evidence by any measure these models predict continuing downward pressure on inflation 
a second clear policy takeaway from the literature and presentations is that without question inflation expectations are an important determinant of inflation  and as with slack there is considerable uncertainty about how to measure those expectations and about what forecast horizon is relevant  but in the current situation a wide range of inflation expectations has been holding fairly steady and i think the presentations suggest that wellanchored inflation expectations should help to counter the disinflationary pressures arising from very low levels of economic activity over the next couple of years  this is something that makes me less worried that i otherwise would be about outright deflationary outcomes 
the third policy conclusion to my mind is the one i want to emphasize the most  there is obviously a great deal of uncertainty about the exact nature of the inflation process and i conclude that thats something we have to take account of as we formulate monetary policy  theres a large literature on optimal monetary policy under uncertainty and it lays out several key principles 
the first is that there are relatively simple policies and taylortype rules are a class of them an excellent example  these policies are robust in the sense that they work well across a range of different models and degrees of difficulty in measuring gaps and there is a very large literature documenting this  as we know the policy choices of this committee have come reasonably close to the predictions of some variant of the taylor rule for the last several decades and as the bluebook indicates most variants of taylortype rules currently indicate as i said before that the funds rate should stay near zero for a long time 
a second principle of optimal policy under uncertainty is that policy should be formulated to guard against particularly undesirable outcomes and this principle to my mind suggests we should stay at the zero bound for an extended period because we can easily raise rates but its hard to lower them 
a third principle is that policy responses to different economic indicators should depend on the quality of the signals they are sending about the state of the economy  and in the current situation the level of unemployment and the degree of slack in the labor market that we see is so enormously large by every measure that it is sending a strong signal now and thats something that we should be responding to 
chairman bernanke thank you governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i had a question rather than a comment and its for mike i had trouble understanding the paragraph or two that you had in your paper about the current situation i guess you say we shouldnt be sitting around this table talking about gaps  so what should we have been talking about this morning  and within this model how do you explain what has happened over the last two years  weve had an enormous drop in output and a significant decline in inflation so how would you have designed this mornings discussion if you had had an opportunity 
mr dotsey i dont know if i can tell you exactly whats going on in the economy today thats a little bit of a hard road to walk down  but with regard to your first point if i were sitting at this table i would find the discussion among charlie and narayana and jeff very productive charlie could have had his entire discussion without mentioning the word gap once basically he was talking about what kind of shocks he thinks are hitting the economy given an underlying model based on i guess some of his own work and things like that  what kind of impact would those shocks have on the economy and then what should monetary policys actual response be  that i find extremely valuable in my own thinking and thats the way i think about policy 
the gap construct is something that as charlie commented is going to be model specific but i find that when people rely on that too much without doing the hard work which people have done around here in this discussion of talking about what are the beneficial models that help us understand things and the disagreements we might have over them in terms of identifying whats going on then that can sometimes lead away from a productive discussion  so i dont know what you talked about this morning but if you 
mr kohn so within the confines of the model what happened over the last two years  how did we get where we are and what are the implications of that for policy 
mr dotsey its unfortunate for the new keynesian models that at this point it seems that what we had was a large financial meltdown  what we do not have yet but which is part of the big research agenda thats just taking off is a way to integrate the way we think about financial markets and their role in the economy  so if i were trying to do things now i might say im going to go look at bernanke and gertler and gilchrist or im going to look at kiyotake and moore or maybe models like diamond and rajan and i might even pull away from the new keynesian paradigm and try to understand what theyre telling us is going on in the economy and then try to figure out a response so i think theres no getting around it as jeff lacker saysweve got to put our models on the table see where they fit things and then figure stuff out imperfectly  and in that discussion if you want to use gaps and you find them helpful thats fine and they may be a good communication device as well  but i dont think theyre essential  theyre an artificially constructed device that you can just sort of think about or not 
chairman bernanke a twohander from president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota but the model is trying to account for all variability in the data so its going to say something about the answer to governor kohns question about what has happened what is the model going to say  some shock has taken place according to the model what is the shock that has happened in the last two years or what is the constellation of two or three shocks that have happened in the last two years 
mr dotsey i would be no more informative on that than anybody here  but one could say that one of the things that has happened in financial markets is that capital is not being allocated efficiently across the economy that is the firms that might be getting the capital in normal times maybe smaller productive firms are not getting it and some larger nonproductive firms perhaps because they have better balance sheets or have been around are getting it and that would look like a technology shock 
but then again maybe were in a world where we have ambiguity aversion in our model and all of a sudden people have become very very uncertain about things or demanding large risk premiums and as a result investment isnt being done because its being priced in a crazy way 
mr kocherlakota but in the philadelphia model that you use 
mr dotsey in the philadelphia model where this is being soaked up as an inefficient investment shock that tells you that potential is going down a lot as well as output 
mr kocherlakota right 
mr dotsey im a little bit uncomfortable with that as the explanation but thats what that particular new keynesian model would say  im trying to remember i think the model at chicago also has a big role for some of these investmenttype technology shocks as well and whether they are  
mr evans i would guess it does 
mr kohn how would it explain the decline in inflation then if potential has gone down along with output why has inflation gone from whatever it is 2 percent to 1 percent 
mr dotsey given that unemployment has gone up to 10 percent and in jeffs graphs you thought that we had this 8 percent drop in marginal cost or some giant gap the question would be why hasnt inflation gone from 22 percent to minus 22 percent not from  22 percent to 1 percent 
mr lacker well the answer is always going to be our policy role right isnt it 
mr kohn weve changed targets 
mr lacker the answer to why inflation did what it did would be a combination of the model and our policy role 
chairman bernanke mike was kind enough to mention bernanke gertler and gilchrist earlier laughter i would point out that mark and other coauthors have updated that paper to include exactly those kinds of shocks and they get disinflation and all of those things  and whats happening is that as there is a shock to the capital of the banking system that prevents credit from going through to purchasers or small businesses or consumers or whatever the drop in their demand is just a decline in the aggregate demand curve and you get all the results you would expect from that 
a twohander from president evans 
mr evans well let me just say that i agree with many things that mike just said and in fact in the specification that justiniano and primiceri write down the output gap is not a fundamental  its a constructed variable and its really the marginal cost pricing as jeff mentioned that is going to be fundamental for how firms are setting prices  so thats absolutely right its also in the language that we as economic researchers are comfortable with and we can lay it out and understand it quite well  part of what were getting into is how we communicate with other people and with the public and resource slack tends to be a pretty good proxy in a number of cases so i think thats why we keep coming back to it  these memos are right to point out the cases where we are going to be misled by that and then the question is  how do we defend against that  i think our track record is pretty good  we always need to be reminded of this and getting the models better would be great 
chairman bernanke president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  i really enjoyed this discussion and the papers i thought they were really good  im going to review three things i said earlier on this issue and see if any of my views have changed given those priors that i laid down before the discussion 
one of the things i said earlier in a memo was that theoretical conceptions are hotly contestedthats just the state of play in the macro world  im actually happy to see a debate between the philadelphia conception the dsge model and the chicago conceptionit lays out explicitly heres what the assumptions are and im sorry its complicated but there are lots of issues there and thats where we are but theres also the question of moving between models where you can pin down what the output gap isa clear theoretical conception versus the traditional concept of an output gap  there you dont know what the mapping is back to the people youre trying to help with your policy and i think thats harder to swallow  and estimates given any concept are subject to difficult measurement issues and we understand that 
the second thing i said was okay forget about theory you dont care about theory blah blah blah you just want to find an object that will help you predict inflation and youre happy to use whatever this object is  i think that controlling for expectations a gap is only a marginal contributor to movements in inflation  i would say in the fuhrer et al work one interpretation of the empirical relationships that you see is precisely that monetary policy did not react sufficiently strongly to offset whatever shock hit the economy to keep you close to the inflation target 
one of the themes ive come back to over and again is that if were doing inflation targeting or some kind of quasiinflation targetingif thats what were doing if you run it really well and your tools are pretty effective you should be able pretty much to offset all of the shocks and keep inflation really close to target  you go back to run your regressions later and see what the relationships are its only going to look like inflation is related to the target or a constant so i think that is an issue for the empirical workfor those who want to throw away the theory and just find variables that are going to help you predict inflation  i think frankly that inflation targeting or quasiinflation targeting has worked pretty well over the last 15 years or so in the united states 
the third point i madea point on which the papers were particularly uninformativeis how gaps are related to bubbles and that i think is uncharted territory  a lot of our rhetoric says this is a housing bubble the housing bubble somehow collapsed and thats whats going on in this economy i dont see models that have those kinds of bubbles in them  to me a bubble has to mean something about an equilibrium that is not the fundamental equilibriumtheres this fundamental equilibrium in the economy but somehow actual prices and actual expectations are up somewhere far away from that fundamental  and then that collapses on you and you come back to the fundamental  what does that mean  does that mean that youre back at your trend and you shouldnt try to reinflate the bubble or what  i think the chairman has said that bubbles are one of the really tough issues of the decade for monetary policy and i agree completely with that 
the thing i was worried about for policy is that we might be overemphasizing output gaps in our policy discussions when we say blankettype things like well it looks like gaps are big or it looks like resource utilization is really low compared with some conception of where we think it should be and therefore there cant be any inflation in the near term or the medium term  i think that might be an overinterpretation of what both the theoretical and the empirical literature tell us 
i had comments on all of the papersim going to shorten this up  i just want to talk about the global slack hypothesis a little bit  weve been talking in the profession about globalization for years and years and years i have to say that the conventional wisdom the hallway discussion that you get on this is that you can treat the us like a closed economy and it is okay i actually think that that has not been that bad an approach over the past 25 years but we may be at an inflection point where that is not the right thing to do going forward if youre going to look at empirical evidence thats collected over the past 25 years youre going to get weak relationships with respect to the global output gaps or the global economy  that may not be the right way to think of things going forward 
i have also been concerned with the question of optimal policy in open economy settings which i think has generally been deemphasized around the table here for the reason i just gave for years but that may not be the thing to do going forward  in the fledgling literature on optimal policy and open economy models you have always got a situation where youve got some domestic prices youve got import prices and then youre going to construct a price index that includes both should you be reacting to those import prices thats the question  the models tell you no the models say you should have some conception of domestic prices or whatever the sticky prices are in your economy and you should react to those  the foreign central bank is already reacting to those prices in the foreign economy  so when you react to the import prices you are sort of doubly reacting because foreign monetary policy is already trying to control those prices so the fact that youre reacting back and forth then can create problems in the global equilibriuma bubble if you like  i worry about that and i dont think that that has been thought about carefully enough and i think it will become more and more important as we go forward especially with the rise of asia 
let me talk about the fuhrer et al paper for just a second  he has got backwardlooking expectations a theme to which i am very sympathetic  youre thinking about trying to measure this perfectly forwardlooking component during the great moderation or during the past 15 years a period where it may not be that important because in some sense nothing happened during that period but the question would be  if you get to special times is that really the way to think about expectations as purely extrapolating from the past  theres a famous paper in macroeconomicssome of you will know itcalled the ends of four big inflations by tom sargent he describes hyperinflations after world war i when prices were going up like crazy  the government makes a credible commitment on a day and the hyperinflation ends at noon on that dayits just amazing  so theres an example  it is a hugely stressed situation but rational expectations come in with a vengeance  are we in a highly stressed situation maybe we avoided depression 20 you might interpret that as a very special situation relative to the past 25 years thats what has got me a little worried about a backwardlooking approach to expectations i think the threats of sharp movements in this kind of environment are very real  we have to be careful about them  will they occur  maybe not  but we need to be very careful in this situation so thats just a comment on the fuhrer approach  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  ill try to keep my comments brief  i want to talk a little about what i took away from some of this  i found the papers very interesting and fun to read and think about one of the lessons i take away from thisand its one that ive taken away for some time and jeff referred to itis that a little humility may be in order in terms of our ability to truly understand particularly shortrun dynamics in the inflation process 
one of the things that i think we learned from this discussion is that depending on the model that you write down and depending on the nature of the shocks that you allow to hit that model you can get different outcomes you can get different relationships between variables within that model that means that we need to be a little cautious in our interpretation about how we rely in our policy discussions on one set of variables versus another set of variables in guiding our outlooks for inflation one of the things that i have tried to convey in some of my comments over the last several months is that i have been worried that in the way we talk about inflationparticularly the future of inflation and deflationwe have become a little too fixated on measures of output gaps  one of the things we learned from this is that depending on which output gap you write down and what you think of the shocks other things may matter so we need to be a little more careful about diversifying our portfolio about whats going to happen and protect ourselves from being put in a bad spot 
so i think humility is important  i think the nature of the shocks is important  i think the conversation between governor kohn and mike dotsey about what we think this shock is and what it did is a useful kind of conversation to have  the problem comes when the output gap becomes a shorthand for a whole bunch of other stuff and then it becomes a communication problem because it may or may not be the right shorthand  there may be circumstances where you need a different shorthand or a different measure  and thats where talking about the nature of the shocks becomes useful in how we think about it 
if you focus on traditional measures of the output gap it seems to me there are circumstances where with excessive emphasis on trying to close that gapim not talking about the current circumstances necessarilyyou may not be conducting policy in an optimal way or even increasing welfare you may actually reduce welfare if you focus on the wrong metric or the wrong target with the gaps so there may not be an easy onetoone correspondence at times between policy thats welfare improving and policy that closes gaps and we need to be cautious about that charlie evans commented earlier about taking other variables into account and it is very important that we do that 
the last comment ill make is that i want to reinforce janet yellens point because she and i agree on thissome people may find that unusual  given the uncertainty that we have about the class of models that we deal with theres a lot of work on robust rules  some of the staff in san franciscojohn williams and othershave worked hard on this  i find this work very useful because they take models where we actually can compute optimal policy and then ask what happens what kind of simple rules could we use that would get us close to something that looks like the optimal policy  theres been a great deal of work on this  the simple rules they write down typically are of a taylor rule variety with an output gap and a deviation of inflation from some target  one thing that comes out of those robust rules though is that the answer is not that the output gap doesnt matter  but in most of those exercises that im familiar with the weight on the output gap in the taylor rule tends to be pretty small  i think thats one of the things that is interesting about some of those rules  the important thing about those robust rules is that the weight on the deviation from inflation target gets very big and the weight on the output gap is relatively small in many cases 
one of the helpful things that we could do is think about the class of robust rules and about how robust these rules are against the class of models that are on the table  that could help focus our discussion and give us again this robustness in our policy thinking that could be very helpful  so im very positive towards that line of research in the literature because as we can see here today models are different and they can give different outcomes  we need to be cautious about what we know and how precise we are and not put too much weight on any one factor at any one point in timediversify our portfolio if you will  again my argument for lo these many months is to try to get our language to look more robust and a little less focused on single metrics 
i want to thank all of the reserve bank staff they did a great job and i think this has been a very useful discussion  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren i also want to thank each of the presenters for giving very good presentations over breakfast as jeff alluded to president plosser and i had i thought a very useful discussion about models and what was generating our results  i asked him given where the output gap was and given where at least some measures of marginal cost might be how he was getting inflation actually rising  and his answer was well the driver is really inflation expectations 
i have one question for each of you it will be quick  let me posit my questions to each of you first and then i will let you all speak  my first question is for mike  youve highlighted the difficulty with coming up with the output gap and i think its well understood that there are a lot of ways to calculate the output gap and there are estimation issues with the output gap  but when i look at forecasts of inflationif i look at the blue chip if i look at professional forecasters if i look at the dispersion in surveysi find that the modeling of inflation expectations by economists isnt much better than the modeling of output gaps  gary stern gave us the advice that you need a model to beat a model as he was leaving  so were not very good at modeling expectations it seems like we have much the same problem when modeling the output gap id like you to speak to the alternative which is how do we do a good job of modeling expectations or what more work needs to be done 
for mark my question is that based on my understanding of at least some of the international literature importers tend to price to the us market  if you could just put your work in the context of that observation i think that would be useful for me 
and for jeff in light of mikes comments and his paper i would be interested in your views of the implications of the way you model inflation given the alternative that mike has laid out in his paper 
mr dotsey thats a really excellent question which im going to answer in three parts in the models that were all looking at expectations are rational  to the extent that thats not a good approximation for how people actually form expectations then thats problematic for the models as well  people like jim bullard have worked on models of learning and other types of things and a lot of those models probably can be incorporated to try to flesh out expectational issues if we become uncomfortable with the assumption of rational expectations at high frequencies 
expectations are a dicey thing for the committee to base policy on because often they can be somewhat sticky as you allude to  if the committee were to lose some of its credibility often those expectations could look good but you could have lost the game and expectations are going to get out of hand i think the late 1970s and then the disinflation of the 1980s was an example of that  the inflation sort of led the expectationswe had this big runup in inflation and expectations followed it on the way down i think expectations of inflation actually followed the feds moves as it was gaining credibility and probably made the disinflationary costs in actuality a lot worse  so i think you are right to point out those types of things but again all i can do is say weve got these models on the table and thats the best we can do  and youre right to question perhaps some of the assumptions underlying what is going on 
mr wynne  on the question of the pricing to the us market we actually do consider this case one of the contributions in our background paper is to push some of the existing literature forward by explicitly incorporating the socalled local currency pricing assumptions as opposed to the producer currency pricing assumption 
if you go back to exhibit 6 in our handout thats what gives rise to these complicated additional terms in the phillips curve expression to capture these deviations from the law of one price if you dont have people pricing in dollars for the us market youre just going to have to worry about the domestic and foreign output gaps or domestic and foreign real marginal costs this is what makes it very tricky to test this idea that foreign influences matter because you can also just write down a phillips curve where all the foreign influences come in through a termsoftradelike term  but its a gapits a deviation of the terms of trade from its frictionless level 
a lot of very subtle econometric issues come up then in trying to figure out why the termsoftrade variable is in the phillips curve expression  is it to capture deviations from the law of one price or is it some sort of a summary statistic for all foreign slack  i think it makes a big difference to the validity of the hypothesis this was what motivated our final remark about why we really need to rethink some of the earlier econometric work some of the good work that was done here at the board of governors the work that the researchers at the bis have done and some of the earlier work we did on this question  however these termsoftrade variables look like some of the variables people have traditionally included in phillips curve regressions  we know that oftentimes youre going to need to put in energy prices or import prices or food prices in your traditional phillips curve to get the fit to work  and the theoretical framework we have laid out explains why these things may in fact matter  but a lot more work needs to be done before we could actually apply this to some of the policy issues jeff and mike have addressed in their presentations 
mr fuhrer thanks for your question eric  i would take on board some of michaels and coauthors caveats about the use of statistical gaps  i think my approach would be somewhat similar to what the chairman was saying in response to another questionwe wouldnt take a univariate approach in gauging the state of the economy  wed look to see whats going on with unemployment and id say its clearly elevated and i dont see evidence in traditional measures of reallocation to suggest that anything extraordinary is going on there  therefore i would take on board that a good portion maybe the majority of the increase in unemployment is really reflective of slack resources  when i couple that with the observations on marginal cost which are severely depressed i think i have several measures that all are telling me roughly the same story  so in that regard at least from the point of view that the gap or utilization is a driving variable i would expect some downward pressure on inflation 
now as we suggested in the discussion around the table inflation expectations might counterbalance that but i would emphasize in that regard at two levels that what i said in my presentation is that the implication of the models is that the inflation expectation really implies a concern for future marginal cost and gaps not just inflation expectations per se  thats at the pointyheaded rational expectations level  but lets take a step back and think along the lines that president narayana kocherlakota was saying about the importance of the microdata   
mr kocherlakota narayana rao kocherlakota  laughter 
mr fuhrer ill get the middle name next time  laughter the goal keeps increasing 
at the micro level lets think about the story that motivates these kinds of models that we use which at its base is not unreasonable and that is that there are firms who are trying to set prices what do they consider in trying to set prices  they think about their cost structure  thats where the marginal cost comes from  i would say that today the cost structure really is challenged wages are pressured to be quite low and productivity appears to be fairly high  so from the cost side that puts downward pressure  the other thing that they take into account is how much they can mark up over those costs  thats a factor of market power and current demand circumstances  and i would say there again the ability to mark up over their cost structure is not terrific so you dont need the pointyheaded rational expectations model to tell you that the key determinants that fold into these models would suggest that in current circumstances the pressures on inflation taking into account expectations and costs and gaps or whatever else appear to be on the downside  thats the way i would answer that question 
now i did say as president plosser emphasized that we need to have some humility when we approach this and i think that to date we are starting to see perhaps the beginning of a puzzle that says as mike dotsey suggested that inflation maybe should have fallen more than these models have suggested  and i think well be looking at that carefully because if it doesnt fall noticeably over the next year we have some splaining to do  laughter and that will require some additional thought  so thank you for the question and thats what i would say 
chairman bernanke the ricky ricardo theory of economics  laughter president hoenig  
mr hoenig thank you just a short observation  this is as others have said very interesting in terms of inflation dynamics and output gaps  and i agree that we need to use models and work them and then apply our judgment to the situation 
but i also want to remind the committee that we do need to begin to think differently in some ways  i cant help but recall that in 2003 borio and white gave a paper at the jackson hole symposium on issues around not so much bubbles but very strong expansion and the conditions we create that cause these cycles if you will  it means that you can look at where interest rates are relative to at least an estimated longterm equilibrium rate and at how fast credit growth is moving in a particular period of time  if you reread that paper now you will think they were on to something  while we need these output gaps and so forth the financial system is driving a lot of whats happening and we need to bring that into the equation more directly  maybe thats what you were referring to regarding the updates to the papers that you have been involved with 
theres more to it than the output gap and im a little worried because of that about making inflation targeting your goal because you can have a very stable inflation environment for a while and have a very volatile financial environment with the excesses that go on there  so i recommend that you all reread that paper  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you for reminding us about that   
any other comments no response if not let me once again thank the staff for all your work and for your coordination and it was a very enjoyable discussion  the next meeting is another twoday meeting january 26 and 27  the meeting is adjourned  there is lunch available in the anteroom for those who can stay thank you 
end of meeting
