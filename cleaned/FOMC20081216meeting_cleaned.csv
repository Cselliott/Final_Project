transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on december 1516 2008
december 15 2008afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  we welcome chris cumming
who is sitting in for new york  as you know under the extraordinary circumstances we added an
extra day to the meeting  the purpose of the meeting taking place today is to discuss the zero lower
bound and related policy and governance issues and i hope that the discussion today will set up our
policy decision for tomorrow
just for preview purposes the program today will start with bill dudley and qa  well
then have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound and alternative policies  well have a go
round on those issues including nontraditional policies and communications associated with it and
so on  let me just mention that on the agenda for tomorrow after the policy decision we have the
subcommittees report on longrun projections and the quarterly projections  we put that there to
save time and to make sure that we met our deadlines but obviously theres some linkage between
that and the discussion today and if anyone wants to bring that up today please feel free to do so
finally if were very efficientas i hope we will beid like to get to the staff economic briefing
at the end of today if possibleif not notand then theres dinner afterwards  so without further
ado let me turn to bill dudley  bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  unfortunately this package is a little thicker than usual but thats the way it goes i guess  the stimulus provided by monetary policy to the real economy depends not only on the level of the federal funds rate but also on the health of the financial system  the ability of market participants to intermediate and act effectively as the transmission channel between the change in the federal funds rate target and financial asset prices is critical  when bank and dealer balance sheets are constrained as they are now this transmission mechanism is impaired and traditional monetary policy instruments become limited in their ability to support economic activity

1  the materials used by mr dudley are attached to this transcript appendix 1
the recent sharp deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the forced deleveraging of the nonbank portion of the financial sector have led to sharp declines in asset values during the past few months  the consequence will be further big marktomarket losses for investment and commercial bank trading books and a significant increase in loanloss provisions on commercial bank loan books  these losses are likely to intensify the vise on financial firm balance sheets and that is likely to further impede the federal reserves efforts to ease financial conditions  as a consequence a broadening of our suite of liquidity facilities that bypass banks and dealers may prove to be necessary
equities corporate debt and securitized assetsespecially commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbshave all been hard hit and the commodity sector the preferred asset class of choice earlier in the year has been clobbered  as shown in exhibit 1 of the handout us equity prices fell sharply beginning in september  although the aggregate indexes have bounced off their low points the sp 500 index had still fallen 30 percent between the end of august and the end of november  this is the relevant quarter for goldman sachs and morgan stanley which report this week  in the current calendar quarter despite the rebound the sp 500 index has declined about 25 percent  the carnage has also been evident
abroad especially in emerging markets  the corporate debt market has scarcely been more hospitable  the highyield corporate bond yield for some broad indexes has climbed above 20 percent exhibit 2  assuming a 20 percent recovery rate on defaults yield levels in this sector appear to fully discount a default experience consistent with the peak reached in the great depression  the securitization markets have performed little better  not only are most securitized markets shut to new issuance but also the yields on even the highestrated outstanding tranches have climbed sharply  exhibit 3 illustrates the current spreads for different types of
aaarated consumer securitizationscredit cards auto loans and student loans exhibit 4 illustrates the sharp deterioration in valuations in the cmbs market  the left panel shows spreads on a basket of post2003 vintages  the right panel shows the price performance of particular aaarated cmbs tranches  most have fallen about 20 points in the past quarter
commodity prices also continue to plummet  as shown in exhibit 5 the declines have been particularly pronounced in the energy and industrial metals sectors  in contrast gold prices have held up quite well exhibit 6 especially since the october fomc meeting  gold prices presumably have been supported by the drop in global shortterm interest rates which reduces the carrying cost of owning gold  it is also possible that gold is viewed as a hedge against the risk that central bank policy actions could ultimately prove inflationary  presumably the fear may be that the exit from these policies could be delayed or prove more difficult to engineer than generally anticipated
this poor performance of financial and real assets has a number of important implications  in particular the earnings of most major financial intermediaries will be very poor this quarter  for example the two investment banks that report this
week are almost certainly likely to record large marktomarket losses the wall street journal reported earlier that goldman sachs will report a loss of around
2 billion when it reports tomorrow morning  this may actually understate the carnage because compensation booked for previous quarters can be reversed and the reversal of income taxes paid will reduce the size of the loss  commercial banks will also not be spared when they report next month  not only will they have significant losses on their trading books but also loanloss provisions are likely to climb sharply jpmorgan indicated last week that the current quarter has been terrible and they have been one of the bestperforming commercial banks
the sharp decline in asset prices is also likely to reinforce the deleveraging process that is occurring throughout the financial sector  although hedge fund performance in november was better than in the previous months preliminary figures show that the aggregate index continues to slide exhibit 7  were down about 17 or 18 percent so far this year and thats the worst performance in hedge fund history in the aggregate by a significant margin  although the redemption deadlines for year end have generally passed this pressure will persist into the first quarter and beyond for two reasons  first many fundoffunds managers will get another round of redemption requests before yearend which will cause them to ask for monies from the hedge funds that are part of their fundoffunds families in the first quarter
second some hedge funds restrict or gate the rate of withdrawals  for example citadel suspended all redemptions for their two biggest funds through march 31
this means that there will be a backlog in unfulfilled requests that will take time to satisfy  the bernard madoff scandal may also lead to additional redemption requests
the losses suffered by dealers and banks mean that their balance sheet constraints will continue to stymie the federal reserves efforts to supply liquidity to prospective borrowers  as shown in exhibit 8 recent taf auctions have been undersubscribed and as shown in exhibit 9 the amount of dollar liquidity supplied via our swap lines has stabilized even though term libor remains elevated well above the minimum bid rate that we charge on those auctions and the fact that swaps are openended in size  the problem is no longer one of supplying sufficient liquidity to the banks and dealers  the problem is getting these intermediaries to pass the liquidity onward to their clients
balance sheet constraints reveal themselves in many guises  although libor ois spreads have narrowed somewhat they remain very elevated relative to historical levels exhibits 10 and 11 jumbo mortgage rate spreads remain wide relative to conforming mortgage rates exhibit 12 and cash instruments that take balance sheet room trade at significantly higher spreads than the corresponding derivatives that dont  exhibit 13 illustrates the spread between highyield cash bonds and the corresponding cdx highyield derivatives index  this widening in that basis is one reason that some banks have taken large losses in the fourth quarter  evidence that balance sheet constraints are impeding the availability and cost of credit continues to proliferate  this is obviously important because if credit is not available on reasonable terms this is likely to exacerbate the downward pressure on the economy
a darker economic outlook in turn threatens to lead to more losses and balance sheet pressures reinforcing the downward dynamic
in terms of credit availability the commercial mortgage area appears to be particularly vulnerable  according to industry sources about 400 billion of mortgage debtmost put on five to seven years agoneeds to be refinanced when it comes due in 2009  in recent years commercial banks and the cmbs market provided the major source of funds for the commercial mortgage market  the owners of this commercial real estate are worried that without new federal reserve and treasury initiatives funding will not be available to refinance this mortgage debt in 2009 on virtually any terms  investmentgrade and highyield corporate debt will also have to be refinanced  exhibit 14 illustrates that more than 600 billion of term investmentgrade corporate debt will need to be refinanced in 2009  so far this market still looks open for business but it may become less so if the macroeconomic environment continues to deteriorate
enough gloomy news  in the credit markets are there any areas that have shown improvement  the answer of course is yes  in those areas in which the federal government including the federal reserve has applied the most force the situation has generally stabilized or improved  let me briefly give a few examples  first the fdic funding guarantee the citigroup intervention and the 250 billion of tarp money allocated for bank capital seem to have stabilized the banking sector  as shown in exhibits 15 and 16 cds spreads have been pretty stable recently despite the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook  second the commercial paper funding facility cpff has led to significant improvement in the commercial paper market
as shown in exhibit 17 the yields on highly rated commercial paper have declined as this has occurred the cpff has become less attractive and the number of issuers and the amount of commercial paper purchased each day by the cpff have moderated sharply exhibit 18  just as important after an initial surge in which the cpff represented virtually all of the longdated maturity issuance the cpff share of longdated issuance has fallen significantly exhibit 19  so far the cpff has  worked pretty much as designed  third our announcement and purchases of agency debt have brought in agency debt spreads relative to treasuries  for example in the fiveyear sector debt spreads for fannie mae and freddie mac have narrowed more than 50 basis points since the last fomc meeting  fourth our announcement that the federal reserve would purchase up to 500 billion in gse mortgagebacked securities has caused the spread between conforming mortgages and treasuries to narrow sharply  coupled with the fall in treasury yieldsencouraged somewhat by the chairmans suggestion in a speech that the federal reserve might buy longdated treasuries for the somathis has caused conforming mortgage rates to drop sharply exhibits 20 21 and 22  as a result mortgage refinancing activity has climbed sharply  exhibit 23 illustrates the spike upward in the mortgage bankers association mortgage applications to refinance index that has occurred in the past two weeks

exhibits 24 and 25 contrast the performance in markets with federal government intervention to those markets without  spreads have generally narrowed where there has been intervention and widened elsewhere  the contrast in the behavior of spreads suggests that one might wish to expand our existing facilities further  the talf is  an obvious potential candidate given that it could conceivably be extended in multiple dimensionsincluding the scope of asset classes vintage and credit quality  in my opinion the liquidity facilities should be viewed as part of our suite of monetary policy tools  the impulse of monetary policy to the real economy depends not just on the level of the federal funds rate but more important also on the impact on financial conditions  in normal times movements in the federal funds rate result in moves in financial conditions in the same direction  markets do the work and financial conditions ease as the federal funds rate is cut  but in extraordinary times such as the present in which banks and dealers are unwilling to onlend liquidity because of balance sheet constraints federal funds rate reductions alone may be ineffective in easing financial conditions  in such an environment special liquidity facilities that bypass the banks and dealers may prove necessary to ease financial conditions
however expansion of our liquidity tools does blow up our balance sheet  exhibit 26 shows the growth of the balance sheet and the changes in its composition over time
since late september the balance sheet has grown sharply mainly because of the expansion of our foreignexchange swap program shown in light blue the cpff shown in brown and the taf program shown in purple  as shown in exhibit 27 which is a snapshot of our balance sheet late last week this has caused excess reserves to rise sharply  the growth in excess reserves has been exacerbated by the rolling off of the treasury sfp supplementary finance program bills  we peaked at about 500 billion earlier and now we have 364 billion of sfp bills on our balance sheet  the treasury was unwilling to continue this program at its earlier level because of worries about reaching the debt limit ceiling in the first quarter and because they would have had to notify the congress 60 days before that

turning now to the desks efforts to implement monetary policy and the fomcs directive the effective federal funds rate has continued to trade soft relative to the target rate exhibit 28  the interest rate paid on excess reserves ioer rate has not been a perfect substitute for the treasury sfp program  because the ioer rate for the twoweek reserve maintenance period is set at the lowest level that occurred anytime during that period the sharp drop last thursday evident in the exhibit occurred because banks anticipate a substantial cut in the federal funds rate target and the ioer rate at this fomc meeting  the drop in the effective rate has occurred even though we have increased the rate paid on excess reserves to equal the federal funds rate target  although some of this softness in the effective rate relative to the target reflects the sales of federal funds by gses that are not eligible to be paid interest on excess reserves this is by no means the whole story  the unwillingness of major banks to bid more aggressively for these funds is an important factor  this unwillingness to fully arbitrage the gap between the ioer rate and the effective federal funds rate is another consequence of the lack of balance sheet capacity in the banking sector  although we are exploring ways to remove most of the gse effect from the picture even if we were to be successful in doing this we expect that the
balance sheet constraints would still be powerful enough to cause the effective federal funds rate to trade soft relative to the target  also if the gse federal funds volumes were removed it is not clear what the effective target would represent because trading volumes could then turn out to be very very low
the drop in the effective federal funds rate has been accompanied by a corresponding drop in other shortterm interest rates  in particular general collateral repo rates have collapsed almost all the way to zero exhibit 29  this is likely to lead to a rise in treasury fails because when general collateral repo rates are very low the cost of shorting treasury securities becomes negligible  as fails climb in turn this erodes market function in the treasury market and reduces the usefulness of the treasury market as a hedging vehicle for other fixedincome assets  the effect of fails on treasury market function can be seen in exhibit 30 which shows how errors in our treasury yield curve model have increased as shortterm interest rates have fallen close to zero
in terms of monetary policy expectations the federal funds rate futures curves exhibit 31 and the eurodollar futures curves exhibit 32 continue to shift lower however with the effective federal funds rate persistently trading below the target rate it is unclear how much of this shift represents a change in expectations about what the committee will do with respect to the target  the primary dealer credit survey sheds considerably more light here  as shown in exhibits 33 and 34 rate expectations have shifted lower since the last fomc meeting  all 16 respondents to our most recent survey expect the fomc to reduce the target with most 13 out of
16 calling for a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate  no dealer expects a 25 basis point cut at this meeting  two are at a 75 basis point cut and one anticipates a 100 basis point reduction in the target rate  a slim majority9 out of 16expect a 50 basis point target to be the trough for the target rate  most expect that the fomc will not cut the target at future meetings and no rate hikes are expected by anyone until the second half of 2009 at the earliest  comparing exhibits 33 and 34 the most recent survey shows considerably less dispersion in the fourquartersahead federal funds rate forecasts
finally for completeness i include our standard chart on inflation expectations as measured by the boards and barclays measures of the fiveyear fiveyearforward breakeven inflation rate exhibit 35  i dont think these breakeven rates provide much information right now because the tips market has been heavily influenced by the sharp fall in cpi inflation that will accrue to tips over the next few months and by the growing illiquidity of tips versus nominal treasuries  interestingly the most recent primary dealer survey shows no change in fiveyear fiveyearforward expectations for cpi inflation with the average of the group remaining at 24 percent there is however somewhat greater dispersion on both sides indicating uncertainty about how successful the federal reserve will be in keeping core pce inflation in the comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent on a longerterm basis exhibit 36
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote as always to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the october fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  there was a sharp decline in the spike in the fails
recently
mr dudley  yes  there are two potential explanations and its really hard to sort out
whats driving it  one is just that trading volumes have come down and as trading volumes have
come down fails have come down  so thats part of it  its just tied to trading volume  the second
explanation is that the treasury market practices group published a best practices report basically
arguing that a penalty rate should be put on fails and it is going to design a road map to show how
that might be implemented in practice  it may be that given that publication people who before
might have been more cavalier about shorting treasury securities at very low interest rates are now
somewhat less inclined to do so just because of the moral suasion of that report that it is not a good
thing to do  so it is some combination of those two i think
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions for bill  president hoenig
mr hoenig  bill in your discussion on exhibit 13 and around the idea that a number of
resets are coming for mortgagesthe earlier sevenyear arms and so forthand as you also look
forward to where mortgage rates are why are you anticipating trouble with the ability to refinance
given the outlook for mortgages rates
mr dudley  i think you have to distinguish between conforming mortgage markets and
everything else  the conforming mortgage market is doing fine  some spreads are a little wider
than they have been historically but our actions seem to have been pretty successful in bringing
those spreads in a bit  so the conforming mortgage market rate is fine  the problem is in
commercialmortgagebacked securities and nonconforming mortgages  the appetite to provide
financing there is very very much impaired especially in the commercial mortgage market
mr hoenig  right  okay  that clarifies  thank you
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  bill has the fdics temporary liquidity guarantee program interfered with
or added to the confusion in the purchase and sales of fed funds or has our excluding sales under
one month changed the picture
mr dudley  i dont think it has created much confusion  the biggest confusion is who
is guaranteed and who is not and which instruments are guaranteed and which instruments are not  i
think people will have trouble sorting that out  most of the issuance has been long termthree
years  people say well if im paying 75 basis points let me get the most value for that  so there
hasnt really been much channel conflict with the very short end and i think that the fact that one
month and in is not covered also has reduced that potential channel conflict
mr fisher  is that pretty well understood in the marketplace
mr dudley  i think so
mr fisher  then speaking of guarantees i have just one more question if i may mr
chairman  in chart 14 are these net of credits that might have some kind of government guarantee
mr dudley  this is total  in fact when you look at the issuance of investmentgrade
corporate debt recently theres quite a bit of it but most of it is the guaranteed stuff
mr fisher  yes
mr dudley  so excluding the guaranteed stuff the issuance volumes do not look as
robust as the aggregate number suggests because so much of that is the guaranteed stuff
mr fisher  so for 2009
mr dudley  i dont have the number off the top of my head
mr fisher  its not this total
mr dudley  no
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  any other questions  president bullard
mr bullard  at the beginning of your comments you said that you expected further
big marktomarket losses  do you mean over and above what markets anticipate now
mr dudley  no  i mean that in the fourth quarter they will reflect the decline that
occurred from august 30 to november 30 for the investment banks  september 30 to december 30
just hasnt been yet recorded on their balance sheet  they havent announced it yet
mr bullard  you cited that goldman number of 2 billion but thats been widely
reported
mr dudley  that has been widely reported  morgan stanley is also going to report this
week and it is highly likely they will have similar losses
mr bullard  then i just want to understandon exhibit 2 you said something about a
fully discounted default rate last seen in the great depression  what did you mean by that
mr dudley  well if you basically take that 21 percent and compare it with the default
rates in the great depression and write down some numbers for recoveries if you had a default rate
equal to the great depression default rate and you had a 20 percent recovery youd actually do
pretty well owning highyield debt at these levels right now  so the level of yields fully discounts
horrific default rates
chairman bernanke  in fairness these are junk bonds  these are lowrated
companies
mr dudley  well yes  it is possible that we could have default rates greater than those
of the great depression  im just saying that these levels discount that kind of outcome  obviously
the highyield debt market today is different from general default rates  yeah i think thats a fair
point
mr bullard  do we know  was there something like a junk market in the great
depression that we can compare this with
mr dudley  well there were certain leveraged utility companies that you could argue
were pretty junky
mr fisher  corporate grade became junk in the great depression
chairman bernanke  michael milken hadnt been born yet  laughter  president
lacker
mr lacker  thats a calculation that embeds risk neutrality into the extrapolation
mr dudley  well you could solve for the risk premium that was left over and we did a
backoftheenvelope calculation in new york on that  it was an excess return of about 600 basis
points
mr lacker  doesnt that depend on the assumption about the correlation between
mr dudley  look  this is back of the envelope  obviously youd have to dig down
pretty deeply to try to separate whats the default rate and whats the risk premium  but the point
here is that the market is discounting very adverse outcomes
mr bullard  i just want to follow up on that  would you say that that represents a
tremendous amount of pessimism out there or are you saying that you think were going to get
default rates like the great depression
mr dudley  no i think its some combination  i dont think you can really separate
how much of it is default rate versus how much of it is risk premium  the point is that theres
probably a considerable amount of both  clearly the risk premiums are high because we see risk
premiums on safe assets being very very high  the classic example is the student loan which is
97 percent guaranteed by the federal government trading at libor plus 350 or libor plus 400
thats probably a pretty good measure of risk premiumthats your underlying risk premium on all
assets maybe a few hundred basis points
chairman bernanke  president lacker has a twohander
mr lacker  first about the risk premium its either a lot of pessimism or a lot of
correlation between defaults and bad states of the world and essentially low growth  the second
thing i took a look at the studentloanassetbacked securities that you talked aboutffelp  i
think you have a chart here  it turns out that the trusts are guaranteed a rate of return equal to the
commercial paper rate and any excess over that they have to return to the department of education
they get a payment if the return is below that  your coupon is 200 points above libor and
libor is trading a bit above commercial paper rates right  so theres a negative spread built into
the trust documents  theyre paying 300 basis points more than theyre earning on the trust  so a
little extra premium seems pretty reasonable  is my understanding of that security correct bill
mr dudley  i think what youre describing is the perspective from the issuer of the
obligation  the issuer of the obligation has a problem because on one side they get commercial
paper and on the other side they get libor and so they have a mismatch  they have essentially a
basis risk  but about where securities are trading in the market or what endinvestors can invest in
the securitiesi think youre referring more to the issuers of the securities and the chart i showed
is what investors in the aaa tranches get  so i think its a slightly different thing
mr lacker  well wouldnt investors want to discount or take into account the fact that
the trust which is their only source of payment is earning about 300 basis points less than the
coupon  wouldnt that show up in a higher premium on what the investor is willing to pay
mr dudley  i dont see it that way
mr wilcox  president lacker its a complicated security but its wrapped by a
guarantee that ultimately the department of education will make good on to the tune of 97 cents on
the dollar  theres one little detail that is causing another piece of friction in the market and that is
that if the servicer doesnt perform on the loan then the department of education has the right to
not make good on the guarantee  but other than that its about 97 percent guaranteed
mr dudley  we think theyre pretty safenot perfectly safe but pretty safe
mr lacker  okay
mr wilcox  apparently the ability of the department of education not to make good on
the guarantee is very rarely exercised
mr lacker  but the department of education doesnt guarantee libor plus a 200
basis point coupon  it guarantees the commercial paper rate
mr wilcox  i believe bills point is that it guarantees a return to the investor
mr lacker  that still doesnt seem that irrationally priced  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  other questions for bill  if not we need a motion to
ratify domestic open market operations
mr kohn  i so move
chairman bernanke  any objections  all right  thank you  lets turn now to
brian and well have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound  im being reminded that this is a
joint boardfomc meeting  im reconvening a board meeting that began this morning  thank
you
mr madigan  thank you mr chairman  as the committee requested at your last meeting the staff has provided background for your discussion today of issues related to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates  ten days ago we sent you 21 notes covering lessons from the us and japanese experiences in disinflationary or deflationary environments the possible costs to financial markets and institutions of very low interest rates the potential benefits of further rate reductions and the advantages and disadvantages of nonstandard approaches to providing macroeconomic stimulus that could be employed when the federal funds rate cannot be reduced further  numerous staff members contributed to these notestoo many to recognize individually right now  but i would nevertheless like to thank them collectively for their intensive efforts on this project when many were already quite busy with other important assignments  steve meyer will now summarize the key conclusions from the staff work and then i will review the suggested questions for discussion that we sent to you last week  steve
mr meyer  thank you brian  by way of background the greenbook and many private forecasters project a sizable drop in real gdp from mid2008 to mid 2009 followed by sluggish growth into 2010 even with shortterm interest rates barely above zero and with substantial fiscal stimulus  the board staff and the median forecaster in the december blue chip survey predict that unemployment will peak around 825 percent in 2010  the greenbook forecast shows core pce inflation dropping below 1 percent in 2010 many private forecasters envision similar disinflation  moreover responses to a special question in the latest blue chip survey indicate that private forecasters see a sizable risk of deflation and stochastic simulations of frbus that take the greenbook forecast as the baseline suggest a roughly 1in4 chance that the core pce price index will decline over one or more of the next five years  in short forecasts generally suggest that additional stimulus would be desirable
with the target federal funds rate at 1 percent and the effective rate significantly lower the committee has little scope for using conventional monetary policy to stimulate the economy  as a practical matter the systems large liquidityproviding operations and the treasurys decision to scale back the supplementary financing program make it likely that the effective federal funds rate will remain quite low into the new year  even so the committee could choose to apply some additional stimulus by reducing its target federal funds rate and pushing the effective funds rate closer to zero
the research literature strongly suggests that a central bank should quickly cut its target rate to zero when it faces a substantial probability that conventional monetary policy will in a few quarters be constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates  but as discussed in several of the notes you received on december 5
driving shortterm interest rates to zero would have costs as well as benefits  zero or nearzero rates cause a high volume of fails in the treasury securities market leading to decreased liquidity in that market and potentially in other fixedincome markets
and if shortterm rates remain very close to zero some money market funds probably will close  such costs may argue against cutting the target funds rate to zero and driving the effective rate closer to zero
whether or not the committee chooses to cut its target rate to zero policymakers may find it helpful to expand the use of nonstandard monetary tools  in the current environment using such tools has two potential benefits  first they may help the federal reserve achieve better expected outcomes on both parts of the dual mandate second nonstandard tools could help mitigate the risk of an even more negative outcome  it may prove useful to group nonstandard tools into four broad categories and treat each category in turn
the first category is simple quantitative easing  this approach uses conventional open market operations such as buying shortterm government debt and conducting repurchase agreements to raise excess reserves in the banking system to a level well beyond that required to drive shortterm interbank rates to zero  the objective is to spur bank lending by ensuring that banks have ample funding at very low cost  the japanese experience suggests that greatly expanding excess reserves per se has limited success in spurring bank lending and thus has modest macroeconomic effects when banks and borrowers have weak balance sheets
the second category of nonstandard policy tools is targeted openmarket purchases of longerterm securities  the objective here would be to reduce term spreads or credit spreads and thus reduce the longerterm interest rates that are relevant for many investment decisions  the committee could for example direct the desk to buy a large amount of longerterm treasuries  the bank of japan bought sizable quantities of japanese government bonds its purchases are thought to have lowered yields  the available evidence for the united states suggests that adding
50 billion of longerterm treasury securities to the soma portfolio a bit less than  1 percent of publicly held treasury debt probably would lower yields on such securities somewhere between 2 and 10 basis points a substantially bigger purchase could have a disproportionately larger effect as longerterm treasuries became  scarce  of course what matters for the macroeconomy is the effect on private agents borrowing costs and wealth  those effects are difficult to predict  corporate bond yields should decline with treasury bond yields though perhaps less if supply effects are the main reason treasury yields fall  but corporate bond yields could decline more than yields on treasuries if the committees action reduces investors concerns about downside risks and thus reduces credit risk premiums  such a boost to
confidence could also lift stock prices and household wealth  another possibility is to instruct the desk to buy a large quantity of gse debt and mortgagebacked securities to reduce their yields and thus drive down mortgage rates  as bill noted markets reacted positively to the november 25 announcement that the federal reserve will buy 100 billion of gse debt and up to 500 billion of agencybacked mbs yields
on 10year gse debt and optionadjusted mbs yields fell about 60 basis points that day and the spread over 10year treasury yields narrowed about 40 basis points
quoted rates on conventional conforming mortgages declined a similar amount in subsequent days  the magnitude of the announcement effect which is consistent with estimates from the research literature suggests that additional targeted purchases of agency debt and mbs could provide further macroeconomic stimulus
the third major category of nonstandard tools encompasses special liquidity and lending facilities  the board could choose to expand current facilities or create new ones  special liquidity facilities for banks and other financial firms are intended to help them meet their customers needs for credit by providing a reliable source of funding even if the markets in which those lenders usually raise funds are disrupted or if their depositors withdraw funds  indeed these facilities seem to be meeting these needs effectively  the term auction facility or taf is one example the asset backed commercial paper money market mutual fund lending facility or amlf is another  liquidity facilities may also support specific funding markets  the idea is that such markets are more likely to function if borrowers are confident that they will be able to issue and roll over debt and if lenders are assured that they will be able to fund purchases of debt instruments or reduce their holdings of such instruments when necessary  the commercial paper funding facility or cpff is an example of this sort of program  although the commercial paper market has not returned to normal the cpff has been helpful in supporting overall credit flows and reducing some  credit spreads  direct discount window lending to creditworthy nonfinancial firms is another potential tool for supporting economic activity  the federal reserve act allows such lending on a secured basis if the borrower is unable to obtain adequate credit from banking institutions during unusual and exigent circumstances
significant further expansion of the systems lending programs would raise a host of issues  new facilities that lend directly to individuals partnerships or corporations would have to meet the requirements in section 133 of the federal reserve act  the reserve banks would take on more credit risk unless the treasury or other parties took substantial firstloss positions  moral hazard would become a larger issue  the resulting increase in reserve balances would further complicate the implementation of monetary policy unless the fomc were willing to accept a federal funds rate of essentially zero  developing satisfactory exit strategies would be challenging  and the practical burdens of designing and operating a sizable number of new liquidity facilities would be substantial  even so some expansion might prove useful if credit conditions do not improve
communication and commitment strategies are the fourth and final category of nonstandard policy tools  in current circumstances the committee might use such strategies in an effort to lower market expectations of future shortterm interest rates and thus reduce longterm rates or it might wish to prevent expectations of deflation from taking hold  i will mention three strategies that the committee might pursue
first research suggests that it would be helpful for the committee to be explicit about its longerterm goals particularly about its goal for inflation  foreign experience supports the theoretical prediction that an explicit and credible inflation objective helps anchor longerrun inflation expectations and thus can help prevent a downward drift in expected inflation and an upward drift in real interest rates during a protracted period of high unemployment and slowing inflation  that is an explicit longerrun inflation target can prevent the public from thinking that the federal reserve will allow inflation to remain persistently below rates that the committee has previously said are desirable  the committee has discussed the pros and cons of a numerical objective for inflation several times  you may wish to consider whether the significant risk of deflation and the near certainty that the zero lower bound will constrain conventional monetary policy have changed the costbenefit calculus
second the committee could announce that it will seek to run a somewhat higher rate of inflation for a number of years than it will seek in the long run  such a promise if deemed credible would stimulate real activity by raising inflation expectations and reducing medium and longterm real interest rates  researchers have proposed several approaches for dealing with the zero lower bound that would operate in this fashion including targeting a slowly rising price level  these approaches would be a significant departure from historical practice and so their pros and cons would need to be evaluated carefully
third research suggests that it would be helpful for the committee to provide moreexplicit information about its views on the likely future path of the federal funds rate  suppose for example that the committee concludes that it most likely will need to keep the federal funds rate close to zero for some time to spur an economic recovery and to prevent a persistent decline in inflation  in the current environment an announcement to that effect might lead market participants to expect the funds rate to remain near zero for a longer time than they now think likely the announcement might also lead to an increase in expected inflation  those changes in expectations would lower nominal and real bond yields providing some stimulus to economic activity  theory suggests that it would be important to make clear that the committees current view about the likely future path of policy is conditional on current information and the current outlook and to spell out how the actual policy path would depend on a range of possible future outcomes  communicating this conditionality could be difficult
the bottom line from the staffs analysis is that unconventional monetary policy tools can be useful complements to welldesigned fiscal stimulus and to steps to recapitalize and strengthen the financial system  additional purchases of longerterm securities expansion of targeted lending facilities and explicit statements of policymakers goals and intentions all seem likely to be useful when conventional monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates
our limited experience with these tools makes it difficult to estimate the amount of macroeconomic stimulus that would be generated by each and thus makes it difficult to calibrate their application  if the committee and the board choose to make greater
use of nonstandard tools now or in the near future it may be appropriate to deal with the uncertainty by using the tools in combination  finally the bank of japans experience suggests that nonstandard tools are more likely to be effective if they are used aggressively  ill now turn back to brian
mr madigan2  the staff provided eight questions to help frame your discussion and those questions are included in the package we have placed before youa single page with a blue cover sheet  i would like to comment briefly on each of them
the first question deals with the issue of whether policy adjustments should be accelerated when the zero bound looms as the research literature indicates or whether the committee should keep its powder dryfor example if it believes that the announcements of rate cuts have some special ability to buoy confidence  in present circumstances a key practical consideration is that the systems liquidity programs have already resulted in a very low effective federal funds rate  absent a very substantial unwinding of those facilities the effective funds rate will remain close to zero for the foreseeable future even if the committee adopts a significantly positive target for the federal funds rate  still the announcement of cuts in the target rate probably would trigger further reductions in the prime rate and thus in rates paid by a sizable fraction of debtors  alternatively the committee might set a target rate significantly above zero to convey its intentions for the stance of monetary policy over a period longer than the intermeeting period
the second question concerns your views of the costs of very low interest rates in the financial markets very low shortterm rates are likely to erode liquidity fails will increase and the returns available on some shortterm investments simply will not overcome the transaction costs  the staff research concluded that certain financial intermediaries such as treasuryonly money market funds will clearly be adversely affected by very low interest rates and those adverse effects could have spillover effects into other markets such as the repo market  but not all financial institutions will be hurt by low rates there will be winners and losers depending partly on their assetliability mix  moreover our work suggested that financial institutions in the aggregate tend to benefit from the macroeconomic stimulus of monetary policy easing  overall judging the point at which the marginal costs of rate reductions exceed the marginal benefits is quite difficult
the third question asks whether you see a net benefit from communicating your intentions for inflation beyond the next few years or your views about the likely stance of monetary policy over some period longer than the intermeeting period
specifically we suggested that you comment on the desirability of stating 1 that you intend to hold the funds rate at very low levels until specified conditions prevail 2 that the committee is concerned about the risks of excessive disinflation and will act to mitigate that risk or 3 that the committee will be willing to temporarily accept higher rates of inflation in the next few years in order to limit the economic downturn

2  the materials used by mr madigan are attached to this transcript appendix 2
and encourage recovery  the draft statements presented in the policy alternatives section of the bluebook include language that you might consider if you decide to pursue one or more of these possibilities
questions 4 through 8 cover nonstandard policy tools  question 4 asks your views about the benefits of large open market operations in agency debt agency mbs and treasury securities  such purchases are clearly within the authority of the fomc and the staff research suggests that they have definite potential to stimulate economic activity by lowering longerterm interest rates although calibrating those effects is difficult  however members could be troubled by the fact that purchases of agency debt and mbs could be regarded as steering funds to the gses and to particular economic sectors  in your responses to this question you may want to comment on whether you are concerned by the creditallocation aspects of such purchases  you may also want to provide your views on the channels through which purchases of treasuries or agency securities would have a beneficial effect  in particular do you see the power of such tools as arising from their effects in reducing longterm yields and spreads and supporting aggregate demand through those channels  or would you emphasize the increase in excess reserves and the monetary base that would accompany such purchases and the possible effects on bank lending
question 5 relates to liquidity facilities  as steve noted the creation of additional lending facilities is another potentially powerful policy tool for the federal reserve particularly in current circumstances in which credit flows in some markets are severely disrupted  some of those facilities appear to have been successful in supporting credit flows and thus economic activity  but even though further additions or expansions could be helpful to credit intermediation taking these steps would involve a number of substantive issues  also the design implementation and ongoing operation of such facilities pose real resource challenges to the system
moreover these programs raise governance issues  because such programs generally rely on the section 133 lending authority authorization of these programs is the responsibility of the board and the decision to lend is made by the reserve bank  at the same time these programs create reserves and thus potentially affect the fomcs ability to influence the funds rate
question 6 is openended  do you see other nonstandard policy tools besides open market purchases and liquidity facilities as likely to be particularly helpful in current circumstances  if so what are those tools
question 7 returns to governance issues  given that the desk has begun to purchase agency debt and mbs how should the fomc specify its directive to the desk  if the committee instructed the desk to undertake purchases in order to attain specific objectives for interest rate levels or rate spreads serious practical issues could arise  longerterm yields are heavily affected by expectations of future policy rates which are in turn importantly driven by incoming economic news as well as by various risk premiums  experience indicates that our operations have an effect on longerterm yields but to have an effect that is economically significant the
operations may need to be very large  even then given the substantial effects of the other factors that affect yields it might be very difficult or impossible to achieve specified rate levels or spreads  as an alternative the committee could instruct the desk to purchase specific quantities of particular types of obligations  such an approach is clearly feasible but its potential benefits may be harder to communicate to the public except in qualitative terms  another issue is whether the directive should be conditional on market developments  the bluebook provided drafts of directives in which the basic approach is to specify quantities of purchases over specified periods of time but with some allowance for qualitative judgments about market conditions
question 8 comes back to communication issues  if the committee embarks on the use of unconventional policy tools clearly communicating the nature of the policy and the intended objectives will be challenging  for example once the committee has formally brought its target for the federal funds rate to around zero or otherwise has signaled that further rate reductions will not be forthcoming there will surely be press stories asserting that the committee has run out of ammunition potentially undermining the committees message that monetary policy still can provide considerable stimulus  overcoming these communication challenges will be somewhat easier if the committee is able to agree on the substance of what it is trying to accomplish and a broad approach to explaining it to the public  but achieving such agreement is complicated by significant remaining uncertainties about the effectiveness of the various unconventional policy tools a very uncertain economic outlook and other factors  in your remarks you may wish to provide your views of the best practical means for the committee to address these communication challenges  thank you  we would be happy to respond to your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  i would like to give special thanks to
the staff some of whom are here and some of whom are not for an extraordinary amount of work
on these difficult topics over a short period of time  we very much appreciate those efforts
are there questions for brian or steve or anyone else  if there are no questions were ready
for the goround on this topic  id like to ask your indulgence  theres an awful lot here and id
like to go first this time and try to clear out some underbrush and to lay down some issues in the
hope that it will perhaps focus our discussion a bit more
as you know we are at a historic junctureboth for the us economy and for the federal
reserve  the financial and economic crisis is severe despite extraordinary efforts not only by the
federal reserve but also by other policymakers here and around the world  with respect to
monetary policy we are at this point moving away from the standard interest rate targeting
approach and of necessity moving toward new approaches  obviously these are very deep and
difficult issues that we are going to have to address collectively today and tomorrow  i want to say
that although we are certainly moving in a new direction and the outlines of that new direction are
not yet clear this is a work in progress  the discussion were having today is a beginning  its not
a conclusion  everyone can rest assured that this conversation is going to continue for additional
meetings and today were not going to be setting in stone an approach that will be used indefinitely
in fact it would be hubristic to do so given all the uncertainties and changes that we face  im not
going to try to address all of these questions but i thought it would be useful for me to talk a bit
first about nontraditional policies and then second about the important issue of governance which
i know a lot of people are concerned about
so let me start first with nontraditional policies  i want to note that we are working and we
should continue to work to improve our control of the effective funds rate  the interest rate paid on
reserves is not currently sufficient to keep the rate at the target  thats for a lot of reasons with
which you are all familiar  i would just note that the staff is still working  we should not give up
on that  the interest rate on reserves may be more effective as people get used to it as balance
sheet constraints ease and as the rate gets higher if we decide to raise rates  so i think that is still a
tool that we should keep and be aware of  there are other strategiesopening term accounts of
various kinds taking steps to encourage arbitrage using treasury bills or perhaps issuing our own
bills  in fact we have had a lengthy discussion in this committee of alternative structures for
implementing monetary policy that involve different ways of setting up reserve requirements
so first of all lets just acknowledge that although we are not keeping the effective funds
rate at the target currently we should not assume that thats always going to be the case  we do
have some optionality in that direction  that being said its obvious that the effective funds rate
now is quite low and given the amount of excess reserves in the system were going to have to find
other ways at least in the near term to address the economic crisis  one approach as was discussed
by steve and others is communications  here in particular i think we are at early stages  i dont
think were going to come to any conclusions today  there is a lot of interest in terms of
possibilities  the one thing i would say is that if we do use communications as a way of providing
information about future policy moves we should be very careful to make those interest rate
forecasts if you will conditional on the state of the economy  it should be very clear if we give
forward guidance of some kind that the evolution of the policy rate will depend on how the
economy evolves  the more clarity we can provide in that direction the more effective our policy
will be and the less problem we will have exiting from that strategy in the future
the statements that were circulated in the bluebook gave two examples just for discussion
both of them in alternative a  in paragraph 2 there was some suggested language for using an
inflation target as a way of managing expectations  let me just read the sentence  in support of its
dual mandate the committee will seek to achieve a rate of inflation as measured by the price index
for personal consumption expenditures of about 2 percent in the medium term  the idea there
would be to try to stabilize inflation expectations avert deflationary expectations and keep real
rates lower than they otherwise would be  the 2 percent in that statement is a placeholder
obviously if we do this we would have to talk more about what 2 percent means  is it a permanent
level  is it a temporary number  but that is one strategy
i would add that of course as we have discussed adopting what might be a de facto
inflation target is a pretty big deal and if we decide to do that i would like to have some
opportunity to consult with the congress appropriately  but if we decide to go in this direction i do
think that this might be a good time because it is certainly not a negative as far as employment
growth is concerned in this context and so it might be easier to explain
the other example of communication also in alternative a ties policy to economic
forecasts  the committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant federal
funds rates near zero for some time  i note that this is a forecast of policy rather than a
commitment to policy but it does provide some information about the committees expectations
and should affect market rates  so again i think were at early stages of this particular approach
but it may be promising and i hope todays discussion will provide some insight
the second general approach to conducting nontraditional monetary policy is by use of the
balance sheet  we have already begun to do this to some extent as you know  in some respects our
policies are similar to the quantitative easing of the japanese but i would argue that when you look
at it more carefully what were doing is fundamentally different from the japanese approach  let
me talk about that a bit  the japanese approach the quantitative easing approach was focused on
the liability side of the balance sheetspecifically the quantity of bank reserves the monetary base
or however you want to put it in the system  the theory behind quantitative easing was that
providing enormous amounts of very cheap liquidity to banks as steve discussed would encourage
them to lend and that lending in turn would increase the broader measures of the money supply
which in turn would raise prices and stimulate asset prices and so on and that would suffice to
stimulate the economy  again the focus of the quantitative easing was on the liability side and
indeed there were targets as you know for the amount of excess reserves or reserves in the system
i think that the verdict on quantitative easing is fairly negative  it didnt seem to have a great deal of
effect mostly because banks would not lend out the reserves that they were holding  the one thing
that it did seem to do was affect expectations of policy rates because everyone understood it would
take some time to unwind the quantitative easing  therefore that pushed out into the future the
increase in the policy rate
so i would argue that what we are doing is different from quantitative easing because
unlike the japanese focus on the liability side of the balance sheet we are focused on the asset side
of the balance sheet  in particular we have adopted a series of programs all of which involve some
type of lending or asset purchase which has brought onto our balance sheet securities other than the
typical treasuries that we usually transact in  you are all aware of the lending facilities for banks
and dealers the swaps with foreign central banks the promised purchases of mbs the various
credit facilities for which even i do not know all the acronyms anymore  laughter  in this case
rather than being a target of policy the quantity of excess reserves in the system is a byproduct of
the decisions to make these various types of credit available  i think thats a very different strategy
and bill gave some evidencewe can debate it furtherthat these different policies have had some
effects on the markets at which theyre aimed
again to distinguish between the balancesheet quantitativeeasing liabilityside approach
and the assetside approach that we have been using i do not thinkand i feel this quite strongly
that it makes any sense for us to have or try to describe monetary policy with a single number
which is the size of the balance sheet or the size of our liabilities as the japanese did  there are a
number of reasons for this but the least important reason is probably just the fact that many of our
programs dont have fixed sizes  they are openendedlike the swap programs for example
also many of the programs have different timing different durations maturities beginning points
ending points and the like and so in that respect i think it would be difficult to put in a single
number  more important the programs on the asset side of our balance sheet serve different
purposes and have different structures and aggregating a dollar of mbs purchase a dollar of
commercial paper purchase and a dollar of swaps to make three dollars strikes me as being apples
and oranges  i do not think that is the right way to think about it  furthermore and finally these
programs obviously have different operational costs and risks different risks of losses different
maturities and most important they present different issues with respect to the exit strategy which
we will want to talk about  rather than looking at this as a single number as a measure of the
liability side of the balance sheet i think we ought to think about it as a portfolio of assets a
combination of things that we are doing on the asset side of our balance sheet that have specific
purposes and that may or may not be effective but we can look at them individually
let me turn now quickly to the governance issues  before getting into them let me just say
that whatever difficulties we may have finding appropriate governance it is certainly the case that
the federal reserve act did not exactly contemplate the situation in which we find ourselves today
i think we all agree that getting the right policies for the us economy is the top priority and
whatever we do we need to find a way to get the right policies in place  frankly i think the best
way to achieve thati am going to talk about some detailsis through operating in good faith
if we work together and keep each other apprised of developments and our views we will be
able to make this work  if we take too narrow an approach too legalistic an approach i think it
will be much more difficult
so let me make a few comments  i think i can focus this best by simply answering the
question  if the federal funds rate is at zero and the fomc no longer sets the target then what is
the role of the fomc in monetary policy  i have four answers to that question  the first is that
the federal reserves outlook is the fomcs outlook  that is the fomcs views about the
evolution of the economy of prices and of financial conditions will govern our policy decisions
in particular it is the fomcs outlook that appears in the minutes it is the fomcs outlook that
appears in the projections and it is the fomcs outlook that appears in our communications
therefore if your board members ask you with respect to monetary policy well what are we
doing now the answer is keep telling us what you are seeing in the economy and financial
markets  we will transmit that to the full fomc because the fomcs outlook is the perspective
that governs the policy actions that we take
the second role of the fomc i believe is in the communication policy both in the
narrow and in the large  in the narrow if we decide to adopt a target make a commitment about
the length of time in which we hold rates low or make any other kind of verbal promise in our
statements or in other contexts that is obviously the fomcs prerogative and i think we
understand that thats how it would work
the third area is the most difficult one and that has to do with the balance sheet  the
law provides a kind of odd codependence if you will between the board and the fomc with
respect to the balance sheet  both the board and the fomc are enjoined by the federal reserve
act to pursue the dual mandate and both the board and the fomc have powers that affect the
size and composition of the balance sheet  in particular the fomc has authority over
treasuries agency purchases and swaps whereas the board has in particular the 133
authority which has been utilized a lot lately for credit programs  so we have dual authority
and we have dual or joint responsibility  i think the only way to deal with that essentially is
through close consultation and collaboration  my commitment to you is that we will work
together even more closely even more collegially going forward to make sure that everyone is
on board and understands what we are doing with respect to our various programs on the asset
side of our balance sheet and that each person on this committee is well informed and is able to
give views and input into the discussions that we have
the legal authorities are what they are but i do think that a collective and cooperative
effort can help us solve this problem  in particular i understand that the briefing sessions that i
have provided have been useful  i am willing to commit to do those as frequently as necessary
and i am willing to make them into meetings if we need to have twoway discussions and input
from the committee with respect to policy actions  so it is a bit awkward but i hope that
cooperation will allow us to work together on the balance sheet
now there is a special issue here though which is the unwind issue  one way in which
the balance sheet affects the responsibilities of the fomc is that if the fomc is going to be
raising interest rates at some point in the future clearly it needs to have information and
understanding about the constraints being placed on policy by the size and composition of the
balance sheet  so i think that keeping the fomc as a whole informed about the balance sheet
about the programs about the constraints that may be placed on the unwind and about
alternative strategies for raising rates once the time comes is incumbent upon me and the rest of
the board to do  as a down payment on that i have asked bill dudley if there is time
tomorrow to give you a bit of an update on the talf the assetbacked securities loan facility
and talk to you about some issues that it raises for the unwind and for future interest rate policies
fourth and finally with respect to the fomc responsibilities is communication to the
public  the public doesnt make the distinction between the board of governors and the fomc
the public understands the federal reserve  what we need to do is to come together and decide
what policies we want to pursue and then collectively take responsibility for those policies and
communicate them in a coherent and consistent way to the broad public  that is the
responsibility of all of us and i hope we can work together to provide everybody with the
information that they need to do that effectively  in particular i am going to say that given the
state of confidence in the markets and in the economy i hope whatever disagreements we may
have that as much as possible we can keep them within these walls  with respect to the public
we need as much as possible to communicate a clear strategy going forward
so those are just some thoughts on governance  i recognize the problems  i am eager to
hear your views about how to do it better  i am also interested in knowing how you think these
governance issues should translate into the statements and into the directives  i think we have
thrown out some suggestions there  we are not in any way wedded to them  if other people
have other ideas we are very open to adopting those ideas  but at least i want to say that i am
fully aware of these issues and i think that however many structures we may impose nothing is
going to substitute for a good faith collaborative effort in making this work  let me stop there
and begin the goround with president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  let me echo your comments about the
staffs work  they have provided us with a very comprehensive compendium of research and
experiences relevant to the policy problems that we are facing now  and they have presented it
in a surprisingly digestible form all things considered  laughter  this was no small feat as
you and brian noted given the other demands on the staffs time over the past few months
clearly as you said mr chairman this is a critical moment for the fed and the
economy  whatever we do and say at this meeting is going to mark a discrete change in the way
we have conducted policy and communicated about it to the public in recent years  some of this
change as has been noted is already under way  we exhausted our ability to sterilize the
additional reserves created through credit expansion at about the same time we implemented
interest on excess reserves  beginning with this meeting we have to articulate how we would
intend to conduct monetary policy and pursue the goals of our dual mandate with the funds rate
at a very very low level perhaps zero and perhaps for a very extended period of time
before addressing specifically the questions that brian has laid out for us i want to make
clear what i think is one of the central issues at hand and that is the committees control over
the monetary base and its conduct of monetary policy  when we target the fed funds rate at any
rate above zero we instruct the desk to manage reserves or equivalently the monetary base so
as to keep the effective funds rate at our target  monetary policy has always been about
controlling the base and this continues to be true at the zero lower bound on interest rates  in
fact the path of the monetary base is even more critical at the zero bound because that is how we
prevent deflation  by managing the publics expectations about future base growth and future
inflation we manage current real rates and influence real activity  in essence we prevent
deflation by convincing the public that future base growth will be inconsistent with a falling
price level
just as a thought experiment imagine that we commit to keeping interest rates at the zero
bound for an extremely long time period say infinitely  if we do thatthis is a clear result from
the literatureit does not prevent a deflationary equilibrium  but if we can commit to keeping
the monetary base at a finite level not falling then that does rule out a deflationary equilibrium
so it is key that expectations about the base not just nominal interest rates are vital for our
ability to prevent a deflationary equilibrium
i think that focusing on the monetary base is going to help communication and the
reason is that a lot of people out there might not understand the relationship between credit
spreads and growth or inflation or various other things that we are doing  but in almost
everyones mind is the phrase too much money chasing too few goods  it provides for a lot of
people an intuitive link between money and inflation and i think wefor all the warts of our
policy in the early 1980s under chairman volckerexploited that well to convey to the public
that we were committed to bringing inflation down in a simple intuitive way  i think that can
help us now analogously in convincing the public that we are going to be able to prevent
deflation because we control money
the committees management of the base or bank reserves is distinct in my viewas
you noted mr chairmanfrom the initiatives that use our balance sheet to target specific
financial market spreads  credit market programs may have macroeconomic effects  indeed
that is their intended effectto have beneficial macroeconomic effects on growth and inflation
it is the same as other fiscal policy initiatives that also may have macroeconomic effects  but
they are not monetary policy and i think that is fairly clear
this committee i take it as given is responsible for monetary policy  at the end of the
day monetary policy is about controlling the monetary base or bank reserves  from the point of
view of fomc policy what is important about the nonstandard tools and credit market programs
is their effect on the monetary base  again to make this contrast stark a policymaker
controlling spreads cannot prevent deflation  a monetary policy maker controlling the base can
i should note that the ability to pay interest on reserves means that we face this issue generically
whether or not the funds rate is zero because now with interest on reserves we can vary the
monetary base independently of how we vary the federal funds rate  this makes it even more
important that we make this transition in a way that clarifies the committees role
turning now to brians questions i think the most important one is number 7 the one
about the directive to the desk  i believe that if the directive is not going to specify a numerical
target for the funds rate then we need to find a way to specify some numerical target or range for
the growth in the monetary base or the growth in bank reserves  now i realize that the directive
is to the desk which has control over the soma account and under a strict constructionist
interpretation that doesnt necessarily equal the quantity of the monetary base  in fact the
discrepancy has gotten fairly large now with all of these credit programs  but if the committee
doesnt provide direction about the interest rate that is fixed at a floor and if the committee
doesnt provide direction about a monetary aggregate the committee really isnt doing monetary
policy in my view  the committee can also choose specific asset categories for the desk to buy
for the system open market account but that shouldnt be confused with monetary policy as
long as the monetary base is being determined at the margin by our credit programs  to put it
slightly differently individual reserve banks can propose their own credit programs subject to
the board of governors approval  but if they want to monetize those assets then i would
expect that the committees prior approval would be required if an alteration in the base target
were needed  that is what i would propose for the directives
question 8 flows directly from question 7  what we should communicate is that we are
targeting a quantity of the monetary base or bank reserves and this communication should be
made in a way that is broadly similar to the way we talk about interest rate policy stating that
our goals are for growth in the monetary base that supports the achievement of sustainable real
growth and our mediumterm goal for inflation
question 3 also deals with communication but more from the point of view of the funds
rate path  i think in the present environment we should communicate that we anticipate that it
will be near zero for some timeor something to that effect  regarding part b of question 3
instead of citing the risk of deflation i think we should presume some measure of success and
communicate that we intend to use the growth of reserves to minimize the risk of inflation
running below our mediumterm inflation goal  regarding part c i think we should stick to
communicating our goals for inflation
questions 4 and 5 are about the means by which we grow our balance sheet and the
monetary base and i think the committee should strive to maintain as much distance as possible
from credit allocation  to me that means trying to have as little effect as possible on relative
prices among nonmonetary assets and i say that because i dont think we really know enough to
secondguess those outcomes  so i would like to see us focus on longterm treasuries
let me close with a few remarks about the committee  in the 1920s each individual
reserve bank made open market operation decisions on its own in an uncoordinated way  that
proved ineffective and at times we were operating at crosspurposes one reserve bank selling
while another was buying  in response the conference of presidents formed the open market
investment committee to coordinate our decisions and make all the purchases through the good
offices of the federal reserve bank of new york  but the role of the board of governors in that
committee was unclear  in fact the board at times tried to order the open market investment
committee to do things that the presidents didnt want it to do and they came to an impasse
this was remedied with the legislation of the 1930s that created the federal open market
committee
now we do things that werent envisioned then thats for sure  but surely the guiding
principle there was that they wanted one single governance body in the federal reserve system
to be responsible for the monetary conditions in our country and i take that to be the guiding
spirit of the fomc as well  this is the only body in the federal reserve system in which we all
come together as one and subject ourselves to the discipline of listening to each others different
views and forming a workable consensus on the way forward  i agree mr chairman that we
shouldnt be splitting hairs about legal niceties about who is responsible for what  i agree
wholeheartedly that we should work toward consensus for that and that is why i think the
committee has to have a serious role in monetary policy  i dont think that focusing the
committees decisions on just what the system open market account does and leaving all these
other programs to have whatever affect they might on the base is the right way forward  thank
you
chairman bernanke  i wont try to respond but i do want to ask you what your
interpretation of the japanese experience is  they had enormous increases in the base no
increase in m1 and no inflation
mr lacker  first let me say that there are models and sets of policy rules under
which in the short run there is an irrelevance proposition a kind of modiglianimiller theorem
about exchanges of monetary assets for shortterm liquid securities that are virtually perfect
substitutes and at the zero lower bound are definitely perfect substitutes  so that is definitely
true  the point i made about the base in the long run is true as well  it has to do with
eliminating certain possible conjectures that the public might make about our willingness to
tolerate deflation  in the japanese case they were widely known to be quite eager to lift interest
rates  it was known that they viewed the problems in the banking sector as exacerbated by low
interest rates  they thought that raising real interest rates would provide more discipline and
force more restructuring in the banking system  so they continually had to fight to keep the long
end of the yield curve down  i dont view that experience as providing the best evidence about
what a firm commitment to preventing deflation could be
chairman bernanke  president fisher you had a twohander
mr fisher  yes sir  i just want to ask a questionagain acknowledging that i am
the least well educated on this subject matter and not as erudite in my understanding  so this is a
tutorial question  what we have been doing is implicitly acknowledging that standard monetary
tools are not as effective as they could be because of the financial frictions that we have
encountered in the marketplace  so we have been targeting dealing with those financial frictions
my question president lacker is just from an educational standpoint  do we know how much
monetary base or balance sheet expansion would be needed to bring credit spreads back into
normal order or to deal with these financial frictions  if we are going to target the monetary
base i worry about the operational consequences of doing so since it seems to me that is an
openended question  that is my question
mr lacker  that is a very good question  we dont have any models to draw on
because we dont have any data that would allow us to uncover a structural relationship between
spreads and the quantity of the base  in any event even were we to focus solely on our primary
objectives for growth and inflation i think we would have trouble there  i think we would have
a great deal of difficulty figuring out a quantitative relationship between the monetary base at the
zero bound and our objectives  but we started the way we usually do thingswithout a serious
quantitative understanding of the relationship between the funds rate and growth and inflation
and we groped and groped and found our way  we are going to grope and try to find our way in
this new regime and we are going to have to think hard about it and make some guessesby
trial and errorjust the way we learned how to do funds rate targeting
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i too want to add my praise to the staff  it
was an extraordinary set of memos as jeff indicated making reasonably clear very difficult
literature on a complex topic  so i want to thank them  reading through them was very helpful
to me in trying to sort out some of my own views as well
as we know the nominal funds rate has been trading well below our target  it is near
zero  the real funds rate is about minus 2 percent  the outlook for growth is now even weaker
than it was before  in that case we would want our policy rates to decline with the equilibrium
real rate  but the zero bound of course may constrain us and our ability to do that is
complicated by the prospect of declining inflation expectations which make more difficult our
ability to let the funds rate fall  once we are in the situation in which our policy rate is
effectively zero it does become a constraint on monetary policyas has been well explained  in
that case theory suggests that our policy strategy must focus on ways of raising expectations of
inflation so that near the zero bound real rates can decline while nominal rates remain close to
zero  one way to implement such a strategy is to credibly commit to keeping policy
accommodative for some period of time after the funds rate is no longer constrained by the zero
bound and before moving policy back to more neutral rates thereby raising expectations of
inflation  eventually however we would need to bring policy rates back up in line with
economic conditions to avoid a permanent increase in longrun inflation expectations  that will
be a tricky task to be sure  what we promise to do with policy in the future is of overriding
importance in this framework
now i am sympathetic to this theoretical analysis but i have some concerns as well
the models that deliver these results are models of full commitment and thus presume that
policymakers have already in some sense credibly committed to deliver on an inflation target and
to deliver this strategy in the event that the nearzero bound becomes binding which in these
models amounts to having a pricelevel target as opposed to an inflation target  i would like to
think that we are committed and credible policymakers as far as the public is concerned but
frankly i have my doubts  i would feel more comfortable if this committee had agreed to a
wellarticulated inflation target  had we done so the current task before us might have had a
greater chance of success
unfortunately we do not have that luxury  consequently i am somewhat less confident
of how the public and the marketplace will react to our efforts  the trick we face now is how to
make these promises understandable and credible  one difficulty is that the optimal policy for
many models in these circumstances is very complicated and very difficult to understand much
less communicate  if we hope to affect expectations we need to explain our policies in a way
that the public can understand  even approximation of optimal policy in these circumstances
would involve pricelevel targeting as i said and it would be very difficult to explain
particularly since the fomc has never formalized its inflation target let alone a pricelevel
target  i think we would be better off trying to communicate something simpler  first we need
to tell the public that we have lowered the funds rate as low as we think it is beneficial to go
i do have some concerns about lowering the target rate all the way to zero  we still do
not understand why having interest rates on reserves isnt working to keep the funds rate at its
target and there may well be unintended consequences of moving our target to zero beyond
those well articulated in the boards staff notes  whether that lowest rate is 100 basis points
75 basis points 50 basis points or 25 basis points is very hard to say  however given the law of
unintended consequences and our lack of experience at the lower bound in this country i do not
want to go all the way to zero  but i think we do need to communicate clearly to the public that
when we reach whatever that effective zero rate is we are done  a way of communicating that
might be by giving a funds rate target or range say between zero and some percent
there are two additional practical advantages i see that argue for bounding our target rate
above zero  first it will allow additional time for banks to become more proficient at managing
their reserves so that our interestrateonreserves regime can become effective  by going to
zero we will effectively shut out that learning process  second i believe that when the time
comes to raise rates even by modest amounts we will be in a better position to do so from a
nonzero position than from a zero position  next we need to communicate that the fomc
desires inflation rates that are higher than perhaps our longrun target and communicate an
inflation range we are aiming for  that is somewhat difficult because we have refused to
communicate such a target in the past  we certainly need to communicate that we do not wish
deflation in a very weak economy  we also may wish to convey that we are going to keep the
nominal funds rate low for some period of time because we desire higher inflation and that
currently seems to be expected  communicating this serves to increase commitment and it also
limits misunderstanding when inflation rates might temporarily be above a longerrun target
thus i think we need to say ex ante that we desire higher inflation rates than currently  as
suggested earlier this would be easier to communicate had we adopted a target earlier
regarding the use of nonstandard policy toolsin my view we are already there  with
the funds rate trading below target we are effectively conducting monetary policy through
quantitative easing which i define as increases in reserves either by open market operations or
by any other means  indeed expansion of our balance sheet including unsterilized lending is
monetary policy as it is monetizing the debt either public or private  as an aside i find the
description of such a policy as nonstandard a bit peculiar since using balance sheet quantities as
instruments of policy has had a long tradition in monetary policy  indeed even the federal
reserve has targeted nonborrowed reserves at various points in its history  in principle i have
no objections to quantitative easings of this form  but if that is how we view the new regime
then we need to publicly acknowledge that we have changedthat we have a new instrument
and communicate how monetary policy will be determined going forward
internally we also need to resolve as has been pointed out how decisions about our
lending and liquidity facilities will be made particularly now that these have become the main
instrument of monetary policy as opposed to being the mechanism for providing liquidity to
improve market functioning which is then sterilized  the fomc and not only the board of
governors needs to be involved in decisions about the magnitude of such lending and the choice
of assets  in effect these are choices about the extent of the feds balance sheet and its
expansion or contraction
there are a number of ways in which one might proceed  first i believe we need to
publicly convey that we have entered a new regime  otherwise it may look as though we have
lost control of monetary policy or that the fomc which sets the target funds rate and the board
of governors which largely is controlling the liquidity provisioning are at odds  one obvious
step would be to change the directive to the desk which is released in the minutes in a way that
clearly indicates that the new regime is now operative and that the fomc has deliberately
chosen to be in that regime  we would then have to communicate something about the size of
the balance sheet going forward in terms of limits ranges or maximums of some form such as
president lacker was suggesting  my preference is for the directive to specify objectives in
terms of asset quantities rather than the level of nonfundsrate interest rates or interest rate
spreads  that is question 7 of the staff memo  these latter two are not under our control and
even more so than before reflect counterparty risk not liquidity impairments  moreover the
transmission mechanism from reserve quantities to rates and spreads is not precise enough for
these to be operational objectives
setting a quantity limit on the size of the balance sheet is more familiarsimilar to our
experience with operating a reservesbased target  in this quantitative regime it means that the
board of governors wishes to implement new lending programs that expand the balance sheet
that is that are not sterilized  the board of governors would have to seek approval of the
fomc to get such an expansion but not necessarily for the composition of the assets
as i have articulated before i believe we need to remain cognizant of the line between
monetary policy and fiscal policy  i would prefer to see us purchasing treasuries rather than
riskier assets as i would favor the purchases of longterm treasuries over new 133 facilities
this refers to questions 4 and 5  to the extent that some of our lending programs are targeted at
aiding specific markets my preference would be to shift those assets from the feds balance
sheet to the treasury and substitute treasury securities  this would help distinguish monetary
policy from credit policy and preserve our ability to conduct independent monetary policy
we also need to recognize that as the economy begins to recover these programs will
need to be unwound and this may occur before all financial institutions are fully recovered
some of our facilities have termination dates and will shrink naturally as those dates are reached
but others like the agency mbs programs or the talf will complicate the problem  under a
wellfunctioning corridor system should we get there the target rate will be somewhere between
the upper and lower bounds and we will have to shrink the balance sheet if we expect to hit our
target  the reduction may be quite significant if it is accompanied by a general fall in the
demand for reserves by banks
even if we imagine going to a floor system in which in principle we can raise the target
rate without shrinking the balance sheet we need to be concerned about the health of our balance
sheet so that we can ensure that we can finance the interest rates on reserves and pay them  note
that if we do go to a floor system the rate paid on excess reserves will become our instrument
and we will need to agree on how to set that rate going forward  in my view that rate should be
decided by the fomc
in summary under a quantitative easing regime the magnitude of the quantitative easing
should be an fomc decision  to the extent that the quality of assets on our balance sheet
complicates future monetary policy decisions the asset makeup of the feds balance sheet
should also be in the fomcs purview  one option that has been discussed is for the fed to
issue its own debtother than federal reserve notes i assume  i am uncomfortable with this
proposal  it is likely to require congressional approval and oversight will no doubt be sought
since the feds securities will be public debt  this potentially generates opportunities for the
congress to control our debt ceiling and perhaps the pricing of our securities in ways that may
limit our ability to conduct independent monetary policy  thus i am very skeptical that this
would be a good path to follow  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  this is an extremely important discussion
and i am glad that you have arranged a special session  i very much appreciate the
comprehensive and outstanding memos from the staff  at our october meeting we agreed to
take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery of the economy and that principle
guides my thinking on monetary policy at the zero bound  in most circumstances i see few
advantages to gradualism and certainly whenever we approach the zero bound i think the funds
rate target should be quickly reduced toward zero
as to the level of the lower bound my default position is that we should move the target
funds rate all the way to zero because that would provide the most macroeconomic stimulus  for
example every 25 basis point cut in the target typically takes about 25 basis points off the prime
rate and associated borrowing rates  the institutional concerns about treasury fails and
treasuryonly money market funds merit consideration but i dont consider them serious
enough to ban lowering the target to a very low level  still the surprising results we obtained
from paying interest on reserves should make us chary about predicting the reactions of financial
markets to new circumstances so there may be some benefits from allowing the funds rate to
trade between zero and say 25 basis points
let me now turn to the third set of questions on communication strategies  looking
ahead i believe that there could be significant benefits to communicating effectively the
fomcs intentions to hold the target funds rate at a very low level  the japanese experience at
the zero bound suggests that this is one channel that can work and the evidence suggests that our
own guidance that began in 2003 similarly influenced longerterm rates  we learned then
though that it is hard to convey the conditionality of such intentions and the multiple influences
on the optimal setting of the funds rate  still i favor trying to include forwardlooking
communication on policy expectations in future fomc statements
we could also consider using the fomc minutes to provide quantitative information on
our expectations  for example we could reveal the funds rate projections that implicitly
accompany our quarterly economic projections publishing ranges and central tendencies of the
federal funds rate along with those for gdp growth unemployment and inflation  the
advantage of this approach is that it would provide a clear future path to the funds rate that is
conditional on the economic environment pertaining to output and inflation relative to our goals
we did discuss this approach before and i remember that a number of you were uncomfortable
with it  but circumstances have changed and there could be particular value now in adding the
federal funds rate to our projections and in fact we could consider a trial run
i believe that in addition to providing guidance on the likely path of future interest rates
we should become more communicative about our longerterm inflation objective to avoid a
decline in inflation expectations as inflation drops over the next few years below desirable levels
one way to accomplish this is to include quantitative information on our longerterm projections
in the summary of economic projections sep as the subcommittee on communications has
recommended  we could go even further to endorse a committeewide longterm inflation
objective although that is something that we would have to further consider carefully  we could
supplement including longerterm projections in the sep with language in the fomc statement
that is akin to that used in 2003 when the committee referred to an unwelcome decline in
inflation  alternative b does take a step in that direction
the bracketed language in alternative a goes further by specifying a mediumterm
committee inflation target  this is a big step and one that deserves thorough debate  there are
theoretical papers demonstrating the potential benefits in a liquidity trap of committing to an
inflation rate after the economy recovers that is higher than we would actually want ex post
because raising inflation expectations lowers real rates thereby stimulating the economy  in
theory by committing to more inflation than we actually want later on we could generate extra
stimulus now  but this strategy requires a strong commitment device because the committee
will have an incentive to renege later on when the economy has recovered  i do understand the
attractions of such a strategy in theory but i am not at all convinced that the benefits would
exceed the costs in practice  it would be enormously difficult to explain and could harm the
feds overall credibility as an institution  moreover it is not only real rates but also nominal
rates that influence housing demand and any increase in longerterm nominal rates triggered by
higher inflation expectations could adversely affect this key sector
let me now turn to the nonstandard policy tools that the fomc and the board have
authorized  i wholeheartedly support the many actions that have been taken to increase liquidity
in the financial system as well as those designed to increase credit availability and lower
borrowing costs  going forward i support both the purchase of agency debt and mbs by the
system open market account and purchases of longterm treasury debt  both existing evidence
and the market response we just saw to the recent announcements and comments concerning
such programs suggest to me that such purchases can push longerterm borrowing rates down
other new programsfor example to improve credit market functioning in a2p2 commercial
paper and in commercial and privatelabel residentialmortgagebacked securitiesare well
worthy of consideration  naturally the potential benefits and costs of each new facility or
program need to be assessed before adoption  formulating the guidance from the fomc to the
desk regarding how these new programs should be described remains a challenge  i think a
possible formulation could have the fomc setting some objectives for levels or movements in
treasury yields or mbs spreads but those open up thorny issues and i think that this is
something we really have to study further
with respect to the fomcs operating regime going forward i oppose switching from a
regime based on targeting of the fed funds rate to one based on a quantitative target for the
monetary base excess reserves or the overall size of our balance sheet  the board or the fomc
or both in my view should consider the merits of each program on its own without any
presumption of paygo  most of you probably recall that paygo was a budget device
employed by the congress to constrain the federal deficit to a target level  in our case an
overarching decision by the fomc about the size of our balance sheet or the monetary base
would force tradeoffs among our various programs to hit that total similar to paygo
imagine however that the commercial paper market were to revive allowing us to
terminate the cpff  excess reserves would decline but that decline would have no negative
effect on economic activity so there should be no presumption that some other program should
be expanded to restore the monetary base to its previous level  theory suggests that when the
monetary base is increased by purchasing conventional soma assets its expansion should have
little or no effect on the behavior of banks or asset prices more generally after the zero bound has
been reached  abstracting from expectational effects the evidence generally supports this view
while the quantity of money is surely linked to the price level in the very long run most
evidence suggests that variations in the base have only insignificant economic effects in the short
or medium term under liquidity trap conditions  this makes the base an inappropriate operating
instrument for monetary policy in a zero bound regime  as japan found during its quantitative
easing program increasing the size of the monetary base above levels needed to provide ample
liquidity to the banking system had no discernible economic effects aside from those associated
with communicating the bank of japans commitment to the zero interest rate policy  i think my
views on this mirror those that you expressed in your opening comments mr chairman
with respect to the directive the version proposed in the current bluebook specifies the
types and amounts of mortgagerelated assets that the desk should buy and the objective of these
purchasesnamely to boost activity in the mortgage and housing markets  language of this
type is consistent with the policy approach i support in which each credit facility program and
asset purchase decision is judged on its own merits according to whether it improves the
availability of credit or lowers its cost thus stimulating the economy  i support this approach to
drafting the directive going forward  it is one way in which the committee communicates the
logic of monetary policy  but i think we do need to go furtheras you emphasized mr
chairmanin providing clear explanations to the public about the objectives of the various
facilities how they work and why they are part of a coherent monetary policy strategy
with respect to governance i endorse the suggestion that you made mr chairman about
how we should proceedthat is to work together collectively to forge and communicate a
consensus view of the entire committee to the public while adhering to the particular
responsibilities that the board and the fomc each have according to our governing legal
document which is the federal reserve act
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i also want to thank the staff for preparing
these memos  they are very stimulating a great discussion of a very difficult topic and i know
it was a lot of work  i also want to agree with the chairman that all comments in this arena are
in the spirit of optimal monetary policy which is the only way i would make any comments here
at the table  what is the best policy  what will get the economy back on track soonest  that is
always what we are trying to think about here  the truth is that there are lots of ways that you
might think about what the optimal policy is so that is what the debate is about
let me begin with the first part of the memo asking for comments saying whether we
should go quickly or gradually to zero  i think the most important element is somehow to switch
away from nominal interest rate targeting once the target approaches zero because at that point
the target just ceases to make any sense and you leave the private sector in the dark about any
signals that they might be receiving about where the committee intends inflation and monetary
policy more generally to be going forward  to go quickly to zero is effectively what we have
already done with respect to the federal funds rate at least in terms of the actual federal funds
rate and if i am reading the greenbook appropriately according to the staff greenbook forecast
it is evidently not going to help very much going forward  i think we did go to zero fairly
quickly here
i do not find the reifschneiderwilliams paper which i know carries some weight
around here very compelling so let me give the brief reasons behind that  for one thing you
are taking a model and you are extrapolating far outside the experience on which the model is
based  that might be a first pass but that is probably not a good way to make policy and i
wouldnt base policy on something like that  there are also important nonlinearities  this
whole debate is about nonlinearities as you get to the zero bound and in my view they are not
taken into account appropriately in this analysis  you have households and businesses that are
going to understand very well that there is a zero bound  it has been widely discussed for the
past year  they are going to take this into account when they are making their decisions so you
have to incorporate that into the analysis  that is a tall orderthere are papers around that try to
do that and many other assumptions have to go into that
the third thing i think is important is that in other contexts gradualism or policy inertia
is actually celebrated as an important part of a successful optimal monetary policy  mike
woodford in particular has papers on optimal monetary policy inertia and many others have
worked on it  in those papers it is all about making your actions gradual and making sure that
they convey some benefit to the equilibrium that you will get  all of a sudden in this particular
analysis when you are facing a zero bound that goes out the window and i dont think that it is
taken into account appropriately in the analysis  also it is thrown out the window exactly at a
time when you might think that the inertia and the gradualism are most important which would
be in time of crisis when you want to steer the ship in a steady way  so i think that we have a
long way to go to understand exactly how to behave near a zero bound and i would not make
policy based on that particular analysis or the subsequent work  but as i stated at the beginning
i think it is a moot point anyway because the effective fed funds rate is trading near zero  we are
there  we have arrived
does the zero bound impose significant costs on financial institutions  in general to this
i would say no as the markets can adjust  more important markets should be expected to
adjust to the optimal monetary policy that we set  we are not in the business of keeping
particular markets working in the particular ways that they have worked in the past  i dont want
to disrupt things so rapidly that we upset the apple cart  on the other hand i think the attitude
should be that given enough time we should expect markets to adjust appropriately  i guess that
is what i think about that issue of going quickly or not
we talked for a minute about communication strategies  three were mentioned in the
memo  the first was to hold the federal funds rate at zero until specified conditions obtain  the
second one was the fomc will act to counter inflation below target and the third one was to
accept higher inflation later  in general i think that the communication idea is important and
valuable to think about in this situation  this is because it plays to the rational expectations
forwardlooking aspect of the behavior of households and businesses  my sense is that the
benchmark forecasting models embodied in the greenbook or in a prominent privatesector
forecast such as macroeconomic advisers may understate these kinds of effects because they
dont completely incorporate the forwardlooking elements probably as much as we would like
that is because it is very difficult to do
so i think that the communication thing is the right idea  but i do not think that
communicating that we intend to hold the federal funds rate at zero until specified conditions
obtain will have much effect because the market already expects that we will maintain the rate at
zero until conditions improve  that strikes me as a way of saying that we have hit our constraint
we are bound by our constraint and so we are effectively doing nothing further  i wouldnt want
to get into that kind of message in the communication game and the communication game is a
tricky one  if we went that route i think deflation would develop  the economy would become
mired in a deflationary trap similar to japans which i illustrated last time  in general my
feeling is that understanding the japanese situation as something like a steady state is more how
we need to think of it  in a steady state the markets are clearing the expectations are consistent
with outcomes and there is no pretense of returning to the previous situation unless you
eliminate that steady state or somehow shock the system out of that steady state  in japan the
policy rate has not been above 1 percent for fourteen years  fourteen years  that starts to sound
to me as though the best way to think about this is that there may be multiple steady states out
there and you may be at risk that the dynamics will send you to the deflationary trap
our understanding about the dynamics of thosei know because i have worked on them
myselfis very poor  exactly how they would work and how you would get coordination on
one versus the other is a very difficult question  that research is in its infancy  but the concept
that you might think about the possibilities in the situation as being multiple steady states should
perhaps be entertained more seriously around the table here
it is much better to say as far as a communication strategy that we are constrained on
interest rates and therefore we are switching to something else  i think a monetary base
reserves or some kind of quantity measure would be fine  the reason you want to do this is that
you want to remind the private sector that we control inflation and that we intend to keep
inflation close to our target  this is a way to tell a story about how you are going to do thata
way to signal to the private sector  so to get the intended effect in the minds of the private
sector you eliminate references to the federal funds target and force them to rethink their views
of monetary policy and rethink what we are doing  of course this has to be done in a reasonable
way  it cant be done in a willynilly way  also all the issues that have ever come up around
this table about monetary targeting and reserves and all the difficulties with that would come up
again  but i think it is a great way to make the switch much as volcker did in 1979 and get the
private sector to reorient to the new reality
so yes it is very important to stress that we will counter inflation below targeti guess
that is the second part of this questionand the idea of well you could say we are going to
accept higher inflation later perhaps much later  although being a theory guy i like that because
you are playing on rational expectations it doesnt seem as credible to me with the private
sector  the way we are looking at it now you would be talking far into the future promising
some more inflationyou know in 2013 we will do 5 percent or something like that  it just
seems too far away to have a lot of effect on our situation right now
let me talk briefly about purchases of agencies and longerterm treasuries  in general i
think this is okay but i do not think we should expect a lot of impact from this  i think the effect
will be marginal  i might remind the committee that the famous operation twist from the 1960s
was generally judged to be ineffective and that is why i think the central banks did not
generally speaking play games on the yield curve in the past  i guess i would prefer agencies to
the longerterm treasuries because of the more direct correlation with the mortgage markets  i
think that might help our case a little in this current situation but i wouldnt expect a lot out of
that policy
expansion of 133 credit backstopsi see this as likely the way policy is going  i think
it is helpful in some circumstances  i would like to see us work harder maybe much harder on
the metrics for success of these facilities and perhaps rework or discontinue facilities that may
not be meeting expectations  we saw some justification here earlier in the report by bill dudley
which i interpret as saying that the goal is to reduce risk premiums from what markets say they
should otherwise be  frankly i am not sure in all cases what the purpose of the programs is  we
have a lot of them out there  we have ideas  we should quantify that  we should be assessing
and then we should turn around and say this one is working  this one is not working  i
would like to see a lot more in that direction  i understand that we havent done it so far because
obviously we are running on all cylinders  we are fighting very hard here  but going forward
that is something we should be thinking about
our other nonstandard tools are useful  again i think we need to reestablish with the
private sector that the central bank controls the mediumterm inflation rate even in environments
where the nominal interest rate is zero  a simple way to communicate this is to start talking
more about reserves the monetary base and the monetary aggregates  again this has to be done
in a reasonable way  we understand that taking out a program is going to change things and we
need to communicate that effectively  we understand that the links between money growth and
inflation may not be exactly what we would like them to be but this is the situation we are in
because our interest rate channel has turned off  so in normal times i would prefer to
communicate in terms of interest rates but that is not the situation that we are in right now
let me talk a bit about the directive to the desk  in my opinion the directive should be
in terms of the quantity of reserves letting the level of the federal funds rate trade as necessary
again not unlike the volcker situation  presumably the federal funds rate would trade close to
zero on average  the prescription to express the directive in terms of reserve quantities has a
long tradition here on the committee  that language was used at least through 1994 if i have it
correct  i remember when i was first in the federal reserve system we would talk about the
degree of pressure on reserve positions and so there is ample precedent inside the system to
work this way  i think that would keep everything working smoothly in terms of governance  i
see no reason not to go in that direction
the introduction of new programs that are intended to have a minimal effect on the level
of reserves as occurred before september of this year would not interfere with the reserves
objective of the committee  others do interfere with that objective and in that case they would
need to be approved here  but my sense of the committee here though i cant speak for
everybody is that i dont think we would have any pushback on that and we would keep the
governance thing very clear if we did it that way  so that would be my preference  i agree with
the chairman that we want the best policy  we want to work in a cooperative manner and i
think that is one way to do it here
when the market turmoil abates then we should begin setting target ranges for reserves
or monetary base growth  once the crisis is past then we can begin setting a federal funds target
again maybe coming back with a range initially for the federal funds rate and then gradually
moving back into the targeting regime which i agree in normal times is a much better way to
communicate policy
let me talk just for thirty seconds on the communication of alternative tools  above all
we have to communicate that we control mediumterm inflation even when nominal interest rates
are zero and that we intend to keep inflation near target  that is the overriding objective in this
situation  otherwise you are going to let inflation probably drift far below target and the
market will be scratching its head about well what are you going to do about it  okay  thanks
very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take fifteen minutes for coffee
and then come back and continue
coffee break
chairman bernanke  president hoenig whenever you are ready
mr hoenig  all right  thank you mr chairman  i would like to start off also by
saying how much i appreciate this  i think it is an important opportunity for us not necessarily to
agreebecause committees are designed to bring different views together and one hopes to
come to consensusbut to hear one another and to feel more comfortable knowing where we are
as we move from here  so i really do appreciate this opportunity
i am going to go through the questions in somewhat the order they were given and let me
begin by discussing the first two questions on policy strategy  the key issues here are how low
to move the fed funds rate target and at what speed  i agree with the view that keeping your
powder dry is no argument for not going immediately to zero  however i think that there are
other good reasons for not going to zero at this time  in fact the condition of the financial
markets is a strong argument for being especially cautious at this juncture about going toward
zero and about how fast if we were to choose to do that
it is clear from the studies at least the way i read the studies that were providedwhich i
would also add were just excellentthat the market dysfunction in some very important markets
including the treasury market increases substantially as you move toward the zero bound  at
what precise level this occurs is not defined but evidence does suggest that it is a genuine issue
indeed markets are clearly showing signs of impairment in that the effective federal funds rate is
trading well below the current target of 100 basis points  it would be unfortunate if our monetary
policy actions were to cause major and avoidable effects on the functioning of these markets
especially with the current fragile state of the financial system and when the benefits as i
interpret them are not obviously significant
i believe we can minimize the damage so to speak in these markets by maintaining the
fed funds target above 50 basis pointsi prefer 100and by taking actions to ensure that the
effective funds rate trades closer to the target over time recognizing where we are starting from
the way to do this of course is to put limits on the size of the current swaps and liquidity
programsi suppose that is as others have said a size limit on the balance sheetto the point
that the desk can begin to sterilize the reserve injections of these other programs  we are not
there i realize but i would like to see that as the goal
turning to question 3 on communication strategies there is evidence that
communications about the future policy path may have measurable effects on interest rates and
other asset prices especially in circumstances where the markets and the central bank have
different views about the future policy path that need to be reconciled  especially in the united
states a statement about the policy path is likely to be more influential on market expectations
than a statement on inflation right now  as to the statement about the policy path it is possible
to have a significant effect on longerterm rates when market views about the policy path differ
significantly from our views and there is credible commitment to keep the target rate low for a
very long period of time  in general i think that it is difficult to construct a very specific
statement that is credible to markets and does not unduly tie the hands of this committee
consequently if the committee decides to adopt language about future policy actions i would
prefer moregeneral rather than morespecific condition statements  i would note that the more
general language we used in 03 through 05 appears to have been more effective than the bank
of japans morespecific conditioning statements during the period of quantitative easing
as to the inflation communications i would be opposed to a statement that suggests that
inflation risks have threatened the dual mandate and that the committee will act to mitigate this
risk  i also expect inflation to come down over the next few months but this reflects
considerable unwinding of temporary factors as we noted elsewhere and the risk of deflation is
modest at this time  i also would be strongly opposed to a statement that suggests that we would
accept higherthannormal inflation rates in the next few years  while such a statement might be
appropriate in a deflationary environment the us economy is not yet at that point  instead our
inflation rate has been higher than acceptable for the past five years i believe in part because of
our willingnessunderstandably but still our willingnessto err on the side of accommodation
in the future should inflation come in very low for a sustained period of time such a statement
about accepting higher inflation might have some benefit in preventing a sharp decline in
inflationary expectations  but in todays circumstances such a statement could lead markets
again to conclude that we would respond very slowly to higher inflation pressure in the future  i
think it would confuse and not actually clarify
on nonstandard policy tools i am okay with expanding the purchase of agency debt and
mortgagebacked securities and longerterm treasuries  right now all in my view are
government guaranteed  however i am not in favor of direct support of private securities
through backstop credit facilities or other procedures  i am of the view that we have stepped far
in the direction of credit allocation and have undertaken actions that are fiscal measures and not
appropriate for a central bank even in a crisis like this  in my opinion the longrun costs to the
economy and the federal reserve of engaging in credit allocation exceed the nearterm benefits
of supporting limited segments of the market  there is a relative price effect  in terms of agency
and treasury purchases i agree that the immediate focus should be on reducing the agency
spreads over comparable treasuries  treasury rates have come down a good deal but agency
spreads have widened  normally private yields move with the treasury rates as we know
however the current crisis has largely broken the usual connection  therefore i dont think that
actions to lower treasury rates further will have much effect on other rates and i would
concentrate more on bringing other rates down  however in the coming months as the
economy begins to recover treasury rates will likely come under upward pressure  to the
extent that markets begin to incorporate a view of the policy path that differs from ours i think
we might want to consider purchases as discussed here of longerterm treasuries at that time or
perhaps altering our communication strategy then
on the form of the directives i would generally favor quantitative targets for desk
purchases  although it will be somewhat difficult for this committee to determine appropriate
quantitative targets i dont think we want to move in the direction of specifying targets for
interest rates or spreads for these other instruments because the exit strategy for these approaches
could be very disruptive for the financial markets
in terms of communicating our use of nonstandard tools if we go that way i think that
the more we say the better for everyone  it is important to articulate the range of options under
discussion and when they are announced it is important to discuss not only how they will be
implemented but also how they would be expected to help in achieving our objectives  right
now confidence is quite fragile as we all know and so it is important that we send positive and
constructive messages and not unduly surprise the markets with our actions
two other issues not directly related  as we talk about our policies going forward i
think we really do need to spend a little more time talking about what it means in terms of the
deleveraging process that is going on  people talk about it freely but i dont think it is clear in
anyones mind and would perhaps affect our actions  also we need to talk about the potential
effects of the fiscal policies that will be unveiled soon  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i add my thanks to the staff for the
excellent summaries particularly those that covered the japanese experience  my reading of that
experience argues for acting aggressively and moving directly to whatever lower bound we
consider the effective minimum  the economic outlook has deteriorated sharply and as i look at
the incoming data and our nearterm forecasts i find it reasonable to expect that we will see
more troubling data by the time of our january meeting
i concur with the greenbook assessment that the outlook calls for a cumulative reduction
of 75 basis points over the next two meetings  at the risk of jumping ahead a little my
preference is to get there at this meeting  if there is an argument for a more gradual twostep
approach it is that more communication is needed to explain the committees strategy and
condition the markets for a zero lower bound policy regime  i was on the receiving end of this
argument at my atlanta board meeting last weekwhich don kohn witnessed as a guestat
which some directors strongly resisted moving to the lower bound without in their view a
clearly articulated statement about how policy will operate going forward  mr chairman in
your speech two weeks ago you made a good effort to prepare the public for the possibility that
the committee may soon have to operate with policy targets that are unfamiliar  but it strikes
me that there is a chickenegg problem of when it is appropriate to lay out the new approach
again i read the japanese lesson as move aggressively but at the same time
communicate very clearly the whys and hows of the policy course  president plosser pointed out
in his memo circulated last weekand i believe president lacker noted last meetingthat we
have at least implicitly entered into a quantitative easing regime already  the fed funds rate has
been trading for some weeks near the level that we are likely to find as the lower bound  i think
we must move to a decision at this meeting on communication strategy independent of whether
or not we move to the lower bound in one step  i dont see that this need is significantly reduced
by delaying the move to the lower bound especially if that destination is inevitable as i believe
it to be
on the question of costs of the zero lower bound policy to markets and financial
institutions in my reading of the analysis and the background memos taken as a whole
maintaining the effective funds rate at a level somewhere near 25 basis points may help avoid
problems in some markets that would otherwise arrive at zero  i think we have to be concerned
that at absolute zero the infrastructure of some markets might atrophy as market participants shift
resources in the direction of operations where profits are more attainable  these concerns might
argue for stating the federal funds rate target in terms of a range and i would support a lower
bound in the range of 0 to 25 basis points
as regards communication strategies to state the obvious financial market participants
would prefer to know as much as possible about the level of rates in a zero lower bound regime
the duration of adherence to that policy and when and on what basis the policy will change  the
committee cant fully satisfy those needs but we can provide assurances that equip market
participants with a clear framework for planning and anticipating change of policy  i think it is
important to communicate that we intend to stay the course with this policy until some
combination of materially improved conditions obtain in both financial markets and the general
economy  that is to say we should indicate that the policy is not shortterm shock treatment to
be quickly reversed unless of course conditions dictate
as regards indicating specific conditions that would inform a change of policy or a
change of course i favor an approach that addresses conditionality in general terms using
language such as the committee intends to hold the federal funds rate target at this level until
such time that it judges conditions are present for material and sustained improvements in
financial market functioning and economic growth  i prefer to reference general economic
conditions rather than to use phrases like near zero for some time as in bluebook alternative b
further i think it is appropriate to reinforce that our policy will be calibrated based on our
longerterm inflation objectives  i am not comfortable with formal statements indicating that the
committee is willing to accept higher rates of inflation than it normally would find desirable  in
my view the goal is to avoid entrenching expectations that deviate too much from our explicit or
implicit price stability objectives in both inflationary and deflationary directions  i think this
goal is best pursued by stating our commitment to mediumterm price stability  this statement
can be in general terms but i would also support the more explicit numerical reference in
bluebook alternative a
as regards more purchases of agency debt agency mbs and longdated treasuries my
view is that open market operations should be conducted in the manner that enhances overall
market liquidity in the most efficient and least disruptive way  this may well be by purchases of
agency debt and mbs beyond the level announced  however to the extent that enhancing
overall market liquidity requires efforts to directly manipulate prices in particular markets
beyond the federal funds market i think we may be better served by developing specifically
targeted facilities to do so
as regards the further expansion of liquidity facilities to date we have attacked
dysfunctional market conditions in the interbank funding market the treasuries market the
commercial paper market the mortgage market and shortly the assetbacked securities market
the more we migrate with these facilities in the direction of general corporate debt and other
nonfinancial issuers markets the more our policy actions involve contentious issues of moral
hazard possible distortion of the necessary process of relative price discovery and the
appropriate division of labor between the central bank and the treasury  i think that we just need
to keep this in mind as new facilities are considered  the extension and broadening of existing
facilities and possibly new facilities may be necessary  i judge that the broad policy of targeted
facilities has been successful to date
regarding nonstandard tools i find myself in agreement with the thrust of president
plossers suggestions  in a quantitative easing regime it makes most sense to express our
directive in terms of a quantitative target  and as regards your comments earlier mr chairman
i tend to look at this target question as a tradeoff between targeting quantities versus prices or
rates and i believe that the quantitative target approach is the correct approach even if we
decide to operate with the common understanding that our shortterm objective is for example
to generate a particular path for longterm treasuries or agency debt  based on my reading of
the literature and history as well as on my own experience i have doubts about our capacity to
reliably control specific relative asset prices at least in markets unlike the federal funds market
where we are the monopoly supplier of the asset being traded  but that does not preclude setting
quantitative targets for the purchase of particular assets and evaluating the appropriateness of
those targets against a variety of outcomes including the interest rates that emerge in those
markets
i am however predisposed toward the line of thinking expressed by president lacker in
his premeeting memo  by choosing to express the directive in terms of the monetary base or
some measure of reserves the decisions of the committee remain in the range of traditional
monetary policy  my conjecture is that a reserve base quantitative directive would help to draw
a clear line between traditional monetary policy decisions in the purview of the fomc and the
enhanced credit policies implemented under 133 authority
let me move to the communication approaches  again internalizing the japanese
experience we will be well served by a significant and coordinated communication effort  our
press statement might be supplemented by an additional explanation of whatever new operational
procedures we adopt followed by a public statement perhaps even a press conference by the
chairman  throughout this crisis we have been provided excellent support in the form of
talking points  these have been a great help to me and my staff in providing accurate and timely
information on the various policy actions taken by the federal reserve  with similar assistance
in this case i think we can collectively commit to providing the sort of common voice on the
facts that will promote public understanding of the direction in which we decide to head  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i too would like to add my thanks to the staff
for an excellent set of memosvery good analysis  i would agree with pretty much everyone
that the economic outlook and financial stress warrant further relief for financial conditions so i
am going to be supporting ultimately further quantitative easing as needed  i have to admit that
i am not quite sure what the most effective form of that easing is  it just doesnt seem obvious to
me  but i certainly embrace your suggestion mr chairman of continuing the regular briefings
and when necessary those should be meetings to affirm certain programs that are on the table  i
agree with all of your comments about how important confidence is
let me turn to some of the specifics of the questions about the standard policy issues with
the fed funds target  with a deep recession looming and inflation receding i see no reason to
keep our fed funds powder dry  there is no reasonable uncertainty at this point about the
deepness of the recession or the financial stress and i think the economy would benefit from
further financial accommodation  because we cant really hit our fed funds target because of the
breadth of our lending programs that are on our balance sheet today i think the damage to the
treasury repo and money market mutual funds is unavoidable at this point
for our policy actions i think that we should continue to communicate in terms of our
objectives  in my opinion this strategy covers most of the issues asked of us  the fed funds rate
will be low for some time under our forecast  i dont think there is much doubt about that and
our forecast helped with that  disinflation risks are part of this outlook and i think that should
be well understood  we can communicate that in our speaking  if our inflation target were
explicit and we talked about it morehigher future inflation expectations than just if it were the
case  percent or lowerthat would be part of the communication calculus  as things stand
our longterm projections may be adequate here but more explicitness in general would be
helpful  it is interesting to me that alternative a encompasses all of these in relatively muted
language  frankly if we are expecting a big impact from that statement i think we need to
include a bold font typeface laughter because i dont think it will be picked up necessarily
but i think it is really well done
in terms of the questions on particular interventions the memos brought forward pretty
clearly that the effect of the interventions depends on the size of the operations and where the
markets are  the memos were very good about talking about individual markets and making me
aware of a number of details but they were often pretty much in isolation of how they would
flow through to other markets  it is not exactly clear to me how important that segmentation or
separation is to achieve the goals that we are hoping for from those interventions  i suppose in
wellfunctioning markets you might expect more of those funds to be flowing across those
markets and so you would be generally providing market liquidity  it would flow around  in the
current situation with more stress there probably is more separation  is that ultimately going to
mean we are more effective  i am not even sure because there is the added stress that has to be
dealt with  so the particular interventions are not exactly obvious to me and portfolio
rebalancing could have implications
in one of them there was a correlation matrixfor a particular size of operation where
agencies are influenced in one way or treasuries are influencedabout when we would see
other prices move around  that is possibly a guide to this leakage  but of course those are
unconditional correlations as i understood them and i am not exactly sure how the exogenous
interventions that we are talking about would translate from those correlations  it is really an
identification problem at some level  my takeaway from that is that i find most comforting the
quantitative easing additions that improve total market liquidity  it seems to me that the
treasury and agency purchases are the safest  when we get into credit allocation we have these
facilities in place and we will probably need to do more  mr chairman you talked about the
unwinding consequences that the committee will have to worry about and i think that they are
also pretty important
last on the nonstandard approaches for quantitative easing and what that means for the
desk i guess this is a harder problem with the dual governance issues than i had really
anticipated  i would have thought that it was relatively straightforwardonce we hit the zero
bound on the funds rate that we would identify that we need to expand the balance sheet  i kind
of like it in terms of the asset side  the committee could authorize a broad range of what that
would mean  we could reaffirm the existing lending programsnot approve them for that is
the role of the boardand point to the important role that they are playing  our statement could
provide guidance on the sizes which would pretty much just be a restatement of the existing
sizes of the programs  but we could provide ranges of how the committee might expect that to
be conducted over the intermeeting period if something arose that required an addition or we
were being briefed on new programs as they were rolled out that could be part of it  all of that
said i accept your good faith approachthe more we talk and the more that we understand this
and are consulted it should be adequate
in terms of communicating to the public under the approach that i just mentioned we
would basically state that the fed funds target is essentially zero because of all of the lending
facilities  wed have some statement about the range of the balance sheet something that is not
supposed to be so constraining but that would be somewhat helpful  the descriptions of the fed
lending programs would be part of thatthey are well doneand the term sheets and we would
reinforce our commitment to the policy mandates that we have in our statements and our
forecasts
so just to conclude i think we can go further down the quantitative easing policy path  i
am not really convinced that this is going to do everything that we are hoping and i am a little
concerned as we get to the point where we have an intense desire to effect more that we might
tend to disagree a little more  but i am confident that we will think it through very carefully
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i want to join the others in thanking the staff
for their work  these are very difficult issues and i think you have brought to bear a lot of what
little information we have on these subjects and have kind of kept me out of trouble for the last
week  my wife thanks you as well  laughter
i think the questions in the first set are largely moot as a number of people have said
we are already close to the zero bound and because i think moving there aggressively under the
current circumstances is the right thing to do i dont have any regrets about that  like president
yellen i came into this situation at least a couple of months ago wondering why zero wasnt
the right lower bound  i recognize the market issues that might obtainsort of as president
bullard said i wonder whether markets wont adjust as we go onbut so close to zero the
difference between 6 basis points and zero isnt going to matter very much  but i think we
ought to keep our eye on how markets are functioning whether they adjust and where we should
be
now once we are at a minimumand i think we ought to get wherever we are going at
this meeting as soon as possible a number of people have said that and i agreewe cant
influence actual expected shortterm rates with our actions  we do need to rely on other methods
to change relative asset priceslongerterm rates relative to shortterm rates private rates
relative to government rates nominal rates relative to expected inflationand that is where the
communications and the size and the composition of the asset portfolio come in  both the
communications and the portfolio actions can be effective and influential but i think we need to
recognize that we are losing our most powerful policy instrument  the effects of these other
aspects of our policies are uncertain and it will require some trial and error to figure out where
we are going
with respect to communications i do think it would be useful to tell people the
conditions under which we expect to keep rates low and the conditions under which we would be
prepared to raise interest rates  i think we can tell them if we think it is going to be soon or if it
is going to take some time  but i agree with your point at the beginning mr chairmanand
president plosser and others said thiswe should emphasize the conditions rather than the time
period  we shouldnt commit to a time path  i think something like this should help longterm
nominal rates better reflect our expectations for the path of policy and could be especially
important if markets come to anticipate a firming before we actually anticipate firming  it could
come into play particularly in the context of some massive fiscal stimulus which seems to be
coming  i dont think we want the effects of that fiscal stimulus diminished or crowded out by
increases in longterm rates that are based on a false assumption about the effect of the fiscal
stimulus on monetary policy
i think being clear about where we want inflation to be over the long run will probably
help anchor inflation expectations a bit betterkeep them from drifting down when inflation
itself is very low and keep real interest rates from risingand thereby reduce the odds of
persistent deflation taking hold  we will have an important opportunity to take a step in that
direction if we agree to our longerterm forecasts in january  as president yellen noted the
subcommittee on communications is recommending that  i think voting on an inflation target
would be a substantially bigger step  that is we would have to reach agreement on that  it
could be a more powerful signal of our intentions and it might become necessary  i certainly
think we ought to discuss it  it has a lot of implications that we need to look at including where
we will be in a couple of years  i think we need to be careful
a number of peopleoutside commentators anyhowhave noted that they thought that
we kept our eye too much on macro variables in the low inflation period and that gave rise to
these assetprice increases  i disagree but i think it is an open question  i have seen comments
from other members of the fomc wondering whether we should look at more than just the path
for consumer prices when we are setting monetary policy  but lets not do something now
without thinking about how it is going to play five or ten years down the road  i also agree with
your point mr chairman about congressional consultation  having an inflation target wont
have any effect if it is repudiated by the congress  as soon as we make it it could have a
negative effect
i think changes in the size and composition of our portfolio can affect relative asset
prices  i guess i think president evans that changes are more likely to be effective at times like
these when markets are illiquid and participants have very very strong preferences for one
sector or another  when private parties seem unwilling to lend to each other substituting
federal reserve credit for private credit can be quite effective  carefully designed programs can
reduce the cost of credit and increase the availability of capital to households and businesses  i
see where we are as a natural extension of where we have been  really since august 2007 we
have been using our balance sheet to try to stimulate credit markets  at first we sterilized that by
selling treasury securities  then we sterilized it by the treasury selling treasury securities
then that program ran out and we thought we could sterilize it by interest on excess reserves
and it didnt work  but i dont think we have crossed a sudden barrier in the last month or two
it is true that the base has begun to rise because we have run out of the other sterilization options
but i do think it is a natural extension of where we have been for a while
that brings me to the monetary base  i find myself more skeptical about the effect of
increases in the monetary base per se than what i hear around the room  such increases i think
are supposed to affect asset prices by inducing banks to substitute into higheryielding assets
give them a bunch of reserves and they substitute into higheryielding assets like loans  but i
wonder how effective that is when shortterm rates dont decline with the increase in the base
because we are pinned at zerothat is we are in a liquidity trapand when banks are reluctant
to expand portfolios because they are concerned about capital and their leverage ratio  so i dont
really understand the channels through which an increase in the monetary base under these
circumstances is supposed to affect economic activity  we have seen a huge increase in the base
over the last couple of months and no effect on the money supply  now that is very short term i
agree  your observation mr chairman was that we saw a big increase in the base in japan  i
agree with president lacker that they werent as dedicated to that as they might have been but i
just dont see any evidence that the base isnt going to be absorbed in a declining money
multiplier rather than an expanding money supply and increased activity  i dont understand the
channels  i think the base as we are setting this out is determined by the people who use our
credit facilities  i think that is very important and i dont want to upset that  so i would be
very very hesitant to restructure the directive in terms of the quantity of reserves or the monetary
base  i would have to understand much better what that means and i wouldnt want to constrain
the use of liquidity facilities with such a restraint
i think the situation in the 1970s and early 1980s was very different  first of all the
october 6 1979 meeting that went to monetary targeting was a natural evolution of a lot of
work that had relied more and more on the money supply as a way of communicating about
policy over time  second it was about constraining inflation holding it down  i do agree jeff
that too much money chasing too few goods is something that people kind of understand  i am
not sure that they understand the oppositetoo little money chasing too many goods or
whatever as a cause for deflation  i think it would be very very difficult to communicate what
that meant and how that was supposed to work  so it is a very different situation than we had
back then
i do think we can help by increasing and directing our asset expansion in particular
directions  we have seen evidence as bill showed us in the mbs and gse purchases and the
commercial paper facility  also i favor the consideration of purchases of longterm treasury
bonds  i think that will help to lower longerterm rates in an environment of large liquidity and
term premiums  i would consider expanding our purchases of mbs and gse debt if it looks as
though they might help bring down mortgage rates  i agree with others who have said that they
would be very reluctant to specify such operations with a rate target because i dont think we can
really control that  so i think that talking about quantities would be much better as we have
done with the mbs  i would also continue to look for other ways to use our discount window to
help restart credit markets or substitute for private markets in which the functioning is impaired
and i would be open to a variety of possibilities
i agree that credit allocation is very uncomfortable for the central bank  we are into that
we have been into that for a while  i wish we didnt have to be there  but i dont see any
evidence that the private sector is going to start lending anytime soon on its own  if i saw that
some of those other markets with which we werent involved and werent likely to get
involvedlike the junk bond market that bill showed us in that chartwere beginning to open
up without our help that would be fine  but nothing is happening out there in the markets that
we are not touching  i dont think that is only because everybody is waiting for us to intervene in
those particular markets because there are a bunch of them that they know we cant or wont
intervene in  so we need to remain open to possible further credit market interventions
this raises very difficult governance issues  our inability to sterilize and the huge
increase in our balance sheet raise very difficult questions about how the board and the reserve
banks together carry out their shared responsibility for achieving the objectives of the federal
reserve act  it is not so much about legalities as it is about how to reach the best decisions and
how best to explain those decisions to the world at large  we have always worked in a
collaborative and cooperative way and i think we need to continue to do that  crisis
management strains the normal collaborative and deliberative mode of federal reserve
operations  decisions get made on short notice often over a weekend but as you said mr
chairman we can work at improving our collaboration  the fomc as a body will continue to
have the major influence on our communications about the outlook the likely path of rates and
the acceptability of the inflation outcome  the key elements in our communications have always
been and will remain under the control of this group and that is a large part of what we will be
doing  i agree that we should when consistent with fulfilling our obligations to protect financial
stability consult more and earlier on liquidity facilities
i hope that we can emerge from this discussion and subsequent ones with an agreedupon
framework for what we are doing and what motivates it under these unusual circumstances  i
think wethe federal reserve system the fomc all of usshould consider issuing an
explanatory document on these matters that we can all agree to  i wrote this before this meeting
now that i have heard the meeting i am not sure it is possible  but i think it might be worth the
effort  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  are you in charge of drafting it  laughter  president
stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me make some comments first about
nonstandard policies then about communication and finally a bit about the balance sheet
governance and so forth  with regard to the nonstandard policies bill dudleys charts 24 and
25 showing the spreads narrowing with intervention and spreads tending to widen elsewhere
seem to make a pretty compelling starting point at least not only for the value of the programs in
place but perhaps for considering additional ones  i guess i am kind of wary about that at this
point  a sentence in one of the staff papers that pertains to thislet me also compliment the
staff for the quality and the volume of what they have produced herecaught my attention  it
is difficult to provide specific recommendations for further intervention at this time in part
because facilities that are most obviously valuable to address current conditions have already
been put in place or are in train  that is one concern i havethat we may be heading toward
diminishing returns  in addition as i think somebody has already observed there is a possibility
that if we carry this too far we interfere with what would otherwise be normal and healthy
market adjustments  some of that is going to have to work its way through  finally one thing
from the japanese experience is the socalled preservation of zombies which whatever you
might say about its shortrun value clearly wasnt of value to the longrun health of the
economy  so my preference as far as nonstandard tools would be to emphasize purchases of
longerterm treasuries and of gses and mortgagebacked securities  at least at this point that
is where i would want to put my emphasis
with regard to communication as i think president evans said reiterating our longerrun
objectives indicatinggiven conditions as we perceive and expect themthat the funds rate is
likely to remain low for a considerable period of time or alternatively that reserve provision is
going to remain generous however we want to say it is acceptable  there could be some value
if we can get there in specifying an inflation target and certainly the effort to provide longer
term steadystate forecasts will work in that direction  i think we need to be a little careful
though as governor kohn suggested to think through a variety of issues that are associated with
this  i can even imagine that even if we were to agree on an inflation target and even if the
congress had no objection it might be a bit of a distraction at this point and there could be a lot
of debate external to the system whether it is the right target and why or why not and so on and
so forth  of course that is not our principal concern at the moment
with regard to the balance sheet and governance issues i certainly can get comfortable
with the consultative collaborative approach you described  there might be some value from a
credibility point of viewi put this more as a question than a conclusionin trying to specify
some numerical range for the base reserves or something in that the public could monitor
whether in fact we are doing what we say we are doing  to the extent that we are concerned
about the possibility of excessive disinflation or of deflation this would be a way for the public
not only to take our word for it but also to monitor that in fact we were conducting policy in a
way consistent with that  president lacker in his discussion indicated that emphasizing the
base was a way to emphasize at least in the longer run that we werent intending to let inflation
get too low  i put this as a questionthis could be a way of helping credibility because the
public could monitor it  thank you
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i would also like to join the chorus of people thanking the staff in
particular the staff members who were working on the memos on japan  having done some work
on japan myself i know that getting the institutional details right is far from easy particularly when
you are not a native speaker  so i much appreciated the work in that area
the probability of a severe economic downturn accompanied by deflation is too high and
the effective fed funds rate is already very close to zero  this combination calls for aggressive
nontraditional policies  my reading of the parallel japanese experience highlights two general
principles  the first is one that president stern highlighted  there is a macroeconomic impact from
what we do in bank supervision  banking problems should be addressed expeditiously with
realistic writedowns of problem assets and recapitalization of problem banks  in particular we
should prevent perverse incentives where problem borrowers are supported while healthier
borrowers are starved for credit as banks try to satisfy balance sheet constraints and avoid further
loss recognition  second monetary and macroeconomic policies to address financial dislocations
should be proactive and forceful rather than released gradually over an extended period of time  in
the context of the questions that we have been asked to address id like to encourage us to take
three actions
first i would explicitly state that the committee seeks to achieve a core pce inflation rate
of 2 percent in the medium term  for the second time this decade we are approaching the zero
nominal interest rate bound  setting too low an inflation target threatens to place us in our current
predicament too often  in contrast by setting an explicit target at 2 percent we will indicate our
resolve to take nontraditional policies necessary to achieve that goal  because the inflation target
adopted under the current circumstances would be designed to raise inflation expectations and
stimulate the economy this may be a particularly propitious time to adopt such an explicit target  a
2 percent target would also be consistent with our own revealed preference as the core pce inflation
rate has averaged 194 percent very close to 2 percent over the past ten years
second during the past recession 30year conventional mortgage rates reached 5 percent
the current rate has been hovering at 5 percent and has reached that level only since we
announced our program to purchase 600 billion in gse debt and mortgagebacked securities  the
housing sector remains the epicenter of our problems  given the current outlook i would suggest
using facilities to move toward an interest rate target for example by reducing by 100 basis points
from current levels the conventional 30year mortgage rate  lowering the 30year conventional
mortgage rate would reduce the cost of purchasing new homes encourage refinancing by those with
sufficiently high credit scores and equity in their homes and support fiscal policies that are targeted
at moretroubled homebuyers  it would help troubled and healthy homeowners stimulate the most
distressed area of our economy and help financial institutions exposed to problems in housing
such a target would be understandable to the general public and actions already taken have made
some progress in this area and serve as an example  i would focus on the mortgage rates rather than
the treasury yield curve because lower treasury rates seem to be having little effect on rates paid
by households and businesses and the desire to avoid credit risk has already brought 10year
treasury rates to lows not seen in most recent recessions
third our facilities for shortterm credit have been successful  shortterm commercial
paper rates have fallen as a result of our programs as was highlighted by bill dudley and the
rollover risk at the end of the year has been mitigated by the commercial paper program
increasingly however i have been hearing complaints about banks pulling lines of credit when they
are up for renewal primarily because the banks are facing balance sheet issues  one possible
remedy might be to extend our commercial paper facility to highly rated firms for longer maturities
than are covered by the commercial paper market  all three suggestions would be easily
communicated and understood by the public would address directly the areas of the economy in
which financing has become particularly difficult and would highlight our resolve to avoid a
deflationary economy such as japan experienced for over a decade
i would just end with the note that i agree with the governor kohn on the monetary base for
two reasons  the first is that i do not think our facilities have been particularly well designed to set
a quantitative target  many of the facilities are open ended  go through the following thought
experiment  suppose a money market fund once again breaks the buck  the amlf will probably
go up 150 billion or 200 billion  i would expect the commercial paper facility to go up  i would
expect that most of the bank facilities would also go up  if we were limited by a quantitative target
at the very time that we actually want those facilities to be expanding we would be constrained  i
do not think that is a good idea in the current situation  the second reason comes from my reading
of what happened in japan and this goes to some of the remarks that the chairman made  the
monetary base in japan did expand very rapidly  when banks are capital constrained expanding
reserves very rapidly does not translate into an expansion of the broader balance sheet  so we could
very easily see a situation in the united states in which banks continue to be capital constrained for
some time  despite increasing the monetary base we might not see an expansion in terms of other
assets  that is exactly why i agree with the chairman that we should be focused on the asset not
the liability side of the balance sheet
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also want to start by thanking the staff for
the excellent background materials they provided  while i certainly wish we were not in this
circumstance i do think that this is a critical conversation for us to be having at this meeting and
the background materials were extremely helpful  i am going to proceed directly to the questions
that brian provided as i believe they cover the major issues well  i have some general answers to
the questions but i think that we are going to be learning a lot in the process of implementing
policies into ever more uncharted waters
on the question of whether the committee should quickly move the target fed funds rate
toward the zero bound or get there more gradually i strongly support moving quickly  i agree with
the memos that the japanese experience points to the value of moving aggressively  also we have
already moved beyond the targeted fed funds rate as many have commented and so we are merely
confirming a reality
on the questions pertaining to the costs to financial markets or institutions and the limits to
our rate reduction i think the notes covered very well the costs to some money market funds
bankers in my district have also expressed concerns about additional margin squeezing that they
will face with a lower fed funds rate  so yes there are significant costs to financial markets and
institutions  however i believe that the current environment and our need to allow the fed funds
rate to trade close to zero trumps these costs and in my view a 25 basis point fed funds rate is an
appropriate minimum
regarding the question about the communication strategy i think another lesson that we
have learned from the japanese experience is the role of effective communication and the role of
anchoring inflation expectations  so i do see the benefit in communicating that the federal reserve
intends to hold the target fed funds rate at a very low level until specified conditions are obtained
and that the committee sees a sizable risk that inflation in the coming quarters could be appreciably
lower than is consistent with price stability  i also see that there may be some value to
communicating that our policies might result in a temporarily higher inflation rate in the future both
to indicate this possibility and to signal a willingness to make sure that the risk of deflation
dissipates before we alter our course  although we have not adopted a formal inflation target i do
believe that the release of our longerterm projections as suggested by the subcommittee on
communications will be helpful in managing inflation expectations
moving to questions 4 and 5 regarding nonstandard policy tools my own preference is for a
mixed strategythat is some direct treasury and agency purchases and some expansion of our
private asset purchases using the talf  i support your view mr chairman that we should keep
our focus on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet  i think we should consider increasing
the purchase of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities beyond the levels that we have already
announced  i also see advantages in initiating largescale purchases of longerterm treasury
securities  these actions should help to lower interest rates across a broad spectrum of longerterm
assets  as we have talked about direct purchases also fit more naturally into the fomcs
governance structure whereas the talflike approach is more awkward to fit into the fomcs
purview  as some have commented direct purchases might expose our system open market
account to some capital losses but that seems an acceptable risk for monetary policy in such a
challenging environment
i do think that the focus of our fomc meetings next year should be on evaluating and
adjusting the composition and size of our purchase of securities in response to changing economic
conditions so that the directive need not build in explicit conditioning on market and economic
circumstances  further expansion of our credit backstop facilities under section 133 is also likely
to be beneficial in current circumstances  i think the cpff has been a helpful addition to our
facilities and i am hopeful that the talf will be equally effective  so in summary i favor
applying all of these approaches and remaining flexible  i also believe that a clear starting point on
how the committee would formulate its directive would be to direct the desk to purchase specific
quantities of assets  as a formal matter we might need to include up to in our directive language
but we should anticipate that the desk would be successful in meeting that objective  i think that
the uncertainty surrounding the effects of our actions makes longerterm interest rates or spreads too
unreliable to be communicated as targets
finally on the question of effectively communicating nonstandard policy tools i liked the
language in some of the bluebook alternatives for our policy options  however because of the
historic nature of implementing nonstandard policy tools i think that a good communication plan
should also include a formal press conference or a speech in which mr chairman you announce
the changes  that would serve to emphasize the change in our procedure and eliminate some of the
uncertainties about the role of the fed funds rate target  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president cumming
ms cumming  thank you  again id also like to thank the staff for the excellent notes
its useful to start out with our nearterm goals as most of us have done to provide stimulus and
support for the economic recovery and to prevent too large a fall in inflation  the root problems i
think are worth focusing on for a second  insufficient global demand hurdles to economic activity
from a severely impaired financial system and as ill report tomorrow behavior that is influenced
by confusion and fear among businesses and households that are tending to reinforce the downward
trend of the economy
that environment i think gives us some goalposts to look for in terms of framing the
strategy  i find very appealing marvin goodfriends characterization of the duality of the central
banks policy  we have a monetary and what he calls a credit policy at the same time  in normal
times setting the fed funds rate influences financial conditions especially credit markets in a fairly
predictable manner and this committee from time to time has discussed where overnight rates and
financial conditions have diverged  in these times were observing a major disconnect between
overnight rates and financial conditions that is reflected in huge spreads but also in a lack of
transactions and in nonprice rationing in markets
so coming back to the question of what some of our goals are  to address the problems that
we see communication is really the essential element and we should be aiming for maximum
impact in whatever actions we take and also in our communications  i think therefore that we
should bring rates down now as far as we think we can take them  but the more important decision
is articulating what we are going to do going forward why we are doing it how long we are
planning to do it and under what conditions we would stop doing it  some of the confusion that is
out there about what the federal reserve has been doing reflects the fact that our operations really
cover two very different kinds of things  on one side we are expanding liquidity and supporting the
recovery of financial markets by the cpff the mbs purchases and the upcoming talf  in other
facilities we are preventing catastrophic market outcomes through asset disposition such as the
bear stearns transaction aig and the recent transaction weve had with citi  in addition there are
a lot of technicalities and legalities to these facilities that make it hard for the general public to
understand what we are doing  so more fundamentally we need to communicate what we want to
accomplish and that importantly involves our commitment to price stability as many have said here
in the sense of keeping prices in the medium term rising in line with our 1 to 2 percent preference
and our commitment to a resumption of sustainable economic activity
when i turn to look at what kind of facilities we should be thinking about going forward
once interest rates are down to their minimum level there are really a few things that i would
highlight  first in many ways we could influence expectations about shortterm policy rates
through our longterm debt purchases as many have said  in particular when we try to lean against
expectations expressed in the yield curve that rates are going to rise soon and were seeing some of
that today we can intervene in markets that directly affect major elements of aggregate demand and
i would see that as a very important role of our agency mbs program and also the cpff to address
where firms are really being starved of working capital  because of its structure the talf
provides a very broad umbrella under which we could do intervention again where we see credit
markets failing and economic activity impeded by the lack of finance of a wide variety  i think that
we should look at the cpff and the talf more as backstop facilities that provide the credit we
need but also build in a kind of exit strategy so that when spreads come down there is an
opportunity for the market basically to tell us you can wind this down now
we need to communicate the criteria by which we are choosing these markets  we have
mentioned these three big market segments  i think simpler is much better than having something
thats very complicated or having many many facilities  as part of this the crucial thing is to
provide to the marketplace some kind of conditional commitment  if we dont feel that were ready
yet for the inflation target certainly between this meeting and the next we really need to think about
what kind of conditional commitment we could makewhat conditions in the marketplace would
lead us to feel that our work was largely done
i would also note though that the historical notes made the excellent point that the risk is
that we withdraw stimulus too quicklythat we believe the patient is healing when in fact the
patient is merely stabilized  so our commitment must be both ambitious in its level and compelling
as it is communicated to the public  i think we need to return to the expository approach that the
fed and thengovernor bernanke took during 2002 and 2003 by which we carefully laid out the
elements the foundation and the expected outcomes of our approach in that period  as valuable as
it was in 200203 it is even more valuable today when confusion and anxiety are shaping behaviors
that will amplify the downward forces in the economy  i also endorse the recommendation that
many have made to think about a press conference  the need for reassuring communication to the
public is i think very great
i would add two more thoughts  of course it is really crucial that we are coordinating our
policy with treasury and there are many ways in which we do that todaycertainly we need
coordination of fiscal and monetary policy  i frankly would like to see more of our assetdisposition
activities taken on by the us government so that it would be easier for us to describe the facilities
that we have as supporting the market and restoring market functioning  i also believe as im sure
that many of you do that we will probably need some kind of agreement with the treasury visvis
our exit strategy  i particularly underline the real possibility which several have mentioned here
that we may want to raise interest rates well before the markets are really fully healed or fully
sustainable by themselves  well need to be able to negotiate that in the sense of both the path we
take and the understanding we have with the fiscal authorities
then just to conclude here i also very much want to endorse the point that president
rosengren made about needing to fix the banking system and doing it sooner rather than later
there really is no ability for the economy to function without a strong banking system  certainly i
believe that you are hearing as i am of many instances in which the rationing that is going on
through the banking system right now is reaching a destructive potential  in that kind of world i
think we need to turn our attention to that  the federal reserve is one of the most important
supervisors in our country and in the world and i think we can do a lot to lead to the very tough
actions that need to be taken there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  several people have mentioned press
conferences  i should say that were looking very carefully at the idea of doing quarterly press
conferences with the release of the projections along the lines of the bank of england  if we decide
to do thatand input from the committee is welcomethe first one would be in february  it
would coincide in this case with the humphreyhawkins additional presentation  i have a speech at
the london school of economics in midjanuary in which i will be able to lay out a lot of these
issues  i dont know if thats soon enough but i dont know whether we think we should do more
communication or not  thats something we can talk about tomorrow perhaps but i did want you
to know that we are looking at the quarterly press conference model  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman my colleague harvey rosenblum made an interesting point
the other day that were at risk of being perceived as migrating from the patron saints of milton
friedman and john taylor to a new patron saintrube goldberg  laughter  by the way im
going to give a speech on rube goldberg next thursdayi do think that it is important not to make
it needlessly complicated  so i think its very important that we have this discussion  i welcome
the discussion and welcome the papers so that we can not only have a cognitive road map for
ourselves but also figure out how were going to clearly articulate a deliberate change in regimes to
the public  i want to underscore what you said at the beginning of this conversation mr chairman
we should be guided by whats best for the countryperiodand not get into internecine concerns
about governance  its whats best for our economy and whats best for the world economy
id like to talk about three points  i want to talk about the current predicament in very
general terms  i want to touch on governance and then on communications  first with regard to
our current situation its pretty clear that purchases and sales of fed funds have been distorted by
risk aversion distrust of counterparties and fear of pending bank insolvencies  quantitative easing
resulting in massive excess reserves weve talked about that complications arising from the
transition to paying interest on required and excess reservesas you pointed out earlier this is a
regime shift that were still trying to effect and perfect the need for gses to invest overnight
money at any positive rate bank capital shortages that prevent the gse funds from being
arbitraged and quite possibly the fdics temporary liquidity guarantee although that seems to be a
minor factorin these circumstances focusing on the fed funds target seems to me to be a
diversion of our focus and energy and i sent around a memo to that effect  moreover the short
term riskless rate the tbill rate is virtually zero  reductions in the targeted fed funds rate cannot
lower the riskless rate any further
adding to our difficulties is the fact that we simply do not know how financial
intermediaries or money and capital markets will behave and function when interest rates get this
low  we do have the japanese example  we are not japan  i have worked and lived in japan and
we have learned from what theyve done  but the fact is that we have no sustained experience in
the modern era in the united states with tbill rates and the effective fed funds rate trading near
zero  we do know that money market funds will become unprofitable if rates get much lower  let
me just say to those who sort of dismiss that i think we might look a little foolish if we drove some
of them out of business especially after creating two special facilities to support their continued
intermediation functions on the basis that they were critically needed for their roles in the
commercial paper market
furthermore ive spoken with several community bankers and i subjected governor duke
to some of that during her visit to dallas  their unanimous response to a further reduction in the
targeted fed funds rate would be to set a floor for their prime rate at its current 4 percent level or
some of them are suggesting that they would switch to a lending rate based off liboragain with
a floor to protect their margins which are being severely tested  to the extent that larger banks
depend on deposits as a source of funding reductions in the fed funds target rate from current levels
could damage their profitability also and this goes to one of the points made by president
rosengren and first vice president cumming  we do have to bear in mind that its important to
have a vibrant and healthy banking system across the country
in this new and untested interest rate environment it is in my opinion tenuous to assume
that the fed funds target rate is the marginal cost of funds to a bank and that all of the usual and
customary costs in pricing relationships will hold  if deposit rates approach zero as they are likely
to do for all but the zombie banks its probable that the demand for currency will increase a
prospect that i would prefer to avoid  to sum up were in an interest rate environment in which the
linear properties of our model are likely breaking down  so where does this leave us
it leaves us with the critical need to refocus our strategy and communication efforts on what
we have been doing and will continue to donamely restore the publics confidence and trust in
financial intermediaries and financial markets reduce term liquidity and credit spreads to something
approaching morenormal levels improve the flow of credit through financial intermediaries and
financial markets and restore economic growth and reverse the spillover of inflationary pressures
from asset markets to the markets for goods and services  operationally it seems to me that we need
to shift our focus away from the fed funds rate targetparenthetically which we cannot controlto
something that we might better influencenamely the reduction or perhaps a better phrase the
normalization of liquidity and credit spreads  the fact is that we have already entered this domain
and by stating it that waythat is approaching the normalization of liquidity and credit spreads
we would have a clear exit strategy and we could discontinue this focus when spreads return to
something approaching normal
this has the additional advantage that it is a conditional commitment  i would avoid any
reference to specific targeting for the monetary base or the size of our balance sheet  we simply do
not know in current circumstances how fast or how far as i referenced earlier in my question to
president lacker we need to expand our balance sheet to restore normal spreads or normal credit
flows  some of our facilitiesfor example the mmiffhave worked with almost no usage
others have acquired extensive usage  in sum it seems clear to me that focus on the target fed
funds rate is misplaced in the current environment  if we are to restore the functioning of the credit
markets we need to address that objective explicitly
with regard to governance in addition to reading the 21 papers that were sent out and the
bluebook this last week i read a novel called world without end written by ken follett  it should
have been called a book without end because it goes on for 1000 pages  laughter  its about the
plague in the fourteenth century  one of the interesting lessons from reading that book is that the
monks in that period who dominated society reverted to the old orthodoxy learned from the
greeks  they were the best educated  they were the oxfordeducated intelligentsia  but by
reverting to the old orthodoxy they did not learn what the nuns learned which is what you learn
from practice  the reason i mention this mr chairman is that i think there is great value as we try
to figure out and articulate the new regime to have these shared discussions at the table  i want to
thank you in that sense for your comments not only about good faith but also about the need to
have this discussed broadly within the fomc and not just adhere to the old orthodoxy  all of us
have different levels of experience and backgrounds and we learn from those different levels of
experience and backgrounds
finally on the issue of communications one of my colleagues often says that if youre
elton john you are expected to sing bennie and the jets every single time and at every single
concert  it seems to me that once we get and hone our message we must repeat it incessantly and
stay on message in order to have it penetrate  in austin you gave what i consider to be a hallmark
andnot trying to flatter youfor monetary policy a historic speech  what was bloombergs first
reaction  the fed may cut rates further  the message was lost  we all need to stay on message
but i think its very important whether we have press conferences or whether you give speeches
that we need to hammer the theme of the new regime that we are about to embrace over and over
and over again  so i didnt pick bennie and the jets just because of your name mr chairman
laughter  but i do hope you remember that we must have that constant refrain  if were going to
sell something we have to sell it by repeating it not asking the press to interpret it for us but to get
the message out inexcuse me governor kohnfull frontal view  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  im in awe of a presentation that has rube goldberg the
black death bennie and the jets and full frontal view all in it  laughter  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  im a visual thinker  laughter  so ill begin
where governor fisher ended his remarks  to thank brian david and nathan for two reasons
first obviously i thought you did a great job and second i didnt want to be the first jerk around
this table not to acknowledge you  so i felt some burden now to be 15 for 15 and thank you for the
work
let me make three background points and then try to answer some of the questions that
brian asked of us  first i think we have two risks in the zero lower bound discussion  one is
overstating the importance of our judgments today in helping the economy get back to potential
the second risk is understating the importance of prospective fed actions given our frustration that
our policy accommodation to this point has only partially offset the deterioration and credit
weakness in the real economy  the first trick is getting that balance right recognizing that our
actions are important but probably not determinative at least solely determinative of the outcomes
given what markets will end up doing with the messages we send and given the need for fiscal and
other policies  the second trick is that notwithstanding our announcements or what we take to be
our target the effective rate is likely to be very close to zero for quite some time  so maybe more
precisely in this context the zero lower bound problem could be understood to mean that the
expected protracted period of weakness will come because monetary policy is unable to provide
enough stimulus to generate a robust recovery  that is true as far as it goes but we shouldnt assign
more import to this problem than it deserves  that is the protracted period of weakness is not
simply or largely about monetary stimulus  its about a broken financial architecture of which the
official sector response including monetary policy is only one piece  at the same time monetary
policy cant be as efficacious as desired and is constrained by these zero lower bound problems
thus we dont have a free pass to stand idle  incremental interest rate policy may be of limited
value but its still relevant in stimulating demand
second pointthe judgments today are made harder by the degree of market discontinuity
and market dysfunction  i take very seriously the risk that reducing the fed funds rate to zero could
further degrade the functioning of financial markets and do so at a very inauspicious moment
getting that market functioning is our way out of this mess and though we would in normal
markets expect money market mutual funds and regulated and unregulated financial institutions to
adjust theres a lot about their behavior in the past six months that hasnt followed normal custom
i worry at this time when were trying to get markets to respond about putting an incremental
burden on their reaction function  the current period is distinguished from 2003 and other
antecedents by the broader systemic fears about our system of credit intermediation and i agree
strongly with the idea advanced in the materials that were presented last week that the level of the
treasury repo rate is more critical to treasury market functioning and the functioning of other
markets than the target rate or the effective fed funds rate  the deterioration in repo market
liquidity that bill and others spoke about correlates strongly with lots of other bad thingsfails in
treasury markets the inability to predict market clearing prices and the inability to hedge other
assets  during this period in which we have seen this unfortunate behavior everything else seems
to have gone wrong as well so it is hard to draw any causation here  but i do worry about those
market effects
as a third point on balance im inclined to believe that the macroeconomic benefits of
pushing the envelope to get to zero may be outweighed particularly now by additional financial
market problems  in more normal circumstances disruptions in these markets could be addressed
quickly by changes in market practices  but there is reason to worry this time how quickly they
could come
let me turn now to some of the questions that brian raised  first on the question of
whether we should move or keep our powder dry i think its clear that once we decide and we
know where we want to go we should move as swiftly as possible to get there  but i think the key
word there is readiness  so when we want to make this final move we need to be ready in three
respects  first the board and the fomc have to be ready in terms of what our consensus is
second the markets must really understand why we are making this change in regimethey need
to comprehend fully what is driving our policies  third we have to have an operational ability to
perform and execute and thats really a question for bill and his colleagues as we continue to
expand our facilities
the second question was about the cost of reducing the fed funds rate target to zero  i
would put it simply that the zero lower bound in my opinion isnt zero but it is lower than 1
percent  im not sure if its 25 or 50 but i would be probably cautious about pushing beyond the
point of our comfort
third in terms of the benefits of communications we are judged by our actions far more
than our words and i think the markets have gathered a view of what our reaction function is  so
when we talk about the need for our communication language to emphasize the conditionality of it
i think thats quite consistent with how weve talked previously about our forecast  our judgments
on policy are dictated by our forecasts  as our forecasts change so too might our decisions  so i
think id put our communications in that regard
in terms of introducing or reintroducing an inflation target at this point im not sure that it
would at least in the short and medium term drive the kind of market reaction that we would
expect  i think markets would be wondering after long discussions over the previous eighteen
months about subcommittees and communication policies and inflation targets  why now  is it
that were actually now more concerned about inflation expectations and the mediumterm view of
whats consistent with price stability than we were during much of that period in which we were
talking about inflation that was higher than our expected range  im not sure i have been able to
internalize and conclude why that would be appropriate at this very moment to introduce into our
statements
in terms of nonstandard policy tools and the purchase of large amounts of agencies and
treasuries i think that the chairmans point about the composition of the asset side of our balance
sheet is key  in a different regime i would have been uncomfortable about agencies  but my view
is that they are wards of the state at this time  the us government has said so  to the extent that
we can provide our fire power to both the treasury market and the agency market it is probably
worthwhile to do both  we probably have an opportunity to test the importance of some of these
nonstandard policy tools in executing the timing and process and making public our announcement
to this point of providing up to 600 billion in aid to this market  i would prefer to avoid setting a
ceiling on conventional ratesthats not the role of the fed  better to leave that announcement to
others  i think it is also critically important with respect to agencies that we make sure we
understand the posture and policies of the new administration  if they think that the agencies are
effectively going to be treated like wards of the state id feel more comfortable
in terms of the expansion of credit backstop facilities my first concern would be that id
defer to bill and his colleagues about operational bandwidth  second i think we probably have an
opportunityand you do mr chairman in your speech early next yearin announcing what our
criteria are and what our framework is for expanding our credit backstop facilities  third id say
that we do need to address probably in that same period our exit strategy and clean up any edge
problems that might have developed during this period  the cmbs market is in lousy shape  i
think thats not largely because of what weve done but there is a gravitational pull on the bit of
liquidity that is out there to the residential market and away from the cmbs market  theres
probably an opportunity for us to try to clarify that in the context of the talf program
finally in terms of other nonstandard tools that would be particularly useful again i think it
would be important to state publicly in all of our discussions the need for the fiscal authorities to be
taking first losses and ensuring that the new administration the new treasury is prepared to
support the fed in that so that theyre in the creditloss business and we are really just using our
facilities and knowledge to put that into place  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  i thank you very much  i will make it 16 out of 16 on the excellent
work of the staff but i think also something that comes through from that is that we have to have a
great deal of humility given the situation that were in  we can use analogies from japan  we can
use analogies from other parts of history or from sweden but there are a lot of parts that are unique
and a lot of what were doing is as i think president bullard said outside where some of the data
have been in the past  so we do have to come at this with a little humility  actually the japanese
experience weighs very heavily on me because thats perhaps one that i know well and in which i
see perhaps the closest analogies  one of the facts that president bullard mentioned is extremely
important and weighs heavily on methey have had their target rate at less than 1 percent for
almost a decade and a half  but something that president bullard didnt focus on is how little
growth they have had in that period  we are moving into an era of very low interest rates and we
want to revive growth and think about how we can do that and that gets to the overall objective  i
think we also want to avoid the problems that japan has had because it would probably not be a
good idea to be in a regime in which we feel forced to have the fed funds rate at less than 1 percent
for a decade and a half
clearly there are theoretical empirical and practical reasons for moving rapidly  the
japanese example is very clear on that  practically we are largely already there  also i simply
cant imagine that over the next 6 or even 12 weeks were going to get data that would make us
think that we shouldnt be moving interest rates down or that we arent in a state of the economy in
which we have to do something fairly aggressively  we already see some disruptions in the markets
because of the low effective rates  we have to be mindful of these consequences and monitor them
closely
as has been mentioned a couple of times we have the comparison of the markets in which
weve intervened that seem to be working a bit better and the markets in which we didnt intervene
that arent working as well  although i actually do agree with that interpretation we have to be a
bit careful about that in going forward because there could be some unintended consequences such
as in commercial paper  a1p1 interventions can help that market out but they could have some
unintended consequences for a2p2  just because the other markets are not improving as these are
we have to be careful about drawing conclusions that it must mean that we need to intervene in
market y and market z and a b c down the line  thats not to say that i think that what weve
done so far has not been helpful  i do believe that it has been but i think we just have to be very
very careful about those unintended consequences
communication strategy as so many people have said is crucial because were stepping
into a new world  we basically have a lot of explaining to do and one of the key things to explain
is that we have not gotten to the end of our tether that theres still a lot more that we can do even
though a lot of the world thinks that once we have given up on interest rates or gotten down to
our lower bound we cant be that effective  we have to be very effective in arguing that no thats
not the case  in the discussion a number of people mentioned that trying to provide a framework
for understanding this is really really crucial  explaining that we may need to keep interest rates at
a low level for a while based on the conditions in the economy is important but that doesnt mean
that low interest rates are not helping economic recovery  we should be expressing concerns that
inflation could fall below the level that we consider consistent with our dual mandate  i think thats
something that is also very important to talk aboutmethods that we could use to attack that
i think this does in the broad sense raise the value of an inflation target  but i would be very
concerned as i think president stern and some others mentioned at this point about getting into that
debate because even if we did go to the congress and a few members of the congress said thats
okay that still would be a very big debate and i think a distraction from exactly where we want to
go  but we need to think about that over the long run particularly if we start to see the inflation rate
going down or if we see that were not being effective at fighting expectations of deflation  but i
think for the moment that it would be too much of a burden on our communications and would
perhaps cause too much confusion in the market  they have gotten all of these new facilities
were stepping into a new world potentially depending on our decision tomorrow  if we also then
introduce an inflation target at this time it may just be a lot to digest  but i think it is a discussion
that we need to continue to have
in terms of the specifics of the actions that we need to take moving forward once again i
think the lessons of japan are important  we want to focus a little more on the asset side than on the
liability side  the chairman characterized things in a very effective way to argue that were not
doing precisely the same thing and that we potentially can be more effective  i think its not just
about some particular reserves level  the example that president rosengren gave is one that weighs
on me  we need to be nimble in responding to different problems  we may have new facilities
we may purchase more or fewer securities  being constrained by or picking out a particular
number for reserves doesnt seem to be the most effective way to build our credibility that we will
fight these problems  although there is a long history in the fed of looking at things like the
monetary base nonborrowed reserves and such i think there are good reasons that we moved away
from them  of course im from the university of chicago and so milton friedman is spinning
right now laughter but money demand has not proved to be a very stable function over time
particularly now  the money multiplier has certainly been anything but stable making it more
difficult for us to focus credibly on a particular reserves level to see what the ramifications are for
the rest of the economy  that is not to say that we shouldnt have an eye on those issues  but given
the uncertainties i would be reluctant to focus on that  i think a focus on the asset side is much
more effective
ultimately in all the programs and actions that we undertake we have to think about the exit
strategy as a number of people have mentioned  i think thats very important for us both with
longerrun expectations and in just making sure that as we do intervene we minimize the amount
of distortion  in some sense we are purposefully distorting what the market is doing now but in
some sense we think of the market as being distorted from where it normally would operate  so we
have to be at peace with that  we need to do that  but we also want to make sure that as much as
possible we try to restore that functioning  making clear that we do these things with reluctance and
do want to get out of them to restore the normal market functioning will again be a very important
part of our communication strategy to make this all work  thanks
chairman bernanke  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  id like to make it unanimous in thanking the staff
for me particularly you have extended the process by which every hour that ive been here has
been deeply educational and have helped put the things ive been doing since i got here in some sort
of a context  along those lines the one thing i thought i might address is the economics of the
world from whence i cameand that is the economics that bank managers are facing today
because i think thats an important part of this discussion  im sure most of you have heard from
bankers really pleading not to lower the rates and theres a very good reason for that  i actually
expanded the number of banks that i normally talk toin addition to federal advisory committee
the north carolina bankers and some of the texas bankersand the plea was unanimous  please
dont lower the rates  the reason for that really goes to the prime rate not the fed funds rate  if the
prime rate moves down i do believe that dollar for dollar its going to reduce bank profitability  if
we were to go to zero if prime were to go to 3 percent i think it would take our entire banking
system on an operating basis to an unprofitable level
to give you an idea the noninterest operating costs of banks have not changed an awful lot
over the last seven or eight years  they fluctuate about 5 basis points but its a little over 3 percent
of assets in noninterest operating costs  the noninterest income that offsets that may be 60 basis
points  so you are looking at a 240 basis point hurdle that margins have to get over  the interest
yields right now are 40 basis points lower than they were in 2002 going into the 1 percent fed funds
rate  credit costs are certainly higher  theyre higher by 10 to 18 basis points  fee income is lower
by 10 to 16 basis points  if you put all of that together profitability is already lower by 60 to 75
basis points  on a marginal basis deposit competition is fierce  cd rates are in the 3 to 4
percent range  money market accounts are around 3 percent  new entrants into the insured deposit
arena are intensifying this competition still further and the banks are incredibly bitter about
nonbanks coming into that arena  lowercost funding is available from some nondeposit sources
but the banks are feeling pressure from their examiners to limit usage of noncore funds including
discount window borrowings  a bank issued the fdicguaranteed debt last week three years at a
cost of 2 percent plus the 100 basis points that they pay the fdic  so that cost is 3 percent  all of
these costs are in excess of the prime rate
on the asset side the banks are shying away from purchases of securities because of mark
tomarket concerns  the new loans that are being booked are being tied to prime but theyre tied to
prime with floors with those floors generally in the 5 to 5 percent range  some existing loans
have floors although many do not  home equity loans credit card loans and smaller bank
commercial loans are typically tied to prime  prime might reference that banks own primeand
some banks did not lower their prime or were slower to lower their prime the last time we changed
the fed funds targetbut more commonly it will reference new york or wall street prime  larger
loans and mortgages are more likely to be tied to libor although i understand that competition in
recent years has moved toward contracts that give the borrower the option at any time of using a
primebased rate or a liborbased rate
with pressure on both sides of the interest margin credit costs are sure to rise and with the
prospects for fee income down the banks are uniformly begging for no change  when asked how
they might manage with lower rates most said that the only choice they would have at this point
would be to shrink their balance sheets rather than compete for business at a negative spread
the other rates that affect bank profitability have not moved with the fed funds rate and so
in this case it is about spreads not rates  now its certainly possible that individual banks are
exaggerating the effects that lower rates will have on their institutions and that their reactions will
not be as strong as they claim  however my question is what if they are right  if we get down to
a 25 basis point regime and we find out that it simply puts our banking system out of business how
do we then reverse that and move back up and how do we explain that change
im not as familiar with the economics of money market funds but i have to assume that
their pressures are similar and the note indicates that they might be willing to operate at a loss for a
time  but the more we communicate that this would be an extended amount of time how long
would they be willing to operate at a loss  no matter where we set our fed funds target theres
really very little that we can do differently as in starting tomorrow  the current actual rate reflects
a broken market  there are much lower volumes in the fed funds market right now and a much
higher percentage of those are with institutions that cant earn interest on reserves
so bill i still see some hope for the fed funds market coming back  over time as banks
get more comfortable with each other the opportunities to get a little higher yield as well as to open
up an unsecured borrowing source will lead banks back into the fed funds market  but if that
market did start to revive a bit i would hate for us to be in a regime in which at that point we had
to pressure it again to bring the rates back down  for this reason i think suspending the fed funds
target as a  policy tool rather than lowering it might be the safer course because it would let prime
find its own level and the banks might not necessarily feel pushed to lower prime if we did not
change our target
i had a number of notes on communication most of which have been said  but the one
point id like to make is that when i think of communication i think of it on a retail level  i think
about our communication to consumers and to business owners rather than to the more sophisticated
audiences that the notes tend to refer to  i think we have to be sure that we do communicate on a
retail levelthat we communicate on the nightly news local newspaper level  many of you have
backgrounds in education and i think at this point its our job to teach and explain what were doing
and how it might affect individual consumers and individual businesses  in that sense its
important that we stay on message and that we have very clear terminology that we use over and
over again  even in the conversation today the term quantitative easing was used differently by
different speakers
i do think we have to be careful again on the fed funds rate target  i noticed the same thing
that president fisher did as far as the chairmans december 1 speech  any time we talk about the
fed funds rate it is the only thing thats going to be reported  finally i also think we have to be
careful about references to the experience in japan  we should emphasize the differences and the
reasons that we expect to be successful because in many places references to the experience in
japan lead people to believe that were in for a very very dismal future and i dont think thats
what we want to communicate  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you all  i actually would like to try to
distill some impressions from our discussion and going even a step further maybe draw some very
tentative conclusions for the statement and decision tomorrow  i do that in the spirit of fairness
because tomorrow you have a chance to rebut what i say now  so let me just draw some tentative
conclusions and if you disagree or if there are multiple options perhaps you can respond in our go
rounds tomorrow
first with respect to the level of the fed funds rate i think generally speaking people want
to be aggressive  they recognize the difficulty the severity of the situation  some were somewhat
fatalistic saying well we cant really keep the rate much above zero anyway so its somewhat of a
moot question  with that said governor duke was just the last of a number of people who did
point out that there are various institutional market and other considerations that would suggest
trying to keep the rate above zero if possible although she had a very interesting alternative which
is just not to have a target which might be helpful in at least a few contexts  let me ask bill about
feasibility here  suppose for the sake of argument that we had a range of 25 to 50 and we set the
interest rate on reserves at 50  would that be feasible  could that work
mr dudley  it might work eventually but right now i would guess the spread between
the effective funds rate and the target would be bigger than that  were sort of running that
experiment right now  the market consensus is that the fed is going to reduce the target 50 basis
points at this meeting  thats incorporated in the current federal funds rate trading because its the
lowest interest on excess reserves during the twoweek maintenance period  were trading in a
range of about 10 to 15 basis points  we dont have that much information but right now that
spread is probably 35 to 40 basis points  so i think we probably couldnt do what you said  if we
worked on ityou know took the gses and made it so that they couldnt sell fed funds and did a
few other thingsmaybe we could get that spread down to 25 basis points over time  brian do you
have anything
mr madigan  i agree
chairman bernanke  all right  well thats relevant information  so it may be that
our options are a range of 0 to 25 or no target but those are two options that i would point to  i
should also say as i discuss the statement here i think that in a very real sense this is a transitional
meeting  i mean we cant go from 0 to 60 in one meeting and i think we have to allow for the
possibility that there will be further refinement as we go forward into january  so i raise as the first
point exactly how we state the policy decision  do we make reference to the funds rate  are we
okay with a 0 to 25 range  i hear and recognize the concerns about too low a rate and its just a
question of feasibility in the short term  one advantage about having a range is that we could
indicate that over time were trying to get to 25  that would be at least slightly helpful i think
the second issue i want to mention is communication  i thought there was actually a good
bit of consensus  a number of people spoke somewhat approvingly of an inflation target or some
broader inflation objective but i didnt hear much sentiment for doing it immediately or in the very
near term  i think it is something that we ought to take very seriously particularly if inflation starts
to drop further  we should do it in a prepared way and i need to consult and so on  but i agree
with the comment that this is a longterm objective that we have  this may be an excellent
opportunity to do it because not only is there no tradeoff between growth and inflation in this
context but also there wont be any suspicion that were choosing a rate thats convenient  i mean
we are probably below the rate that we would choose as a target  so it might be worth considering
in the longer term
for tomorrow though i did hear quite a bit of interest in conditionality in terms of the zirp
zero interest rate policy type of strategy  we hadi think it was in alternative a paragraph 3a
statement that said the committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant
a federal funds rate near zero for some time  i wonder if that meets what people were talking
about or were there people who wanted to express it more explicitly in terms of our qualitative
objectives or otherwise  i hear a willingness to have at least a qualitative conditionality for our
policy  i would invite overnight or tomorrow any alternative phrasing that people think might be
more effective  it is an important decision to make
the third issueand im just making very high level comments here i have a whole bunch
of notes that im not going to repeat at this pointhas to do with our various programs and
purchases  i think that the great majority of the committee is comfortable with mbs and treasury
purchases  at least thats what i heard  i took a majority to be in favor of or at least accepting the
credit facilities that we have  there were requests for more metrics more explanation more
criteria more exit strategies and so on and i think those were all valid points  what i take from
this is that these assetside programs the credit facilities as well as the mbs and other programs are
part of our new regime that most people view them as part of our new regime and that the
inclusion in our statement of some reference to these kinds of programs as in the variants that were
circulated in the bluebook would probably be desirable
a point of considerable discussion and some contention with respect to both governance
and communication was the use of a measure of the base or excess reserves as a quantitative
indicator of monetary policy  with those who advocated it i think there were really two objectives
if i may  one was to have a measure of monetary policy that would influence expectations and if
effective would raise inflation expectations and the like  but another function of that i believe
was the desire to have from a governance perspective the fomc setting some kind of indicator of
monetary policy  with respect to the use of say the base as a measure of monetary policy i would
say that for tomorrow were pretty far from being able to feel comfortable doing that  we havent
done the work  we havent done the analysis of the transmission mechanisms  we havent looked
at what monitoring ranges and how they might work  so it would be a radical step to take in one
meeting  i leave that open as we continue to think about what the right indicators of policy are
i understand the desire for governance  i think what i would proposeand again by all
means respond tomorrowwould be at least in our directive that we have as somewhat suggested
already the committee affirm or otherwise indicate its approval of quantitative programs
500 billion mbs 100 billion gse debt 200 billion for talf if you are willing et ceteraand
pursuant to that that the board make a regular practice of bringing any new program or any
expansion of existing programs to the fomc for review and discussion  that may not be entirely
satisfactory but it would certainly indicate to the public that the fomc has reviewed it from a
monetary policy perspective and it would appear in the directive the minutes and so on  i put that
out as just a possible compromise on that issue
i think those are the main elements of the statement and the directive  i heard a lot about a
desire for an explanatory document talking points other supporting material speeches and press
conferences  we hear that and it will be very important for us to try to develop such materials  i
said at the beginning that i think its unusually important for us to try to speak in a unified way
externally not because i want to avoid dissentand of course everyones views can be
expressedbut as governor duke pointed out because i think we have an educational mission here
that needs to be taken seriously  so the more consistent we can be in our explanations and our
discussion the better it will be
those are just some things that i drew from the discussion  again youll have an
opportunity tomorrow at least one goround or maybe two gorounds to agree or disagree  any
comments  final thoughts
all right  the first question is what time do we begin tomorrow  we are scheduled for
900 am  i think that would be adequate  does everyone feel comfortable keeping their economic
goround remarks reasonably short  thats the tradeoff  if everyone is game for that well start
tomorrow morning at 900 and now adjourn the board meetingyou didnt notice thatand also
just remind you that theres a reception and dinner available for your convenience  there will be no
business conducted at that dinner  thank you  see you in the morning
meeting recessed
december 15 2008morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  lets start off today with the
economic outlook  dan will you be taking the lead
mr covitz3  thank you  i will be using the packet of charts that starts with the staff presentation on financial markets  the charts for the other two presentations are included in this packet and follow mine  as shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit longterm nominal treasury yields posted their largest intermeeting decline in over twenty years  the primary explanation for this decline outlined to the right is that investors markedly revised down their economic outlook leading both to a lower expected path of monetary policy and to continued flight to highquality assets and away from securities with credit and liquidity risk  yields also fell following fed communications regarding alternative monetary policy tools such as the purchase of longterm treasury securities agency debt and mortgagebacked securities
one measure of flight to quality shown in the middle left panel is the covariance of percent changes in stock prices and treasury yields  when investors pull back from risktaking stock prices fall and so do treasury yields resulting in a positive covariance between the two  when flighttoquality effects are substantial prices in both markets are volatile making the covariance particularly large  in recent months the covariance soared to well beyond its 2002 peak  since the october fomc it has come down somewhat but remains extremely elevated an indication of continued and substantial flight to quality  another perspective on investor perceptions is provided by the equity risk premium shown by the red shaded region in the panel to the right and measured as the difference between a trend yearahead earningstoprice ratio on sp 500 stocks and a real longrun treasury yield  this measure ballooned in mid november as stock prices and treasury yields fell and then narrowed a bit over the past month as indicated by the plus signs  even so the risk premium remains extraordinarily wide
yield spreads on 10year corporate bonds shown in the bottom left panel increased further over the intermeeting period  the spread on highyield bonds the red line topped 1600 basis points and the spread on bbbrated bonds the black line exceeded 600 basis points  the bbb spread is now comparable to average levels recorded on similarly rated bonds during the great depression  changes in corporate bond spreads can be decomposed into changes in oneyear forward spreads as shown in the panel to the right the 117 basis point intermeeting increase in the 10 year bbb spread reflects increases in forward spreads across the term structure consistent with investor flight to quality and away from risk  in addition the forward spreads ending in two years and five years increased more than the spread ending in 10 years suggesting that investors have become more concerned about credit risk in

3  the materials used by mr covitz ms aaronson and mr ahmed are attached to this transcript appendix 3
the medium termthat is more concerned about the possibility of a protracted economic downturn
your next exhibit examines recent conditions in the commercial paper market
as shown in the top left panel outstanding financial cp and abcp the black and red lines dropped in september and october but since then have partially rebounded  in contrast nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding the blue line has been relatively flat although nonfinancial programs rated a2p2 not shown have contracted roughly 40 percent since early september  the noticeable increases in financial cp and abcp around the time of the last fomc meeting reflect the implementation of the federal reserves commercial paper funding facility cpff which ramped up quickly and now holds roughly 300 billion of highly rated commercial paper  the recent stability is also likely due to flows back into prime money market funds since early november shown by the red bars above the zero line in the panel to the right  according to recent surveys of moneyfund managers prime funds have substantially increased their holdings of abcp reportedly reflecting the confidence provided by the assetbacked commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility amlf which stands ready to provide banking organizations with nonrecourse loans to fund purchases of highly rated abcp from 2a7 money funds
turning to pricing the middle left panel shows that the spread on overnight a2p2rated nonfinancial cp the blue line trended down over the intermeeting period  about half of the reduction in a2p2 spreads reflects a sample shift toward higher quality overnight issuers while the other half of the spread reduction is due to improvements in pricing for a constant sample of issuers suggesting a positive spillover from sectors of the market directly affected by the fed liquidity programs the overnight abcp spread the red line also declined on net over the intermeeting period  in contrast overnight yields on cp from highly rated nonfinancial and financial programs not shown have traded at levels close to the effective federal funds rate for the past several weeks
to examine yearend pressures the panel to the right shows the gap between thirtyday and overnight a2p2 yields  this gap has been volatile but has trended up since late november when the 30day rate from our smoothed yield curve began to reflect trades that crossed yearend  yearend funding pressures are explored further in the bottom left panel  the red bars show average percentages of paper that were placed over yearend as of middecember from 2003 to 2007  the corresponding percentages for 2008 are denoted in blue  the first two bars indicate that with respect to getting past yearend programs rated above a2p2 as a group are ahead of their average pace over the previous five years  in contrast the second two bars show that lowerrated programs are behind  overall as outlined in the bullet points to the right conditions in the commercial paper market appear to have been stabilized by the various policy interventions in this market  even conditions in the nonfinancial a2p2 sector which falls outside the government liquidity and guarantee programs
have improved but the sector remains strained  yearend pressures appear substantial for lowerrated programs
the remainder of my briefing reviews funding flows in longerterm markets starting with financing for nonfinancial businesses  as shown by the red portions of the bars in the top left panel of exhibit 3 investmentgrade bond issuance has held up fairly well in recent months while speculativegrade issuance shown by the blue portions of the bars has dwindled to nothing  this pace of financing does not appear to pose substantial nearterm funding pressures for the nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole  as shown by the blue bars to the right the volume of speculativegrade bonds due to mature is relatively light in 2009 and 2010 before it moves up somewhat in 2011  moreover the pace of investmentgrade bonds that will mature in coming years denoted by the red bars is comparable to recent issuance levels  in addition as shown in the middle left panel liquid asset ratios for firms rated speculative and investmentgrade remain relatively high
perhaps more troubling for nonfinancial businesses is that funding from banks has slowed  as shown in the middle right panel ci loans expanded rapidly in september and october reportedly reflecting to a substantial extent a wave of drawdowns on existing lines of credit  however the expansion of ci loans halted in november  equally striking the plot in the bottom left panel shows that the change in commercial mortgage debt based on flow of funds data turned substantially negative in the third quarter as the outstanding amounts both at banks and in securitizations fell  overall nonfinancial business borrowing shown on the bottom right has slowed sharply this year and with financial conditions expected to remain tight and investment projected to be weak the staff forecast calls for borrowing to remain very tepid through at least 2010
household credit is the subject of my final exhibit  mortgage debt shown by the blue line in the top left panel is estimated to have contracted in the second and third quarters in combination with the continued decline in house prices shown by the thin black line  we have very little data for mortgage debt in the fourth quarter but mbs issuance in october shown to the right was somewhat below the already low third quarter level  other types of household debt have also begun to contract  as shown in the middle left panel revolving and nonrevolving consumer credit rose only a bit  in the third quarter and then fell in october  while the slowdown in consumer credit likely reflects in part a reduction in demand the secondary market for such credit has also become substantially impaired  as shown to the right issuance of abs backed by auto and credit card loans slowed markedly in the third quarter and was near zero in october and november as quoted spreads on bbb and aaa abs not shown soared  results from the michigan survey shown in the bottom left panel suggest that the contraction in household debt reflects both the reduced supply of credit and weak demand  as shown by the black line an unprecedented share of households has pointed in recent months to tighter credit as the reason that it has not been a good time to purchase an automobile  at the same time the percentage citing concerns about the economy plotted in red has increased to the top of its historical
range and remains the reason mentioned most often by respondents as a deterrent to purchasing an automobile  with financial markets under stress consumer credit likely will need to be funded mainly on bank balance sheets in coming quarters
however as shown in the panel to the right banks unused loan commitments for both households and businesses have declined substantially this year as net new commitments have not kept up with drawdowns on existing linesanother indication of the tighter supply of bank credit  stephanie will now continue with our presentation
ms aaronson  i will be referring to the exhibits that follow the green nonfinancial cover page  the indicators that we have received since the last fomc meeting suggest that real activity has been contracting rapidly and as dan has described financial conditions have continued to deteriorate  starting with the labor market private payroll employment the inset box in the top panel plunged 540000 in november and the figures for september and october were revised down noticeably  all told novembers drop brought the threemonth decline in private employment the black line in the top panel to an annual rate of 42 percenta much steeper pace of job loss than we were expecting in the previous greenbook  the retrenchment in november was pervasive across both goods and serviceproducing industries  as shown in the middle left panel initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued their steep climb since the november survey week consistent with a further large drop in employment in december
meanwhile in the household sector nominal sales at the retail control grouping of stores the inset box in the middle right panel declined 15 percent in november which given a large energydriven price decline translates into an increase in real spending for the month  we had been expecting real outlays in this category to fall further  as shown by the rightmost blue bar with the latest retail sales number we now think that real pce on goods other than motor vehicles is on track to fall at an annual rate of 5 percent not as bad as the 9 percent decline we projected in the greenbook but still very weak  nearterm indicators of consumer spending point to further weakness in the coming months  notably the reutersuniversity of michigan survey index of consumer sentiment plotted in the bottom left panel remained at recessionary low levels in the first part of december  sales of light vehicles the bottom right panel which slumped in october fell further in november to an annual rate of 101 million units a much slower pace than we had anticipated  anecdotal reports suggest that sales are soft again this month  given the weak fundamentals for demand and tight credit we project vehicle sales to remain depressed over the next several months
as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2 residential construction has continued to slide  single family starts fell further to 441000 unitssomewhat lower than our expectationsand permits continued to move down last month  in the business sector new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft the red line in the top right panel dropped for a third straight month in october and with orders falling below shipments for a second consecutive month the backlog of unfilled orders
shrank further  yesterday the board released data on industrial production in november  total ip the inset box in the middle panel fell 06 percent in november excluding the effects of rebounds from the boeing strike and september hurricanes ip moved down 16 percent last month  the black line in the panel plots the three month diffusion index of manufacturing ip a measure reflecting the net fraction of industries that experienced an increase in production  as you can see over the past few months that number has plummeted to 21 indicating that the contraction in industrial activity has been remarkably widespread  overall the incoming data led us to steepen significantly the contraction in real gdp that we are forecasting for the current quarter and the first quarter of next year  in these two quarters we expect output to decline at an average annual rate of nearly 5 percent  in both quarters a significant chunk of the revisions has come in private domestic final purchases lines 3 and 4 of the table  in addition the available indicators suggest that firms are acting aggressively to limit unwanted increases in their inventories  as shown in line 5 firms have been drawing down inventories at a moderate pace in the second half and we expect even faster liquidation next quarter in response to the sizable contraction under way in final sales
your next exhibit focuses on the mediumterm outlook starting with some of the key background factors that have influenced our thinking about the outlook since the october greenbook  on the downside as noted earlier financial conditions have deteriorated further in recent weeks  as can be seen in the top left panel the index of financial stress that we track continued to rise sharply  one important component of that increase in stress has been the further widening of corporate bond spreads for investmentgrade issues shown by the gray shaded area in the top right panel  in addition equity prices are lower than we projected taking an even bigger bite out of household resources  meanwhile in the external sector the path of the dollar shown in the middle right panel is somewhat stronger than in our october forecast and the outlook for foreign economic activity has weakened further  shaghil ahmed will have more to say about these developments shortly
as you know from reading part 1 of the greenbook in light of the intensification of recessionary forces that emerged over the intermeeting period we based this forecast on the assumption of a lower level of the federal funds rate than in our previous projection not shown  in addition we now assume that 500 billion in new fiscal stimulus actions will be enacted early next year on top of the roughly
165 billion in the stimulus package enacted earlier this year  these assumed fiscal actions include permanent tax cuts for most individuals higher transfer payments grants to state and local governments and support for housing  as shown in the bottom left panel these new federal programs boost the impetus to gdp growth from fiscal policy considerably relative to our assumptions in the october greenbook
two other factors also provide more support to real activity in this forecast  first mortgage rates the bottom right panel have fallen about  percentage point since the october greenbook  with the spread over the 10year treasury yield still quite wide we project that mortgage rates will fall further over the projection period  second oil prices not shown have fallen more in recent weeks than we anticipated in the
october greenbook the lagged effects of these declines provide a greater lift to spending in 2009
the top left panel of your next exhibit summarizes our mediumterm projection
on balance we expect that the factors restraining activity will far outweigh the supportive influences with real gdp falling at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first half of next year  the decline is led by a steep drop in business fixed investment lines 5 and 6  in the second half of the year real activity begins a slow recovery as pce line 3 picks up and residential investment line 4 begins to stabilize  in 2010 the recovery is projected to gain momentum as household spending strengthens further and business purchases of equipment and software begin to rise  as is typical the recovery in nonresidential investment is expected to lag
by postwar standards we are projecting a deep prolonged recession and a very sluggish recovery  the middle left panel provides some perspective  the black line shows the level of real gdp indexed to its own peak in the second quarter of 2008 by way of comparison the red and blue lines show the paths of real gdp during the recessions that started in november 1973 and july 1981 respectively  as can be seen the projected contraction in real gdp in the current episode is about in line with that experienced during those two earlier big recessions but our projected recovery is noticeably more prolonged  the box to the right summarizes some of the important factors that impede the projected recovery  first we think that the economy will continue to face significant albeit moderating financial headwinds over the next two years with elevated risk premiums restrictive lending conditions and general uncertainty restraining real activity for some time to come  second tight monetary policy did not help generate the current recession and we dont see monetary ease as likely to generate as much impetus to recovery  in fact as the third bullet point notes the federal funds rate is already close to the zero lower bound greatly limiting the scope for conventional monetary policy to provide further stimulus to real activity
the importance of this last factor is illustrated by the bottom set of panels  the exercise is similar to the simulations presented in the bluebook except that this one allows the federal funds rate to turn negative  the green line in the bottom left panel shows the simulated federal funds rate path  if unconstrained the optimal funds rate would fall below zero in early 2009 and drop to negative 5 percent in the third quarter of 2010  in this scenario the unemployment rate shown in the middle panel peaks at 7 percent in 2009about  percentage point lower and a year earlier than in the greenbook projection  the fourquarter change in core pce prices shown at the right bottoms out at just over 1 percent in mid2010 and then turns up in contrast with the continued deceleration in the extended staff forecast  in the context of the zero bound achieving an outcome for real activity and inflation consistent with the unconstrained optimal control exercise would likely require some combination of greater fiscal stimulus and nontraditional monetary actions than we have built into the current projection
your final exhibit summarizes the outlook for inflation  as shown in line 1 of the top left panel we now project that total pce price inflation will slow to about
1 percent in 2010 while the core rate line 7 falls to 08 percent  the decline in inflation reflects a combination of widening slack in resource utilization reduced energy and materials prices and a net decline in core import prices these factors also push down longrun inflation expectations  i should note that we received data on the november cpi this morning  the total cpi fell 17 percent driven by a sharp drop in energy prices  the core cpi was unchanged last month  we had been expecting an increase of 01 percent  one measure of resource utilization the unemployment rate is projected to reach 8 percent in 2010  in our forecast the wide unemployment rate gap puts substantial downward pressure on costs and prices  however as suggested in the middle left panel we may be overstating the downward pressure on inflation caused by slack  in particular the current cycle has been associated with especially large employment declines in several industries notably construction and finance  if these declines are leading to an unusual amount of employment reallocation across industries structural unemployment would increase which in turn would raise the nairu
the remaining panels present some analysis of the issue using a measure of sectoral reallocation and a set of beveridge curves  the middle right panel depicts an index of sectoral employment reallocation across industries  the index is based on the growth rates of employment in 15 industries relative to the growth rate of total employment adjusted at the industry level for typical cyclical movements in employment shares and is similar in spirit to a measure constructed at the chicago fed  as can be seen even after removing the typical cyclical behavior increases in sectoral reallocation often occur around recessions which is not surprising since each business cycle produces a unique set of imbalances  indeed the amount of sectoral reallocation indicated by this measure has been rising over the past year or so
however to date it remains low relative to previous spikes in reallocation  another way to determine whether there has been a rise in structural unemployment is through the socalled beveridge curve two versions of which are shown in the bottom panels the version at the bottom left plots the unemployment rate adjusted for the emergency unemployment compensation program on the horizontal axis against the job openings rate measured by the job openings and labor turnover survey jolts on the vertical axis  the bottom right panel shows a beveridge curve calculated using the helpwanted index as the measure of job openings  if there has been a significant increase in structural unemployment then one would expect that for a given level of the job openings rate the unemployment rate would be unusually highthat is to the right of the plotted beveridge curve  this might occur for example if many of the job openings were for nurses but a disproportionate number of the unemployed were bond traders who are not qualified for the job openings laughter
so what do these beveridge curves say about structural unemployment  the blue and red circles in the two panels show the data points for the third quarter of 2008 and for the most recent months available  the latest readings from the jolts
do stand to the right of the estimated curve while the latest readings from the help wanted index are closely in line with past experience  at this point we are reluctant to draw strong conclusions from just a couple of observations from either measure and we read the evidence as consistent with at most a small increase in structural unemployment thus far  of course these data do not tell us what will happen in the coming quarters when we anticipate further job losses in financial services and continued weakness in construction and manufacturing  shaghil will continue our presentation
mr ahmed  i will be referring to the exhibits that follow the blue international outlook cover page  financial markets in foreign economies remain stressed but have not suffered further pronounced deterioration since the october fomc meeting as shown at the top of your first exhibit government bond yields in major industrial economies have dropped likely reflecting further expected monetary policy easing lower inflation expectations and a firming of the belief that economic recoveries are not around the corner  equity markets shown in the middle left have changed only moderately on net since your last meeting compared with large declines in previous months  the emergingmarket aggregate cds spread shown in the middle has been volatile but remains elevated  as shown to the right gross private capital inflows to emerging markets through debt and syndicated loans have continued to trend downward
the exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign currencies the black line in the bottom left panel has moved down a little since the last fomc meeting some bilateral exchange rate movements were substantial however with the dollar appreciating markedly against the pound and depreciating against the yen  as shown to the right the dollar has appreciated somewhat against the currencies of our other important trading partners driven by movements in the mexican peso and the brazilian real  earlier this month the dollar registered one of its biggest daily increases against the chinese renminbi in recent years although this shows up only as a tiny blip in the chart  we believe that chinese authorities will allow the renminbi to depreciate somewhat in the coming months ndf nondeliverable forward contracts also imply an expected depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the next year or so
incoming evidence on economic activity abroad continues to be grim  as shown in line 1 of the table in exhibit 2 we now estimate that foreign economic growth was below 1 percent in the third quarter  although growth in canada line 7 and mexico line 12 surprised on the upside readings elsewhere were generally weaker than expected with real gdp contracting in the united kingdom the euro area and japan lines 4 through 6  as shown by the red bars in the middle left panel net exports made significant negative contributions to growth in these three economies
domestic demand the blue bars was also soft  growth in emerging asia line 9 was barely positive in the third quarter reflecting subdued growth in china line 10 and substantial contractions in most of the newly industrialized economies shown in the middle right
with data from the current quarter pointing to greater weakness than we expected and a substantially more pessimistic us outlook we have further slashed our forecast for total foreign growth to minus 1 percent in the current quarter and minus 1 percent in the next before a recovery to a positive but still relatively weak average pace of about 1 percent through the remainder of next year  the widespread nature of the economic slowdown in large part seems to reflect trade linkages  as depicted at the bottom in recent years us economic growth the black line and the growth of total real exports of our major trading partners the green line have been significantly related  although foreign exports are affected by many factors in addition to us gdp the relationship shown and the gloomy outlook for us economic activity through next year paint a bleak nearterm picture for foreign exports
your next exhibit focuses on the advanced foreign economies in more detail data from europe point to a sharp slowing in the current quarter  the timeliest indicators are pmis purchasing managers indexes which as shown in the top left panel have plummeted in recent months in both the united kingdom and the euro area reaching levels well below those observed during the 2001 downturn  as depicted to the right in japan exports the black line and industrial production the blue line have contracted during the current quarter and conditions in the labor market have deteriorated further as manifested by the decline in the ratio of job openings to applicants the red line  indicators from the current quarter in canada shown in the middle left point to weakness in real exports and a continued drop in housing starts  authorities in advanced foreign economies are attempting to shore up aggregate demand through fiscal stimulus  as listed in the middle right panel many countries have announced stimulus packages including germany france and the united kingdom  we estimate that the actual stimulative content of the packages announced so far is likely to be small but expect that additional measures will be introduced next year  the total fiscal stimulus that we are assuming should boost growth in the advanced foreign economies by  to  percentage point at an annual rate from mid2009 through 2010  the possibility of bigger fiscal initiatives is an upside risk to our outlook for foreign growth
many of the foreign central banks have become more aggressive in easing monetary policy as can be seen at the bottom left  since the last fomc meeting the bank of england and the ecb have slashed policy rates by a total of 250 basis points and 125 basis points respectively and the bank of canada and the bank of japan have lowered rates by smaller amounts  more rate cuts are expected in all of these economies which could bring rates in japan back down to the zero lower bound  as shown on the bottom right inflation in the advanced foreign economies is now expected to recede at a faster rate than previously projected reflecting sharp declines in commodity prices as well as diminished resource utilization
turning to emergingmarket economies as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 4 the recent behavior of chinese industrial production total exports and
imports from asia is now reminiscent of developments during the year 2001  the plunge in imports from asia casts doubt on the notion that china has become an independent engine of growth in the region  as depicted to the right korean exports and aggregate industrial production in korea singapore and taiwan are plummeting in mexico thirdquarter output was bolstered by expansion in the agricultural sector but as shown in the middle left exports have moved down sharply and consumer confidence has dropped below 200102 levels  in brazil too shown on the right there has been some softening in exports the black line which had been supported by high commodity prices although industrial production the blue line has held up a bit better
with prospects for exports in the doldrums policy stimulus has become all the more important to the outlook for emergingmarket economies  as noted in the bottom left monetary easing has continued with interest rate cuts in many emerging asian economies including china and korea  china malaysia and brazil have also lowered bank reserve requirements  in addition fiscal stimulus packages have been announced in a number of economies most notably china  chinas 16 percent of gdp spending package considerably overstates the ultimate effects on growth as it includes some previously announced projects its implementation may take longer than announced and the federal government is slated to pay for only 30 percent
discounting the headline number we estimate that the chinese package could boost growth 1 to 1 percentage points per year  other countries such as korea and mexico have introduced smaller but still sizable packages which we expect will give some impetus to growth
in sum our nearterm forecast calls for total foreign growth to be the weakest since 1982 and as sketched out in our alternative simulation in the greenbook there would appear to be downside risks even to this forecast
your final exhibit focuses on the us trade outlook  weak global demand has contributed to falling prices for food and metals which have led a sharp decline in nonfuel commodity prices the blue line in the top left panel  oil prices the black line also have continued to move down rapidly but futures prices project some recovery ahead  the fall in commodity prices has exerted downward pressure on
us trade prices shown in the top middle panel both core import prices and core export prices dropped markedly in october and november which for import prices were the largest monthly declines in the fourteenyear history of the index  a sense of the extent of weakness in global demand can also be seen in shipping rates shown to the right which have taken a nosedive
as in the 2001 recession us real exports and imports of goods shown in the middle left are now trending down  imports the red line have been moving down all year  the falloff in exports the black line is a more recent development and in part reflects hurricanerelated disruptions and the strike at boeing  as shown in the table growth of both real exports of goods and services line 1 and real imports line 3 was noticeably weaker in the third quarter than we had previously estimated
for the current quarter we see both real exports and real imports contracting sharply reflecting the slowdown in global demand  looking ahead our projections for a stronger broad real dollar shown in the middle right along with our weaker outlook for foreign growth have led us to revise down sharply our forecasts for exports especially in 2009  in the near term our projections for imports have also been marked down considerably  as shown in line 5 the contribution of net exports to
us growth is expected to swing slightly negative in the current quarter following large positive contributions earlier this year  the current quarters contribution is considerably weaker than projected in both the october and the december greenbooks as last weeks export data surprised us on the downside  next quarter with a substantially greater stepdown in imports than in exports we expect the contribution of net exports to us growth to jump back up before returning to negative territory for the remainder of the forecast period  that concludes our presentation
chairman bernanke  thank you  remind me what your anticipation of the
current account deficit is for next year
mr ahmed  i think the deficit goes down to about 3 percent
mr sheets  yes  we see the current account deficit as shaghil said bouncing
between 3 and 3 percent of gdp through 2009 and 2010  in the near term you have much
weaker foreign growth and a stronger dollar but that is offset by the lower level of oil prices so
that keeps the current account deficit around the 3 to 3 percent range
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  questions for our colleagues  president
bullard
mr bullard  i was just looking at the policy rates abroad herethis is the picture in
exhibit 3 i guess  it shows the ecb the bank of canada and the bank of england all leveling
out before they get to zero  do you have a sense of what the plans are there or what they are
saying about that or are we going to see a sort of global move to zero  what is your sense of
that
mr ahmed  looking at the policy that is going forward first of all we are forecasting
here what we think they will do not necessarily what we think they should do  given their past
behavior we think that they will be ratcheting up the rates the first chance they get  the timing
is a bit different but the rates are broadly in line with market participants expectations  in the
case of the euro area for example at the end we are even a little lower than the market
participants are expecting
mr bullard  so this is from surveys of market participants
mr ahmed  no  this is our projection
mr bullard  right  but you are getting the information from surveys and other
things
mr ahmed  it is informed by surveys yes
mr sheets  i would add that i think the ecb in particular has a real aversion to
policy activism  in fact trichet was on the wires this morning indicating that they are not really
comfortable with where they are right now  they may pause in january and i think it really
would take a more severe outcome for activity in the euro area than what we have incorporated
in our forecast to get the ecb down to zero  nevertheless that is a risk  i would say that there
are downside risks here  i would put a higher probability on seeing the bank of england or the
bank of canada go to zero  but as shaghil emphasized here we are basically just writing down
what we think they are going to do and we generally follow the futures markets fairly closely
but it certainly would be a surprise to me if over the next six months we saw other major
central banks in the proximity of zero
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  just a comment on the projections for chinathese numbers seem to be
less than what they are saying officially  am i correct
mr ahmed  yes  these numbers are less
mr fisher  that sort of jibes with the reports that i am hearing back from the ceos
doing business in china  in fact the cutback has been much more dramatic than they expected
semiconductor firms for example have put shipstop orders meaning they are stopping for lack
of payment and the retailers are seeing a noticeable drop in attendance at their stores  but i
think that our numbers are more fitting
mr ahmed  i think the latest official numbers dont incorporate the november data
which just came outactually they came out yesterdayand some trade data since the
greenbook
mr fisher  but you are saying that we do expect further currency depreciation
mr ahmed  in the near term yes through the first half of next year
mr fisher  i have three questions mr chairman  one on the commercial paper
market  what is the spread between a1p1 and a2p2 right now
mr dudley  for term it is a huge spread probably 300 basis points or so but
overnight it is much smaller
mr covitz  as you go out the term it is even more
mr fisher  so the incentive for a1p1 borrowers is to do everything they can to keep
that status obviously  it is a much more attractive proposition
mr dudley  yes
mr fisher  which leads to moreconservative financial management and business
management  you do everything you can not to become an a2p2 borrower to slip off the
a1p1 ladder
mr dudley  historically bbb was the sweet spot of the corporate capital structure
and that was associated with a2p2 commercial paper borrowing which people thought was
safe  it turned out not to be quite as attractive as they had thought
mr covitz  i think over history this isnt the only time when a2p2s have come under
stress  whenever there were disruptions in the marketfor example after the california utilities
defaulted in the early part of the decadea2p2 outstandings plummeted and a2p2 spreads
rose though not nearly to this magnitude  this is truly extraordinary  but that is a portion of the
market that is under stress because this market in general tends to be very very skittish  at the
first sign of trouble there is quantity rationing  i didnt show the outstandings of the a2p2s but
they have gone downas i think i mentioned40 percent in the last couple of months  so
quantity rationing is already taking place and they are having trouble getting over yearend
mr fisher  i guess my point is that the way in which it works is that it gives people
incentives to be even more conservative in the financial management of their operations  on
household credit do we have a sense of how much shift is taking place between credit card usage
and debit card usage  under these conditions of duress has that been a noticeable change or is
it just marginal
mr covitz  i dont know those data
mr fisher  it might be something to look at next time  finally on the inflation table
in exhibit 5and you have talked about the numbers that were released this morningdo you
see additional monthly deflationary numbers on the headline cpi or could you see this
happening for a prolonged period say for a quarter  we have a table here for 2008 2009 and
2010  on the top line the pce price index do we envision monthly or perhaps quarterly
extensions of deflationary headline numbers
mr stockton  no  we have another two months of small declines anticipated as
the energy prices continue to pass through and then beyond that some small increases  so we
dont see this as an extended period of negative headline
mr fisher  so decemberjanuary
mr stockton  decemberjanuaryexactly
mr fisher  and what is the order of magnitude
mr stockton  we are looking for about minus 05 percent in december and minus
01 in january  we are also not expecting the core figures to remain as low as they have been
running for the past month or two  we do think that they have been held down by some very
significant declines in air fares  that could continue for another month or twoagain as the
energy price passthrough works  they have also been held down by some very large declines in
lodging away from home which is a volatile series and it is not likely to sustain this level
despite the fact that we dont see them as low as they have been the past two monthsthat is
declining to flatwe are expecting some fairly small increases going forward  we have core
inflation heading down and all of these exhibits have shown a significant reduction in price
pressures coming from import prices from energy prices and from broader commodity prices as
well as the increase in slack that as stephanie pointed out is keeping a real lid on labor costs
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  our staff does such a fine job  maybe my
hearing is going but i missed the names of our staff presenters  can we get them introduced to
us
ms aaronson  im stephanie aaronson
mr covitz  im dan covitz
mr ahmed  shaghil ahmed
mr lacker  great  thank you very much  i have a question for stephanie  you
know they do such a great job
chairman bernanke  jeff are you feeling okay  laughter
mr stockton  we apologize for our lack of manners  laughter
mr lacker  maybe it is a southern thing i dont know  laughter  the sectoral
reallocation is really intriguing and it is something that i have been curious about in this whole
episode  the measure is not one i am familiar with  it is one for which you count each industry
as a unit right
ms aaronson  exactly  it is a lilien type of dispersion index  this isnt actually
how we calculate it but it is essentially how the industrys share of employment changes relative
to total employment  so it is the growth in that industrys employment relative to total
employment  what we do is that we know that over the business cycle each industry has a
typical patterndurables employment goes down a lot during recessions whereas say health
care doesnt go down that much  those types of changes arent typically associated with sectoral
reallocation  that is we dont really think of those things that are typical over the cycle as being
associated with an increase in the nairu  we want to take those out so we take out the typical
cyclical movements such as manufacturing always goes down in a recession and finance is
acyclical
mr lacker  and housing always goes down in a recession
mr aaronson  housing and construction always go down so we take that out and
then we say okay so now there are these atypical movements that are greater than we usually
see  that is what we would consider the sectoral reallocation  that is what is left over  you can
see as i mentioned in the briefing that actually during recessions there is a lot of sectoral
reallocation even once you take out the usual declines in employment that differ across
industries  that is because each recession has different causes  different industries have grown
a lot during the boomlike finance recently or say communications during the late 1990sand
those sectors are going to shrink more than usual during the recessions and get back to more of
an equilibrium state  that is what is going on here
mr lacker  yes  so it is sort of a bummer that these go up in the recession if you
are trying to measure what is happening to the nairu  but i always thought of the phrase
sectoral reallocation as having to do with the theories of the business cycle in which cyclical
downturns are caused by an unexpected decline in a given industry that causes resources to shift
out of that industry and that it takes time for them to be absorbed into some other industry  from
that point of viewif you are trying to measure that component as opposed to policyinduced
widespread declines in activityi would think you would want not to take out the cyclical part
i am thinking about housing  we devoted a lot of resources to housing in 2005 much less now
those resources thrown on the market in fact are the proximal cause of the initial downturn in
employment growth  a lot of ancillary industries are related so i would think that if we didnt
take out the usual housing cyclical thing which is really sharp in the early periods you would
see a bigger rise here
ms aaronson  i have looked at that and actually it doesnt make that much of a
difference  construction goes down in every recession and so by that measure sectoral
reallocation is higher in every recession  i mean construction is contributing more to sectoral
reallocation here than in previous recessions because the declines have been larger  so that fact
is captured  the fact that construction is having a largerthantypical decline is precisely what is
captured here  but even if you said okay well maybe in every recession industries shrink and
that is associated with some sectoral reallocation the measure actually looks very similarnot
just across the current episode but across all the episodes
mr lacker  yes yes  i guess it is also related to how you think about the nairu
to some extent if unemployment goes up in recessions then what unemployment is supposed to
be goes up in recessions as well it seems  i have a question about the first exhibit  it is the first
set of exhibits  it is also about commercial paper  would you folks encourage us to view the
improvement that has taken place in the a2p2 market as a measure of how the a1p1 market
might have improved had we not intervened  it is sort of a baseline right  it is like the control
group
mr covitz  i think it is very difficult to interpret it that way because the intervention
did happen and the bulk of the improvements happened subsequent to the intervention
mr lacker  what sort of spillovers from our intervention in a1p1 do we expect
perhaps to have influenced or to have led to an improvement in a2p2
mr covitz  i think that the decline in the a2p2 overnight suggests improvement  but
there is some concern about sample selection and you have to worry about that at the same time  it
could be just that you are getting higherquality issuers in the a2p2 sector  but it turns out youre
not  it turns out that it explains only about half of that decline
mr dudley  you know it also may have helped the money market fund industry to
keep its money knowing that there was a facility outstanding that could provide liquidity for that
sector because we did see inflows back into the money market mutual funds
mr lacker  so their willingness to buy a2p2 may have been affected by another
program not the cp one  you are saying the money market fund program
mr dudley  they provided more stability to the system as a whole
mr rosengren  to the prime money funds
mr lacker  so we cant separate the individual programs
mr rosengren  there is a second factor  there has been discussion of extending the
a1p1 program to a2p2 which the industry is certainly aware of but i would highlight with the
a2p2 that a lot of the mutual funds do not want to hold it over the end of the year  most of the
a2p2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over yearend  there is a real risk that that market will
have to rely on backup lines of credit and its not clear whether the a2p2 market comes back after
the new year if that happens or in what capacity it does  so i think the real test will be to look at
this chart in january or february
mr lacker  well you wouldnt expect speculation about imminent extension of the
program to a2p2 to support the overnight rate for a2p2 unless they expect it to be implemented
overnight  a question about strains  to what extent are we able to disentangle whether the market
is strained or the issuers are strained
mr covitz  in the cp market itself
mr dudley  you can look at credit ratings for example or whats happening to their
profitability  it is highly likely that the strains in the cp market are more dramatic than any change
in the underlying financial condition of the a2p2 borrowers
mr covitz  you could think about what the default risk is say for the corporate sector
you could break down a pretty simple model of defaults conditional upon our outlook for the
economy and that would have the default rate rising
mr lacker  but you dont observe investors expected defaults themselves
mr covitz  you dont but you can take a guess at what you think that is and it is
higher  it is not at great depression levels under any of the models ive looked at  its not even at
the levels of default rates in 2002
mr lacker  so you are saying that this paper is underpriced  is that how you measure
strains  i am always curious as to what strains mean
mr covitz  the way that im referring to it is just that risk premiums are really really
large  im not saying that they are necessarily irrational  i am just saying that they are really really
large
mr lacker  thanks  great job
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i have a question or observation which is of the
optimistic variety although it presents sort of a challenge  in the mediumterm outlook in exhibit 4
if you focus on 2010 the greenbook projection has real gdp growing at 24 percent  were
beginning to come out of this  the unemployment rate is peaking  if you could implement the
optimal control federal funds rate it would be bottoming out  maybe that would mean whatever
quantitative easing credit programs we would be doing would be at their peak and maybe would be
coming off  but it is also the time that the inflation rate is low and continuing to fall  this is going
to be a tension for us as we start thinking about and we are about to engage in mentioning the
possibility that inflation could bewell whateverlower than ideal  what would you guess the
risks might be around that inflation forecast  how hard is it going to be for us not to continue to
worry about inflation being low or to communicate that inflation is going to continue to be low even
though things are improving  just any kind of advice would be helpful
mr stockton  my guess is that if our baseline forecast evolves in the way we are
expecting here you are still going to be worried about the downside risk to inflation even if in fact
we were in the process of bottoming out because there will still be a very substantial output gap  on
the commodity price side things are fairly stable and at least in our forecast inflation expectations
are probably drifting down some  on the other hand there are upside risks to that inflation forecast
as well  i do actually think that our baseline forecast on the assumptions that we have had to make
in constructing it is reasonably well balanced because another possibility is in contrast to the
gradual downtrend that were expecting in inflation expectations that inflation expectations will be
stickier you will be able to convey a greater sense that you wouldnt want inflation over the longer
haul moving down below 1 percent we wont get as much disinflation into inflation expectations or
into labor costs and youll get greater stability there than were expecting  so to my mind looking
ahead monitoring how those inflation expectations evolve in the context of an economy where
things are weakening will be very important
mr evans  thanks
chairman bernanke  president bullard
mr bullard  on the same topicthe mediumterm outlook and in particular the
optimal control exercise at the bottom which is showing us how were constrainedis there some
quantitative policy that we could undertake that would get us to the green lines here maybe by
creating more inflation than we would think desirable in the long run
mr stockton  the point of constructing this optimal control is to say that gee if you
werent constrained here is how we thought optimal behaviorthe sort of optimal outcome
would be given the shocks  youre asking me whether or not there are quantitative policies that
you could put in place  i was actually hoping that you folks were going to be able to tell me
laughter  you face a challenge in constructing policy but we have collectively a challenge in
understanding how whatever policies you implement are actually going to show through into our
longerterm outlook  the point here is that in the absence of some nonconventional monetary
policy actions or substantial fiscal stimulus we see a very extended period of weak activity high
output gap and declining inflation
mr bullard  sometimes what people do is they say okay suppose you could just
control inflation directly which we know is hard but suppose then you just trace out an optimal
path for inflation that would get you to the green line
mr stockton  obviously if you could levitate inflation expectations that would be
one thing  the other thing is that note 21 in the package we sent you included some exercises that
suggested if you took actions that could significantly reduce the longterm treasury rate and
compress mortgage spreads there would be ways in which youd be able to provide more stimulus
for the economy  now all those things we suggested at least the ones that we showed in that note
werent sufficient to get you back to equilibrium quickly  but there are policies obviously that we
think will be able to provide some stimulus
mr bullard  this optimal control exercise then would have an objective that would be
a quadratic objective in some real output or unemployment
ms aaronson  minimizing the unemployment rate and the deviations of inflation from
its target
mr bullard  thats saying that you wouldnt be willing to suspend your inflation
target for a while to improve things on the real side  i think that might be helpful as well because
then the committee could think about what those tradeoffs are  in ordinary times you might have a
certain weight on the two objectives but you might shift that in other situations
ms aaronson  if i can also just put this in a little more contextby the end of 2010
the gap on the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control is about
1 percentage point  so if you use a simple rule of thumb from an okuns law type of model that
would be a couple of percentage points on the level of gdp  gdp would have to grow a couple of
percentage points faster over 2009 and 2010 to close that 1 percentage point gap in the
unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  question for nathan  in an earlier meeting if i recall correctly there
was mention of the european banks exposure to emergingmarket sovereign debta concern about
the trend lines in that sovereign debt  are you tracking that in any sense  my concern is that there
could be another fullblown debt crisis of some kind coming  it is not covered in these charts but
do you have a sense of default risk on the part of emergingmarket sovereigns
mr sheets  the european banks are particularly exposed much more so than us
banks or japanese banks  a big chunk of that exposure is to central and eastern europe and as you
suggest we see significant risks to the european banks as a result of that exposure  what makes it
even a little dicier is that exposure is concentrated in several countries particularly sweden austria
and to a slightly lesser extent italy  recently there has been significant economic turmoil in
hungary and ukraine  the fund has stepped in and the eu has helped as well with large financing
packages  the latest one were watching very closely is the situation in latvia where the exchange
rate is significantly overvalued  the external position looks very very dicey  the fund is in there
negotiating a program  there has been a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the
exchange rate regime  the banking system also looks vulnerableso what should be done with the
banks  it is not exactly clear how all that is going to be resolved  my personal feeling is that given
the risksand the europeans recognize the extent of the risksif latvia goes it could blow out the
rest of the baltics and then sweep around into central and eastern europe and then feed back into
western europe  so i see the risks there as being of first order for the europeans
given that recognition i think that the eu and major european governments are going to do
whats necessary to make sure that the situation in latvia stabilizes at least for a while  the end
game over the next several years is very much an open issue for a lot of these economies that were
in ermii and evolving into hoping to adopt the euro  i think that there are potentially some very
pronounced vulnerabilities and some painful adjustment that will need to happen in some of those
central and eastern european countries  so absolutely that is a major risk  its one were watching
as closely as we can
mr fisher  nathan you would probably have been arrested for treason if you had said
that in latvialiterally  the economist who gives a negative forecast is arrested for treason  stay
here  laughter
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not lets start our goround with first
vice president cumming
ms cumming  thank you  i thought i would make a couple of points that underscore
the substantial increase in the downside risks that we incorporated into the forecast that you all
received on friday  that change was really encouraged by our economic advisory panel which
suggested that the downside risks were much larger than we were estimating at the end of
november
first we have been meeting as of course all of you do with small business people  bill
dudley put a panel of investors together too and i have a couple observations out of that and our
discussions with community bankers  one is that the cutbacks in financing are very real  there is a
lot of evidence that the banks are going in and looking at lines and cutting them back to both
investors and the smallbusiness community  the small business community is also on the
receiving end of much tighter financial management at their larger customersthat is the people
theyre supplyingas those firms are not paying their bills or are extending the terms on which they
pay their bills to a much greater number of days  that has induced a hunkeringdown mentality on
the part of the small business owners  the other sobering thing they pointed out to usand this is
very much in line with governor dukes comments about the community banks yesterday we hear
the same thingis that small businesses and the community banks can hold out for a while but not
forever margins are getting squeezed and financing is getting squeezed  the precautionary actions
that the small businesses are taking will help them for a while but they cant hold out for more than
six or nine months
that is a particularly sobering statement for us in the second district because despite the
fact that we are at the epicenter of the financial industry in new yorka major driver for the
second district economywe have only just barely started to feel the effects of layoffs and
reductions in activity in the city  our regional leading indicator index went down very very sharply
in the month of october but that is still to be realized in the economy  in particular when we have
looked at past episodes the declines in incomes that we have suffered in the region have ranged
between 4 percent and 10 percent in the financial industry when we actually get into one of these
adverse periods  that decline is usually spread over three or four years so we are really talking
about something that could last a good bit longer than six to nine months in our district
second we do a survey of inflation expectations that is in many ways similar to the
michigan survey and our survey results are almost completed and are very similar to those of the
michigan survey  but we do ask one question that isnt asked there and that is about the longer
runthat is the 201011 outlook for prices and inflation  from that we can impute a risk of
deflation which was 6 or 7 percent in early october and is now 12 percent  so that risk of deflation
seems to be growing even in the kind of population that is surveyed by the michigan folks  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  as requested i will be brief  like the
greenbook we see an economy in which the unemployment rate remains very elevated and
inflation is below my target for several years  our own equations would indicate that these elevated
unemployment rates are likely to put even more downward pressure on the inflation rate than
forecast in the greenbook  the labor market is extremely weak and there is a significant risk of
deflation  i believe that greater use of nontraditional policies will be needed to mitigate moresevere
outcomes than encompassed in the baseline forecast
on the financial side i would just highlight two points  first many banks are placing
interest rate floors on home equity loans and on commercial loans  pervasive use of floors may
make the choice of which low federal funds target to pick of little relevance to actual borrowing
costs  we may want to consider surveying banks to get a better understanding of where these floors
are currently being set  second many firms are reporting that their lines are not being renewed and
are asserting that it reflects problems with the bank not the borrower  discussions with community
banks indicate that for smaller borrowers community banks are benefiting from this trend
however it may be useful to understand better how the reductions in lines particularly at troubled
banks are affecting the overall economy
just a general point  i think bank micro behavior is going to be very important for
macroeconomic outcomes and we might want to increase the amount of effort that we are putting
into understanding both their financial condition and how their behaviors may be changing over the
next six to nine months  whether thats done through the bank supervision process or the loan
officer survey or which mechanism we use i think we need to probably get a little more intelligence
on exactly what those trends are  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the economic news since the last meeting has
certainly been grim and our presentation today bore that out  our directors and other district
contacts are quite gloomy and their reports are also consistent with a broadbased pullback in
discretionary outlays by consumers and firms
in these circumstances with the funds rate around 18 percent it is hard to see a benefit of
prolonging any further reduction  i agree with the staff analysis that any potential dislocation in
money market institutions is likely to be minor and i observe that to the extent that money market
institutions provide value to the economy in the form of circumvention of prohibitions on interest
and other legal restrictions on financial arrangements the traditional welfare analysis would count
their demise as a benefit rather than a cost  but i have to admit i havent tried explaining that to a
money market fund manager  laughter
the hard question now i think concerns the possibility of deflation  we have seen negative
overall inflation since energy prices peaked in julyit was 18 percent for the pce at an annual rate
since then and 4 percent before todays release for the cpiand the core indexes have softened
notably as well  i still think we are going to be able to avoid this fairly easily but i do not think the
risk is negligible  it is one of the most dangerous prospects we face right now and we have to pay
very close attention to it  the reason i think it is going to be easy to avoid is that we have seen
declines in core inflation before when energy prices fellmid2005 and late 2006 are recent
examples  further compensation growth does not yet appear to be slowing rapidly although those
data are fairly dated and so it is hard to sense what the last couple of months are going to look like
the key to avoiding deflation of course is our ability to shape expectations about the future course
of monetary policy  i had a spirited discussion about this last night over salad with governor kohn
and mr eggertsson  this is essentially what all the models tell youthat staying out of a
deflationary equilibrium requires commitment to paths for the monetary base that are inconsistent
with a steadily falling price level and that commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate low is
not sufficient
now it is sort of hard to get a handle on this  it took me a while but the key to thinking
about this is that models with taylortype rules embed within them the perfect credibility of
inflation returning in the long run or over a medium term to the targeted rate that is built into the
taylor reaction function  if instead you take those models and just allow arbitrary fiscal and
monetary policy rules that is when you are forced to face the result that committing to an infinite
series of zero nominal rates is not sufficient and that you have to keep a monetary aggregate from
declining along with the price level
one way to think about this is that it is just like preventing inflation  to prevent inflation
we have to prevent expectations that the value of money will fall in the future  to rule that out we
have to rule out expectations that the quantity of money is going to rise continually and we do that
with interest rates  this line of reasoning is different from the reasoning you get in a phillips curve
with purely backwardlooking expectations where you have a recursive relationship between real
growth and inflation  instead in any model with a little forwardlooking stuff you have
expectations driving things  preventing deflation is the same thingpreventing expectations that
the value of money will rise indefinitely  to do that you need to prevent expectations that the
quantity of money will fall indefinitely and you would like to do that with low interest rates but
you cannot at the zero bound  so you have to influence expectations about the future course of the
base  this to me is the simple intuition for that  all of this is just to suggest that our ability to
communicate is going to be crucial
mr kohn  including over salad  laughter
chairman bernanke  all of these strategies are timeinconsistent of course  so we
have to be willing as a committee to sit here and accept higherthannormal inflation ex post  i just
point that out  we have to ask ourselves if we would be willing and if the public would be willing
to accept that
mr lacker  timeinconsistent is another way to say that they require commitment
chairman bernanke  i understand  im just saying that there are also different ways
to do it  we could also just target a higher inflation rate which is probably another way of doing it
mr lacker  right  you could target the inflation rate not falling  i mean we dont
have to go all the way  this is the subtle thing about this  i think the pure taylor rule overstates our
credibility but people do not think that we are going to follow it perfectly  they dont have very
diffuse priors over what policies  we are somewhere inbetween and i think bolstering that
credibility is important  something i was going to say in the policy roundgiven that we havent
announced a target we ought to try that first  that comes first before saying that we are going to
move our target up for a little while
chairman bernanke  i would just commentand i think that your point is a good
oneas we go forward we are going to be thinking hard about how to influence expectations
absolutely  your point is also right as we discussed earlier about why we need additional policies
besides our zero rate policy either other kinds of quantitative policies that are obviously linked to
base movements or fiscal or other policies as well  so i dont think there is that much disagreement
on the analysis
mr lacker  no i do not think so  the point i was making about the base is that none
of those is sufficient to rule out deflation without specifying what the base is
chairman bernanke  okay  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the reports from my contacts have been very
weak for several weeks now  sadly i feel as though the data have been catching up with the
anecdotal comments that i have been receiving for a while  i have been hearing a lot of comments
along the lines of orders have fallen off a sheer cliff the lights were suddenly switched off and
my business is dead in the water  one thing i have noticed is that the negative outlook has spread
to more and more corners of the economy even those corners that had remained robust for a
relatively longer period  for example one of my directors who runs a manufacturing company and
exports 70 percent of his products is a producer of highly specialized equipment that is used in steel
production  he has few competitors and no debt and until recently he was feeling very comfortable
with a two and a half year backlog  last week he reported that the backlog has essentially vanished
his customers problems have now become his problems  this has become a typical refrain  we
had become used to hearing companies talk about their desire to hold onto liquidity  now
businesses are also focused on how they are going to protect themselves in this weakening
economy  even businesses with a healthy amount of cash are cutting back sharply on investment
hiring and production plans
in this environment it is clear that forecasts need to be revised down sharply  like the
greenbook my own projection which seemed pretty dire just a month ago has also been revised
down sharply with the incoming data and anecdotes  the question now is how long and how deep a
decline we will experience  at the same time it also remains difficult to judge how far disinflation
will go  my projection sees substantial output gaps and energy prices that are likely to remain low
that has caused me to lower my inflation projection further as well  my inflation forecast now is
clearly below desirable levels for much of 2009  still it looks as though the risks remain very much
to the downside for output and inflation if only because further downside misses are getting more
and more problematic  the insurance metaphor i think has been exhausted  we are now more in a
situation of treating mass trauma  perhaps some of our actions will later be judged as having gone
too far  but in my view right now it clearly is better to ensure that the treatment is large enough
rather than risk falling short  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  the third district economic news is similar to
the national news  its all bad  our december business outlook survey which remains confidential
until thursday will post another very weak number  in november the number was minus 393
the december reading will be released and it will be minus 329somewhat better but still deeply
in negative territory  new orders shipments and employment are all very weak  price indexes on
the survey have fallen appreciably below zero for the past two months and are near their lowest
levels since we began the survey in 1969  this is after being at nearly their highest levels over the
same interval just a few months ago  moreover firms are expecting prices to continue to decline
novembers reading marked the first time that the future pricespaid index has been negative  the
mood is generally quite grim  the greenbook also paints a very bleak picture  i would like to think
that this isnt the most likely outcome but it is increasingly difficult to argue against that based on
recent economic data  i have revised down my own forecast of course  although im still not quite
as pessimistic as the greenbook i admit that the greenbook is no longer an outlier as i am used to
thinking about it  the forecasts for output are nearly as bad as or are worse than the economy
experienced in 197475  inflation has moderated significantly and nearterm inflationary
expectations have also moderated  our december livingston survey participants see cpi inflation
averaging just  percent in 2009  in the greenbook forecasted core inflation will be just over
1 percent next year and will decelerate to  percent in 2010
with the growth prospects so weak and inflation expectations decelerating the appropriate
real funds rate obviously will probably decline raising the possibility as we discussed yesterday that
the zero bound on nominal rates will pose a problem for us  at the same time since midseptember
the effective funds rate has been trading well below the fomcs target of 1 percent  as we
discussed yesterday we are effectively conducting monetary policy through quantitative easingby
which i mean an expansion of the feds balance sheet by both conventional and nonconventional
means  i have no objections in principle to this easing process but as i discussed yesterday i
believe that we need to acknowledge publicly that we are now in a new regime with a new way of
implementing monetary policy and that it is a deliberate choice of this committee  otherwise we
risk confusing market participants or implying that we are no longer in control of monetary policy
but in doing so we need to communicate how this policy will be conducted going forward  the
board of governors and the fomc will have to decide how they will handle the governance issues
surrounding this new regime  it seems clear to me that monetary policy determinations should
remain in the purview of the fomc regardless of whether we are using standard or nonstandard
policy tools
thus i think we have to come to grips with three very important policy issues at this
juncture  they include 1 how to implement monetary policy via an expansion of our balance
sheets for standard fed funds targeting 2 what decisionmaking process the fomc and the board
should use in implementing these policies via the balance sheet expansion and 3 how to
communicate all of these to the public in a transparent and most important credible fashion  i
agree with the chairman that we need to maintain and embrace the collaborative process between
the board of governors and the fomc which has been our method of moving forward during this
crisis  but i remain convinced that in these times of uncertainty we need to be explicit and to
communicate that monetary policy remains under the purview of the fomc  as we discussed
yesterday our primary goal is to set policy that yields the best economic outcomes for the economy
consistent with our dual mandate  i think our history demonstrates that the institutional structure of
the fomc and clearly articulated goals and methods yield the best policy  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i think president fisher at the last meeting
actually proposed that since we all knew where the economy was we just suspend discussion and
get on to what to do about it  forgive me for a sixweek reaction function here president fisher
but i tend to agree with that  i will be very brief  the points i will make have either been made or
will be made i am sure  laughter  we are facing dysfunctional financial markets a rapidly
weakening real economy and a very negative psychology a darkening mood  in addition i am
picking up in my contacts uncertainty or even questioning of what can be done and what good
anything close to conventional monetary policy will do  my board of directors advisory councils
and other contacts reflect deepening pessimism and many of those contacts confirm the view that
consumer activity and the economy in general pulled back dramatically in september and october
i have adjusted my forecast similarly to the greenbook and commercial forecasters  i think
it is very difficult at this point to forecast with any confidence that conditions will gel in a way
necessary for a recovery  the greenbook sees a somewhat sharper snapback by midyear reflecting
the influence of a fiscal stimulus than i am prepared at this time to project  our forecast assumes a
protracted period of weakness through all of 2009 somewhat more along the lines of the more
financial stress scenario in the greenbook
regarding financial markets i would just comment that the pressures on the hedge fund
sector have clearly not abated and may be intensifying  over the weekend we picked up rumors of
a fed intervention that has not been discussed here so i presume that it was just a rumor
nonetheless rumors were circulating that a major hedge fund group was about to collapse and that
our people were in so to speak over the weekend  as bill mentioned yesterday the madoff
scandal certainly has not helped the picture regarding hedge funds
regarding risks it is not my baseline scenario but the risk of deflation obviously cannot be
ignored and the apparent speed of disinflation is quite a concern  the atlanta staff prepared several
forecast scenarios and there were some plausible downside scenarios that really were quite ugly
so to preview later comments i think the balance of risks at this point is decidedly to the downside
and justifies a traumamanagement approachor in more normal terms a riskmanagement
approachof acting aggressively at this meeting  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you and if there has been any intervention in hedge
funds the chairman is unaware of it  laughter
mr lockhart  i am relieved to hear that
mr fisher  he just wanted you to know about it mr chairman
mr lacker  you said has been  laughter
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  the tenth districts economy like the others
has systematically worsened  layoffs are increasing  our retail sales are down  the housing
market is certainly not improving and manufacturing has weakened  in our two stronger areas
energy is showing a pretty good slowdown with these falloffs in prices and rigs are being stacked
the agricultural sector is also feeling the pressure as commodity prices fall  so it is uniformly poor
as far as the national economy and outlook go i have no major differences with the outlook that
has been presented by others  i would tell you that we have done different projections ourselves  i
think a lot depends on what will be developed on the fiscal side as we move from here and i am
kind of waiting to see about that
i do have one other comment and perhaps request as we think about this and it follows on
yesterdays conversation  it strikes me as i look broadly and see whats happening in our own
region that the intermediation process is broken as it goes through the banking industry and then
more broadly than that  the deleveraging process that is under way is actually acceleratingit is
worsening and complicating our ability to fix the intermediation process  as a result we as the
central bank are going around that process as we try to get credit working and i understand that
but it does have consequencessome good for those particular markets where were bringing
intermediation forward but also perhaps some not so good as other sectors are left behind in that
my point is that we really do have to focus in working on the fiscal side with the treasury or
whomever on fixing the broken intermediation process and that is the banking industry  i know
we are working with the tarp  it needs some additional work  but out of that comes my request
we spent a fair amount of time yesterday talking about the japanese experience  i wonder if we
wouldnt benefit if we looked at the nordic experience of the early 90show you go in take a
look at that and how you conduct policy around thatand have a discussion among ourselves
because i think there are some lessons there that we might learn to our benefit as we move forward
from here  thats a suggestion i have not just my report on the district  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  it was a good suggestion  i have looked at that
example and had a chance to talk with stefan ingves who is the governor of the central bank of
sweden and was very much involved in that  it was a very good and prompt response but it was
different from our current situation in that the banks were already mostly insolvent and no longer
functioning when the government intervened  they took the standard steps of taking off
nonperforming loansso the usual process  they still had a significant recession  i think the basic
lessons are there but we have some characteristics in this particular episodebanks still
functioning the complexity of the assets and so onthat make it even more difficult
mr hoenig  i agree with that but at the same time i see the similarity  when you dont
go in and try to drive it back quickly you get the japanese outcome of prolonging it  i dont know
where the banks are yet but i know that things are getting worse and that the intermediation process
is broken  so just maybe there is something inbetweensomething that can be done that forces
outcomes for some of these banks  even though they are not insolvent as such we have poured a
ton of equity into those institutions and i am not sure if we shouldnt have added some other
elements to that that might have helped on the other side  thats my point
chairman bernanke  if you can indulge just one more observation which is that
one thing we learn from these episodes is that the political economy matters tremendously  the
public is very reluctant to get involved in putting money into banks and only when they become
persuaded that doing so is essential do you get that result  in japan it took a long time  in sweden it
was much quicker and thats an important element  a twohander from president bullard  yes
mr bullard  may i just make one comment on that  for those of you who have not
read about the nordic experience seppo honkapohja who is a member of the board of the bank of
finland has given a speech within the last two months  you can probably go to the bank of
finland web page  there may be other information but that is just one summary from a person
who lived through it and has been involved in policy for a long time
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  in my view cumulative recessionary dynamics
are deeply entrenched with mounting job losses leading to weaker consumer spending tighter
credit more job losses and so on and this nasty set of economic linkages is gaining momentum
like the greenbook i anticipate a long period of decline and in fact the consensus forecast is that
were now in the longest and one of the deepest postwar recessions
i hope that a recovery will begin in the middle of next year but the risks seem skewed to the
downside for several reasons  first compared with the average recession we face unusually
difficult financial conditions  my contacts complain bitterly that even firms with sterling credit
ratings have difficulty securing credit  some banks appear reluctant to lend because financial
markets are skeptical about the quality of their assets and their reported net worth  an accounting
joke concerning the balance sheets of many financial institutions is now making the rounds and it
summarizes the situation as follows  on the lefthand side nothing is right and on the righthand
side nothing is left  laughter  the second factor skewing risk to the downside is the unusually
fearful and pessimistic psychology thats developed  one director who heads a national department
chain predicts carnage in the retail sector after yearend as stores close after trying to hold on
through the holidays  although some stores have been able to keep sales up to reasonable levels
heavy price discounting will translate into huge losses  businesses have also generally turned very
cautious hoarding cash and slashing capital spending  a third factor that worries me is that in
contrast to many past recessions this one is global in nature and the fact that its a worldwide
slowdownwhile lowering commodity prices which is goodis also going to make it harder for
us to pull out
turning just very briefly to the labor market the beveridge curve chart that stephanie
presented during her briefing suggests that we have seen an unusually large increase in the
unemployment rate recently in comparison with the decline in job openings at least in the jolts
data  i think one interpretation might be that the unemployment rate has risen in part because we
have had an unusual rise in labor force participation during this recession  labor force participation
has been higher than would be expected particularly for three demographic groups  young adults
married women and older workers nearing retirement  analysis by my staff estimates that this rise
in participation could reflect behavioral responses to unusual credit constraints and wealth declines
specifically young adults aged 20 to 24 years appear to be entering the labor force in unusual
numbers and that might reflect diminished access to student loans  similarly more married women
are entering the labor force and thats a possible reflection of diminished access to home equity and
credit card loans  finally an unusually large number of older workers are in the labor market and
that may reflect the negative wealth shock associated with the collapse of housing values and the
plummeting stock market  all in all i expect the anomalous increase in labor force participation to
put continued upward pressure on the unemployment rate
with respect to inflation developments since our october meeting have again lowered the
outlook  im particularly concerned about the disinflationary effect of actual and prospective
economic slack  during the postwar period core pce inflation has actually fallen at least 
percentage point in every single year in which unemployment has averaged 7 percent or more
given that in each of the next two years the unemployment rate is predicted to average at least 8
percent it seems quite likely that by the end of 2010 core inflation will have fallen at least 1
percentage points  that creates a very real risk of deflation  so under these circumstances i
definitely believe that we should do everything in our power to stimulate aggregate demand
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  as gloomy as our last meeting was
conditions have deteriorated substantially further since then  practically all of my contacts
reported that economic events had turned sharply lower once again in the last three to five
weeks  this goes well beyond the auto sector and other parts of the district that have been
struggling for some time  the most optimistic comment from my directors was this at least
iowa is going to hell slower than everywhere else  laughter  it is tough to follow that
accounting joke you knowthat was good  more seriously the most optimistic theme i heard
from a number of business contacts went something like this we are conserving cash and
furiously cutting costs by yearend  but we hope to pause in the first quarter and take stock of
where conditions appear to be heading  then we will act accordingly  frankly i doubt such a
waitandsee pause in costcutting will occur that soon
for the purposes of this meeting and our actions over the next few months i agree with
the main thrust of the greenbook projection  we are facing large contractions in the next two
quarters and i dont expect to see meaningfully positive growth before the fourth quarter  i
think we need substantial further accommodation after todays meeting  i see the timing and the
size of those actions for the most part being shaped by the large recessionary forces in train and
the enormous financial headwinds
the disinflationary forces in play clearly are strong but currently i do not expect that
they will prove large enough to generate outright deflation  in terms of my earlier question about
the greenbook forecastas i understand the way it was put togetherif the quantitative easing
helps monetary policy would be somewhere between the funds rate at zero and the optimal
control  so in fact it would be a little better than i first suspected  inflation would be somewhat
above that path  that might be a useful benchmark to watch for if we are fortunate enough for
the forecast to be that stable but time will tell
quantitative easing should also lead to an increase in the monetary base  i dont know if
there was any lasting conflict between your comments and president lackers but i think that
what we have contemplated will lead to the base increasing and that will generate expectations
about inflation beyond just taylorrule dynamics i would guess  in fact there is certainly a lot
of discussion and criticism out there that our balance sheet is going to lead to large inflationary
risks  i dont share that given how i think we will unwind the programs  but that certainly
would help and it would move us in that direction  so i will keep an open mind on deflationary
risk  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well as just about everyone has saidand i
certainly agreethe nearterm outlook is grim  virtually all the anecdotes of any consequence
that i have received recently have been negative  payroll employment has been obviously
dropping significantly and if you look at the trajectory if that kind of trajectory continues for
any length of time beyond the next month or so it will surpass the declines in employment that
we typically have seen certainly in the last three recessions
my outlook for the real economy for the next five or six quarters has essentially the same
profile as the current greenbook  i do have a somewhat better recovery starting in the second or
third quarter of 2010 but at this point i have to admit that it is more hope than conviction  it is
based on a diminution of many of the factors that are currently restraining the economy and
producing the significant contraction that is under way
as far as the inflation outlook is concerned i dont have quite as much disinflation as the
greenbook does but i wouldnt say that we are all that far apart at this point  one footnote to
that  i do get a lot of comments and questions along the lines that president evans mentioned
gee with that expansion in your balance sheet with all those reserves arent we going to have
a lot of inflation in the future  maybe i ought to say yes to that question
chairman bernanke  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i will be brief  in the eighth district there
is a clear and sharp downturn as in the national picture  there is a clear turn to survival
strategies and you really see that when key ceos and other figures start talking about lower
capital expenditures for 2009 cutting the lower levels in 2008 in half or more  i think thats very
consistent with the greenbook  the effects on our district from any auto restructuring may be
substantial and that is something i have ratcheted up here in the last few months  a common
theme among all contactsand it echoes some of what has been said around the table hereis
that rate cuts at this point will have no effect on the macroeconomy  their thinking is well of
course since shortterm treasuries are trading at zeroi think onemonth treasuries actually hit
zero here a bit agothey are not going to have any effect  but as governor duke pointed out
yesterday and i think this is an important concern the impact on bank profitability may be
substantial exactly at the wrong time  first vice president cumming picked that up too  i think
that is a concern  i think it suggests favoring an option of deemphasizing the federal funds rate
as a target at this meeting as we will get to in the policy discussion  but then you might not
trigger this prime rate cut that would otherwise normally accompany a major move by the fed
on the national picture i expect a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter and the first
quarter  expectations are extremely negative now and extremely fluid  i think that is probably
the biggest factor facing us going forward into 2009  the expectations are so fluid that they
portend a deflationary environment if we do not control the situation very soon  i am also very
concerned about the global aspect because we havent really seen this kind of coordination
across the globe in the rapid movement to probably zero interest rates  i dont think we really
know what that means going forward  we are going to be looking at bad news coming in at least
until summer and we have no way at this point to signal a reaction to that bad news via normal
policy  that is the gravity of the situation and in some ways it is the downside of a preemptive
policy  had i been on the committee earlier this year i would have supported the preemptive
policy to try to avoid this situation  but one downside of it is that you do not have the ability to
continually react as bad news comes in
in sum i think we are moving to a japanesestyle deflationary zero nominal interest rate
situation at an alarming pace  to stay in the game and control expectations we need a volcker
like transformation something likealthough the situation is differentthe 79 announcement
which knocked privatesector priors off the idea that they should trigger all reactions to
announcements on nominal interest rates  you need a dramatic move that emphasizes this new
reality  continued focus on the federal funds rate at this point would not face that reality
above all we have to establish in the minds of the private sectorand maybe in our own
minds as wellthat we control mediumterm inflation  we should take the attitude that we can
create the inflation we need to stay near target by one means or another  i think actually this
may be an excellent time to set the inflation target although it sounds as though we are drifting
away from that  but if i can argue for it for a few minutes here i think it might have an
important effect on the navigation through the recession during 2009  of course in normal
times to undertake some action like that we would want a lot of study and we would want to
have time to talk it through with the congress and other interested parties as we would for
interest on reserves  but we dont have that luxury right now  we want to take the action now to
help control the situation and i think we could sell that as a work in progress which can be
modified later  but we do want to keep these expectations under control in this very fluid
situation  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman thank you  president rosengren talked about micro
behavior and at the beginning first vice president cumming talked about the hunkeringdown
mentality  i have been focused on the microeconomic behavioral responses to our current
situation  as one of my ceo contacts outside my region said we are basically all in his words
chasing the anvil down the stairs and that is that the behavioral responses of both businesses
and consumers are driving us into a slowgrowth culdesac and a deflationary trap
one ceo i talked with was quite pleased that he could borrow 40 million over the
weekend for a total of 250  that is great from a commercial paper standpoint he is an a1p1
issuer  however were he to go to the longerterm debt markets it would cost him 7 percent
so they can finance their daily operations easily  but in terms of their longterm planning they
and others are respondingand i see this uniformly across my contactsout of concern about
the high cost of debt and the spreads over treasuries by doing what any businesswoman or
businessman would do  they are planning on less capex and they are cutting back on their
plans for acquisitions of the weak which they would like to take advantage of under the current
circumstances  they are also responding to the situation by cutting back on head count  so
chris there is very much a hunkeringdown mentality not just in my district but across the
country  that leads to further economic weaknessthat plus the fact that they are chary about
issuing and paying for things with shares in a very weak market  i am hearing more and more
worries about their pension liabilities and how they are going to be able to finance those
obviously this is leading to the kind of economic behavior that none of us would like to see
on the consumer side you see a similar behavioral pattern  it seems that after black
friday according to my sources there was weaker behavior than one had expected  the
spending pulse data that i get from one of the large credit card companies reflect what one would
expect under these circumstancesthat is a shift to nonbranded products smaller purchases of
items a rotation out of credit cards to debit cards and cash payments according to the pay cycle
and overall an expectation on both the business and the consumer side that things will get
cheaper if they wait longer and they postpone either their capex or their consumer purchases
the one ray of sunshine that i was able to find is that one large law firm cravath has
announced that it is not increasing its billing rates in 2009 laughter and other law firms are
actually planning to respond by cutting their billing rates  one woman whom i know
summarized it this way  this is the divorce from hell  my net worth has been cut in half but i
am still stuck with my husband  laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  i am not going to even try to top either of those anecdotes or jokes  i agree
certainly with the thrust of the comments around the room  the economy is in a steep decline
there was a break in confidence somewhere in september that took what had been a gradual
decline in employment production and output and made it much much much much steeper
the feedback loop between the financial markets and the real economy just intensifiedturned
up many many notches at that time  households and businesses as president fisher was
remarking are very worried and they are acting in a way to protect themselves  they have cut
back on spending and they have cut back on lending
i think the response of businesses is particularly interesting  they responded very very
rapidly to the falloff in demand with cuts in employment and production  so we are not even
getting the sort of automatic stabilizer effect that we usually get from a buildup in inventories
and a bit of labor hoarding as demand drops  thus businesses actions are just accentuating the
weakness  as many have remarked the weakness is global everywhere including in emerging
market economies where as shaghil showed us the inflow of capital has slowed substantially
there is no real region to lead the globe out of this swamp we are in
financial markets remain very strained  i think of particular concern are the
securitization markets  when they are not operating a lot of credit to households and businesses
wont be available at the same time that the banks are tightening up very sharply  we have seen
in these charts that household and business borrowers with anything less than very high credit
scores are just finding credit either extraordinarily expensive or unavailable  as a consequence
a very sizable output gap has opened up  i think we can see that the decline is going to remain
steep for some time  the multiplieraccelerator effects of the drop in demand we have seen over
the last couple of months have to feed back through consumption and investment  i dont think
we have seen the full effect of the tightening in credit conditions and the decline in wealth from
the end of september on
you can see the continuing economic decline in the initial claims data the weekly ip and
the anecdotes we heard around the table on sales and financial markets are going to remain
impaired for a while despite our best efforts to open them up  there are huge losses in the
capital of intermediaries to absorb so folks will be very cautious about making loans  as long as
investors savers households and businesses see the economy in steep decline the fear that is
gripping the financial markets and the economy isnt going to abate very rapidly
inflation is decelerating across a broad front and that is going to continue  economic
slack will be increasing cost pressures will be abating and the ability to pass through cost
increases will be highly constrained  so far longerterm inflation expectations seem to have
been reasonably well anchored though they are very hard to measure  but i agree with president
bullard that we are going to need to watch this very very closely for signs of a disinflationary
dynamic taking hold  i think what happens to the economy and inflation over the latter part of
next year is extremely uncertain  we have huge changes in forecasts in very short periods of
time and i suspect like the staff that the improvement in financial markets and the rebound in
the economy will be gradual in part reflecting the limited power of monetary policy  but even if
we thought that a sharper rebound next year was a distinct possibility i dont think it would
matter very much for our policy purposes here today  the trajectory the economic decline the
extent of the output gap and the degree of disinflation in train all imply that our task at this time
is to try to limit economic weakness  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  several quick points  first the latest leg of
deterioration which began in midseptember is showing few signs of abating as governor
kohn suggested  i think the november retail sales data look like a head fake  revisions to
september and october as the greenbook suggested make us think that november was
probably worse and december worse still  so in some ways i think our job is difficult because
the weakness seems to be accelerating
globally the deterioration is found everywhere  the data are playing catchup  i am less
optimistic that foreign activity will perform as well as the greenbook suggests and that foreign
activity will respond in 2010 because of lags in policy response and less flexibility in their labor
markets their product markets and their political markets  the depth and the degree of the fall
in data and policymakers expectations overseas particularly in asia are remarkable shocking
even and i think we are likely to see policy responses there that are hard to judge but are likely
to be changing pretty quickly
in terms of us households real household net worth has collapsed about 15 percent or
so through the end of the third quartermore than in 2001 and more than in 1974  ongoing
declines in financial markets and house prices are likely to depress wealth further in the fourth
quarter and beyond  socalled savings from lower energy prices look as though they pale in
comparison to what else is happening to us household balance sheets  as we have discussed
before every asset everywhere in the world is being revalued and households are feeling it
in terms of financial markets i will underscore what dan suggested and what bill
suggested yesterdaythe significant overall deterioration in conditions  we all have a tendency
at this point in the year to say well there are a lot of yearend effects and we are not going to
really know until we get through this period  we have had baby versions of yearend effects in
the quarterend effects in almost every meeting that we have had and i have been a little
dismissive of those  i would say that there does appear to be more yearend stuff going on in
these markets than there has been since this period of weakness began
if you think about the two former investment banks that have balance sheets and year
ends that close at the end of november this is the last quarter in which they will have that  they
have had more demands and more interest in in effect renting out their balance sheet as their
customers balance sheets end in december than they ever have had  the prices that are being
paid for them to rent their balance sheetsto take exposures off the balance sheets of their
clientssuggest that maybe just maybe the yearend effects are more significant this time than
they were in the previous six or seven quarters  it doesnt give me a ton of optimism but in
january market functioning could look a little better and i think that would be the best news we
have seen for a while  you have heard me say before that until we see market functioning
improving and until we see these markets clearing it is unrealistic to expect the real economy to
turn  i still think that is true
turning to two final items inflation and the fiscal packageon the inflation front
although there are risks in this environment for prices to fall below those consistent with price
stability i still believe that these risks are not likely to materialize in the medium term  so i take
stock of but ultimately discount the greenbooks deflation alternative simulation  on the fiscal
front more bigger faster is what is going to happen inevitably to what i would describe as the
first fiscal package of 2009  the trillion dollar number over two years which is now being
bandied about is larger than the greenbook forecast and looks almost assured with a greater
share going to the states in my view than in the greenbook forecast more toward public
infrastructure perhaps less toward tax cuts on a relative basis than in the greenbook but bigger
i would be surprised if that initial package isnt supplemented through larger annual
appropriations and another stimulus package if not by the end of 2009 then by 2010  as a
result my own sense would be that the 2010 deficit is likely to be significantly larger than the
greenbook forecast  now knowing the precise contours of this fiscal package is tough  i would
say the only good news is that the duration of the slowdown is likely to suggest that the fiscal
package may end up being somewhat more permanent in its incentives and somewhat more
permanent in its effects and i suspect because of that it is likely to provide some good news to
the economy  but i wouldnt expect that to happen in the next twelve or eighteen months other
than perhaps a bit of benefit on the arithmetic  in terms of changing the overall contour pace
and strength of the resilient economy i would say that is still quite a way off  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks  president lockharts forecast about what members would
say about the forecasts i think has turned out to be right and i certainly dont want to disappoint
laughter  so i agree with what others have said and i think most everything has been said
about the intensification of the recessionary flames around the world  what i will do is just
quickly look at it from the perspective of part of the banks balance sheets and the things that
may not be left on those balance sheets to just underscore how i think this is going to be
protracted for the financial services sector for a while
on the consumer side as many people have mentioned the very sharp step down in
employment the very large job losses the increases in the unemployment rate and the decreases
in wealth have been leading to very significant increases in consumer delinquencies and very
high roll ratesthat is people who become delinquent rolling directly into chargeoff  this is
happening not only on the credit card side and on a lot of different parts of the consumer side but
also in mortgages for which we are seeing exactly the same kind of thing  although the most
recent numbers that came out from the mortgage bankers association suggested some
stabilization in foreclosure starts that actually had more to do with the laws in various states
slowing down that process rather than any real change in the underlying economics  of course
we still have a lot of option arm types of resets that will be coming through in 2009  so a lot of
pressure is there and as was mentioned housing prices are still going down
we havent yet seen as much of an actual downturn in commercial real estate but
undoubtedly that will occur as fewer people are shopping in shopping malls and as a lot of other
commercial real estate projects dont have the payoffs that people expect  also an enormous
amount of refinancing is going to be necessary during the next few months and having to pay an
additional 600 or 800 basis points really changes the economics of a lot of these projects if they
can even get the refinancing at an additional 600 to 800 basis points  for leveraged loans
another piece of the balance sheet as people have said there is very little activity going on in
takeovers  the only positive there is that the failure of certain deals has taken some of the
pressure off certain banks balance sheets
on the commercial and industrial side as we have noted the investmentgrade market for
debt issuance seems to have maintained itself but that is really one of the few markets that is
there  if any challenges come in there it could be very very difficult for firms to finance
investment  we certainly have seen the spreads going up recently even if the volume has come
back a bit  but as we have seen in the noninvestmentgrade part the spreads have blown out
and the financing is not there  that tends to be a little more of what many banks have on their
balance sheets and so i think that is representative of the challenges that the banks are going to
have  that suggests that we have a lot of challenges in banking and financial institutions
balance sheets to come that have nothing to do with any particular level of assets or accounting
issues but just real economic factors that are going to be affecting the balance sheets  so the
credit headwinds are going to be very very strong for a number of quarters going forward
the points that president rosengren made are extremely important ones  we have to
think about as we move to the zero lower bound how that is going to affect behavior of
financial institutions  certainly the staff memos were good on addressing some issues but i
think that other things that have been mentioned like imposing minimums or floors on interest
rates on loans we have not carefully analyzed or really understand well  there may be a variety
of other responses that we dont understand well that we really do need to get a better handle on
both to see how the effects of traditional monetary policy changethe transmission
mechanismand to think about the nontraditional aspects of monetary policy that we would be
undertaking by using our balance sheet  so where can we use it most effectively  if the
financial institutions are changing their behavior we need to be cognizant of that and think about
where we need to try to unfreeze markets if we are going to be using our balance sheet in that
way and i think it is very important that we do so
i will underscore also what other people have said about the great importance of clearly
articulating what we are doing  it is not that we have given up and that the fed is impotent but
that through changes in our balance sheet we can be quite potent in particular markets and in
general  that then brings us to whether we can be too potent and raise inflation concerns
exactly as president stern said we should be so lucky to have that as our problem  we do need
to make sure that we maintain credibility and show that we feel that we can and do act to offset
concerns about deflation  it is very difficult to tell what the pricelevel evolution is likely to be
over the next year but i do think that there is a real concern about that and we have to take that
very very seriously going forward  i think we would obviously be able to get out of these
different programs and we need to think about getting out of them at some point  but right now
the key is getting into the programs using the nontraditional approaches to make sure that we
offset a deflationary psychology that could develop  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  yesterday i talked about the income statement
of the banks  i would like to talk a bit about the balance sheets now  up to this point for the
small and mediumsized community banks it has been pretty much business as usual  but now
even those banks are finding it increasingly difficult to lend  community banks and regional
banks are trying but it is tough  funding is tight and expensive  it costs 3 percent to keep a
cd and 4 percent and up to attract one  the smaller banks are especially bitter about pricing
against citi and those nonbanks that have recently converted to bank holding company and thrift
holding company charters
for a bank to qualify for tarp funding the examiners are raising the bar on noncore
funding  one bank reported a meeting with both the occ and the fed in which the occ
criticized and the fed defended the banks use of the discount window  examiners are raising
the bar on capital  12 is the new 10 on riskbased capital  borrowers are not in nearly as good
shape as they were  the best credits are choosing not to borrow and they are adjusting their
plans so that they get through on their own cash flow  so the requests coming into the banks are
more and more likely to be desperation requestsloans to cover operating losses or to meet
payroll  cracks are appearing in ci loans  some banks are exiting loans to entire industries
especially auto dealers marine and construction trades and retail  the performance of
commercial real estate especially retail properties is deteriorating  hospitality is falling off
rapidly and office buildings are expected to be next  apartments are still okay and all of this is
in addition to problems with construction loans  lower mortgage rates are helping refinance but
it is not the best time of the year to judge what it is going to happen with purchase activity
there are still issues with jumbos with down payments and with requirements for very high
credit scores
as we have talked here it occurs to me that perhaps the traditional tools of monetary
policy are all directed at bank credit and the strongest nontraditional tools that we have are
addressed more to the securitization marketsthe talf and the purchase of gses  in this
instance most of the problems are not really caused by a cutback in bank lending but a complete
collapse of the securitization markets and so that is why these tools may be more necessary
i asked questions also about the tarp capital and got different reactions  several
bankers said that they didnt need it they were scared off by the ability of the congress to
change the terms at any time and they had elected not to take it  some took it because they
thought they could leverage it into good business  some took it as cheap insurance  some took
it to be in a position to acquire in what they see as the necessary weeding out of weaker players
and they think that should happen sooner rather than later  several complained about delays in
providing terms for smaller banks  every single bank was adamant about the evils of markto
market accounting and otherthantemporary impairment  there is a big diversion between
market losses and credit losses so that leads to bankers who are afraid to buy securities because
they are worried about further marks as the markets go down  but they are also unwilling to sell
securities because they dont believe that the current market price adequately reflects the
potential credit losses  there is some speculation that the marktomarket losses will absorb all
of the tarp capital that was just injected and i think that is something we might want to
calculate as fourthquarter reports come out  then the next big writedown is on servicing
portfolios as lower rates spur refinancing activities  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  and thanks everyone for a very concise but
also very informative roundtable  why dont we take a coffee break until 1130  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene have a brief summary of our go
round and then i will make just a few additional comments  the participants noted that the
economic downturn has intensified sharply recently with significant downside risks to the
outlook  recessionary dynamics have set in with interplays among real and financial variables
the economy is likely to contract through early next year with considerable uncertainty about
subsequent developments  consumption employment and production indicators have weakened
further  financial conditions remain very strained with improvement in some areas but many
the same or worse  the global economy has also slowed markedly
looking more specifically at different sectors credit conditions continue to tighten with
credit lines not being renewed and banks including smaller banks hunkering down
securitization markets are still largely dysfunctional  the overall deleveraging process continues
to be a powerful drag on activity  delinquencies are increasing implying greater credit losses
for banks and other lenders with small businesses being among the borrowers facing tighter
conditions  banks continue to face intense balance sheet pressures and are reluctant to lend or
make markets and feedback effects from worsening credit quality to the balance sheets of
financial institutions are evident
regarding the consumer spending continues to contract as households face ongoing
pressures with respect to wealth income credit availability and job security  psychology is very
negative and luxury and discretionary expenditures are being cut back  labor market
developments have been negative as well with accelerating job losses and participation finally
declining after remaining high for a period of time  the latest housing numbers suggest a
continued contraction in that sector  the fall in mortgage rates has sparked some refinancing and
purchase mortgage applications but the longerterm impact on housing demand is not yet
evident  nonresidential construction is projected to fall significantly reflecting poor
fundamentals and tight credit  federal fiscal policy will likely provide aid to states including
funds for infrastructure but the size and the timing of the economic impact of that policy remain
uncertain
manufacturing production continues to slow along with new orders capital spending
and business expectations mining and drilling activities have been reacting to the decline in
commodity prices as has agricultural activity to some extent  export demand has weakened
with the sharp slowing in the global economy of recent months and the strengthening of the
dollar since the summer  the sharp global slowdown including emerging markets will make
recovery more difficult  manufacturing surveys show that firms expect considerable nearterm
weakness and declining pricing power
finally inflation looks set to decline significantly reflecting falling commodity prices
rising slack limited pricing power and falling inflation expectations  participants cited the risk
that inflation could fall below desired levels  that is just a very quick summary  any
comments
let me make just a few additional comments but i wont add i think a great deal of
insight to our discussion  i will just note for the record here that the nber has finally
recognized that a recession began in december 2007  i said in the christmas tree lighting
ceremony that they also recognized that christmas was on december 25 last year  laughter
the committee was a little more forwardthinking  we began cutting rates of course in
september 2007 and did 100 basis points of cuts in january 2008
despite our efforts this recession in terms of duration and depth is likely to be equal to
or greater than the two largest previous postwar recessions those in 197475 and 198182
there are a number of reasons that may be the case and some of them were already discussed by
the staff  the financial conditions are the most obvious difference between this recession and the
earlier ones  a number of previous recessions have had financial headwinds of one type or
another  for example the current financial crisis and housing correction bear some family
relationship to the stock market decline and the capital overhang in the 2001 recession  but
overall the financial aspects of this episode are i think much more serious than in previous
cases  to cite two aspects  one as governor warsh noted there has been a big impact on
household wealth  the flow of funds accounts show a decline in nominal wealth of about
11 percent in the last year or as he said a decline in real wealth of about 15 percent  this is
going to lead to an increase in saving which would be desirable in the longer term but in the
short term is going to create dislocation  two this financial crisis has affected the
intermediation of credit far more severely than any other episode since the 1930s  we have
already seen a big impact on intermediary capital and bank activity  the deleveraging process is
continuing  it is very intense  again reduced risktaking deleveraging all of those things are
not necessarily bad but the adjustment process is a very difficult one
a second reason that this recession could well be more severe than the previous ones has
to do with the cyclical position of monetary policy a fact also noted by the staff  the 197475
and 198182 recessions were basically generated by a tightening of monetary policy and when
the federal reserve decided to let up essentially conditions began to rebound  obviously in
this case other factors have driven the downturn  monetary policy was proactive in trying to
promote recovery  but given where we are today at the zero lower bound we are unable to ease
policy in the way that we saw in those previous episodes  this suggests as others have noted
the need for additional policy actions either on our part or by the fiscal authorities to get the
economy moving again
finally a third reason that i think this episode is particularly severe is the global nature of
the downturn which a number of people have also noted  it has always been said that if the
united states sneezes the rest of the world catches cold  so there has always been a certain
amount of coherence or synchronicity between us downturns and those around the world  but
the extent of the global downturn this time is really quite exceptional  it is striking that global
growth over the past few years has been between 4 and 5 percent and now the greenbook is
looking at a 16 percent decline for global activity in the fourth quarter and a decline of about
06 percent in the first quarter  that is quite a big difference between what we might think of as
potential and actual growth
so as i said there are a number of reasons to think that this is going to be a very severe
episode and that we are far from being at the turning point  i wont go through the sectors  we
have all discussed consumption employment housing commercial real estate and financial
markets  these are all aspects of the downturn that continue to be exceptional and very
worrisome as we look forward
i will make just a couple of comments about inflation or disinflation  the forecast is for
significant disinflationperhaps not deflation although deflation is easily within the standard
errors of the forecast  a number of factors may affect this forecast or create risks on both sides
stephanie talked about structural unemployment perhaps being a factor that might make the
effect of slack less than otherwise  on the other hand there may be some evidence that the
phillips curve is steeper when unemployment is highthat is recessions tend to have a greater
impact on inflation than do small changes in growth  that only goes to say that there is a lot of
uncertainty about exactly how far the inflation rate will fall  although we might reach a
technical deflation i guess it is worth pointing out here that there is nothing special about zero
that is from this point on any further disinflation will have the effects of making a given
nominal interest rate a higher real interest rate  it is making monetary policy de facto tighter and
perhaps having debt deflation effects as the real value of debts and debt payments becomes
greater as inflation falls  because we are already at the zero lower bound obviously that
constraint is already in play  so i think we shouldnt focus too much or focus the public too
much on the deflation line on that zero number  it is not all that consequential  rather the
disinflation processand a very low rate of inflationis a source of concern
just to summarize i dont think my outlook differs very significantly from what i have
heard around the table  i think the issues are what we do about it and in that spirit we should
turn now to the policy round  so let me turn to brian to introduce the monetary policy
alternatives
mr madigan4  thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  this package includes the october policy statement draft policy statements for this meeting and associated draft directives to the desk  alternatives a and b have been revised somewhat relative to the versions that were distributed in the bluebook partly reflecting yesterdays discussion  in addition as shown in bold in paragraph 1 of alternative a it seemed appropriate in current circumstances to incorporate a  sentence on financial conditions as the committee has done in its recent statements the same sentence has also been included in alternative b  we have presented a total of four policy alternatives for your consideration  given the unusual circumstances

4  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 4
the statements associated with all four alternatives depart to some degree from the statements that have typically been issued by the committee in recent years
alternative a represents the sharpest departure  rather than starting with the policy action the statement would begin by describing the economic situation noting that the economic outlook has weakened further  it goes on to say that inflation pressures have diminished quickly and that inflation could decline for a time below the rates that best foster economic growth and price stability  reflecting what seemed to be a consensus yesterday the sentence in brackets articulating a mediumterm inflation objective has been dropped  we have also bracketed the clause indicating that inflation could drop for a time to very low levels partly because some  committee members might not yet be convinced that such an outcome is a serious risk at this time and to avoid raising such concerns prematurely
the third paragraph would indicate that the committee judges that it is not useful to set a specific target for the funds rate  it would explain that judgment by noting that as a result of the large volume of reserves provided through liquidity programs the federal funds rate has already declined to very low levels  it would also note that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time avoiding the use of the near zero phrase  the clause weak economic conditions are likely to warrant implies some conditionality but the conditions under which rates would be raised are not spelled out
the fourth paragraph would set out a general plan for implementing unconventional policy to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy  it reiterates that the federal reserve will be buying agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and indicates that those purchases could be ramped up if conditions warrant  it indicates further that the fomc is evaluating the potential benefits of buying longerterm treasuries  it also indicates that the federal reserve will be considering other ways of using its balance sheet to support credit markets and economic activity  we suggested dropping the word actively to avoid a suggestion that a new facility will be announced imminently
over recent months the discount rate has moved in lockstep with the target federal funds rate at a level  percentage point above that rate and very recently the rates on required and excess reserves have been set essentially by formula equal to the target federal funds rate  because a target federal funds rate would not be established under this alternative those formulas could not be used  we have suggested that under this alternative the board act to lower the discount rate 75 basis points to
 percent and that the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances be reduced to  percent  the positive interest rates on reserves would maintain some upward pressure albeit perhaps modest on the federal funds rate consistent with a view that there are some costs in terms of financial market performance of driving the funds rate literally to zero  the discount rate of  percent would maintain a fairly small penalty for borrowing at the window
in certain substantive respects alternative b the next page is similar to alternative a  most important federal funds would trade at about the same very low rates as in alternative a partly because the discount and reserves interest rates discussed in paragraph 5 would be set at the same levels as in alternative a  also the wording of the rationale section of the statementparagraphs 2 and 3is essentially identical to the corresponding paragraphs for alternative a  however alternative b differs from alternative a by explicitly setting a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to  percent as shown in paragraph 1  we have restructured the introduction to the discussion of unconventional policy measures in paragraph 5 so that it is generally similar to the corresponding paragraph in alterative a  also the final sentence of alternative a paragraph 4 has been substituted as the last sentence of alternative b paragraph 5
both alternatives a and b would put the committee clearly in the realm of unconventional policymaking going forward  the various policy interest rates would be reduced to very low levels several unconventional policy tools will already have been implemented and the statements would indicate clearly that further unconventional tools could be deployed  the committee might choose either of these alternatives if members had an outlook similar to that of the greenbook or if they were especially concerned about the downside risks  both alternatives would constitute somewhat more vigorous policy action than market participants anticipate for this meeting and accordingly it is possible that financial markets would respond favorably  on the other hand there is some risk that confidence could be undermined if the main message that comes through is that the federal reserve is out of ammunition  as was noted yesterday such alternatives place a premium on fed communications that convincingly indicate that the federal reserve can still provide monetary stimulus
under alternative c on the next page the committee would reduce the federal funds target rate 50 basis points today  the committee might choose this option if it agreed that further monetary stimulus is warranted by the evolving economic outlook but was unsure that it would be necessary or desirable to reduce the target federal funds rate to around zero  the rationale for the action presented in paragraphs 2 and 3 would be fairly similar to those of alternatives a and b  paragraph 4 notes the downside risks to the outlook and indicates that the committee will use all available tools to promote its dual objectives suggesting that the committee will consider further reductions in the target federal funds rate and that further liquidity measures could be forthcoming  you could finetune the message regarding the federal funds rate by explicitly indicating that you are willing to or not willing to cut the funds rate further  under this alternative we have assumed that the discount rate would be lowered in line with the target federal funds rate to 75 basis points the draft included in the bluebook erroneously indicated that the rate would be lowered to 50 basis points  because the fomc would set a target rate under this alternative we have assumed that the reserves interest rates would continue to be set via the existing formulas so that those rates would move down to  percent absent further changes to the target funds rate  as bill noted yesterday although these interest rates on
reserves would provide some upward pressure on the funds rate that pressure is likely to be more than offset by the large supply of reserves and paragraph 7 notes that federal funds are likely to trade below  percent  although this approach provides a straightforward expectation for the funds rate it has an unappealing aspect in that the committee would be changing its target while simultaneously admitting that the target will not be hit implicitly raising the question of the meaning of the target
nonetheless this statement is likely consistent overall with market expectations and a pronounced market reaction one way or the other seems unlikely
under alternative d the committee would keep the target federal funds rate at 1 percent  the rationale portion of the statement would acknowledge that the near term outlook has deteriorated and that significant downside risks are present
however the statement would note that the broad range of policy actions taken in recent months should help over time to improve credit conditions and support a return to moderate growth  the statement would recognize that the federal funds rate would likely average significantly below the target for some time but it would not imply that a further reduction of the target rate is being contemplated  it thus suggests that the committee would seek to return the actual federal funds rate to
1 percent over time  overall this statement would surprise market participants considerably both in terms of the decision regarding the target funds rate and in suggesting that further monetary policy stimulus through conventional or unconventional policy is unlikely
the final two pages of the package provide draft directives to the desk that incorporate some changes relative to the versions that were included in the bluebook the directive for alternative a would provide some quantitative guidance for the desks open market operations while reserving some role for an assessment of evolving market conditions specifically the language that the committee directs the desk to purchase gse debt and agencyguaranteed mbs with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing markets  the timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector  by the end of the second quarter of next year the desk is expected to purchase up to 100 billion in housingrelated gse debt and up to 500 billion in agencyguaranteed mbs  the directive would not specify a target range for the federal funds rate while that for alternative b would  the directive for alternative a would state explicitly that the committee has suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate and that it expects federal funds to trade at exceptionally low levels the directive for b establishes the fed funds range of 0 to  percent  in line with one of the points raised yesterday that the size and the composition of our entire balance sheet affect the federal reserves monetary policy stance the final sentence of the revised directives for alternatives a and b states an expectation that the soma manager and the committees secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the systems balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committees objectives of maximum employment and price stability
the directive for alternative c on the next page is generally similar to that for alternative b  but it would acknowledge that federal funds are likely to trade below the  percent target rate set under this alternative  the directive for alternative d would include a similar recognition but with a target federal funds rate of 1 percent in addition this alternative would not provide specific guidance on open market purchases  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions for brian  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  brian the first sentence in alternative b
says the federal open market committee decided today to establish a target range for the
federal funds rate of 0 to  percent  in the staff analysis of various options for implementing
interest on excess reserves i think option 4 was the one that is closest to the reality of what we
are implementing nowjust a straight interest rate on excess reserves and an overprovision of
reserves to drive it down to the floor  in that analysis the staff anticipated that it would be a
floor which it turned out not to be  but it anticipated that with that floor in place the effective
funds rate would generally be above the floor and it envisioned choosing a rate on excess
reserves  point below our target rate  so do you envision in this that we would have to take any
measures if suddenly the downward forces on the effective rate would bring the funds rate
above   or is this just under the supposition that it would take a while and that it is unlikely to
get above   you see back in the early analysis there were forces that you believed would lead
it above  so i am wondering how you are thinking about it
mr madigan  president lacker the forces that we were thinking would bring it
above  were largely a risk premiumthe difference between federal funds which have some
amount of credit risk and deposits at the federal reserve which of course do not  i think we
would not anticipate that we would need to do anything very different from what we have been
doingjust continue to provide a very large amount of reserves which is a byproduct of our
liquidity provisions  with the interest rate on balances set at  percent that configuration of
balances and rates would result in a federal funds rate somewhere in the range of 0 to 
mr lacker  okay  well the reason i ask is that i am a little hesitant to set an upper
bound on a range without understanding what sort of mechanism we would have for making that
credible  that is why i asked about that  two more questions  one the word zerocan you
help me understand the thinking about why we should be a little averse to using that word
mr madigan  well one reason might be that if you gave some weight to the view
that very low interest rates do have costs in financial markets and you wanted to preserve some
rhetorical or substantive leeway you would want to have a somewhat positive interest rate to the
degree that you could achieve one but still a low level
mr lacker  okay  one final question  we in the late 1970s adopted a set of
guidelines regarding agency debt and modified that in the late 1990s  i dont have a copy with
me  i think the latest adoption of that was january 2003 and i believe it is permanent  i think it
is still in effect  i think it states that our purchases are not intended to channel funds to any
specific sector  i am wondering about the staffs interpretation of the consistency between our
gse debt and agencyguaranteed mbs purchases and that guidance
mr madigan  i do have that guideline here and you are correct president lacker
the first paragraph of the guideline says that system open market operations in agency issues are
an integral part of open market operations designed to influence bank reserves money market
conditions and monetary aggregates  the second paragraph says that open market operations in
those issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into
issues of particular agencies  as you remembered in my briefing yesterday i did raise the
question as to committee members views of the allocation of funds to particular firms or
sectors  it is possible that the committee may want to modify suspend or repeal this guideline
at some point
mr lacker  they do seem inconsistent though and i think it is something mr
chairman that we ought to consider
chairman bernanke  noted  i think i am somewhat at fault here  i did consult
with everyone on the committee and discussed what we were going to do  i would say that
going forward we should probably bring all such plans to the committee
mr lacker  thanks  it would be good to have that public  it is a public document
is it not  or it is not a public document yet  it is on the committee records right
mr madigan  i believe it is public
mr lacker  okay  it would be nice to have that in conformance with what we are
actually doing  thank you mr chairman  i appreciate that
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  may i ask two questions please  with regard to alternative a i am
curious brian as to how you think the bankers would respond to that in terms of their pricing
behavior and loans and prime  second our friend from the new york desk how do you think
the markets might respond to alternative anot overnight by the way which i couldnt care
less about but over the longer term
mr madigan  on the former just a guess i would think that without any target
federal funds rateand given the wellknown issues that we have been discussing about
pressures on banksit is possible that the prime rate would not be reduced by the full extent of
the implicit reduction in the money market conditions that the fomc would be targeting  but i
dont really have a good sense as to what would happen quantitatively
mr dudley  i think the market will be slightly confused but i think they will figure
it out quite quickly  they will scan the document and figure out well what does this really
mean  they will be surprised by the magnitude of the interest rate reduction  as i said
yesterday most of the dealers are clustered around a 50 basis point reduction in the target
mr fisher  even though we are not stating a specific target it would be implicit in
the change in the level of the discount rate
mr dudley  we are saying here that we are at exceptionally low levels of the funds
rate for some time  i think they will understand that this is it and that the funds rate is going to
be very very low  obviously the next day you will probably observe a federal funds rate that is
no more than a couple of basis points would be my guess
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just a followup on that  i am a little confused that we dont set a target
but we are operating under an interest on reserves scheme by which we pay a deposit rate which
in fact we just lowered  is there some kind of disconnect between what is in alternative a
paragraph 5lowering the discount rate and the interest rates on reservesand not noting a
change in the target rate when in fact we have already established that the deposit rate is going
to be the target rate  so i am confused  maybe the markets will see through this but i dont
know  i am not quite sure i understand what is going on and how this would work in terms of
communications or interpretations
mr dudley  i think the markets would look at this as saying it is a substantial rate
cut  the funds rate has been trading soft to the interest rate on excess reserves by a considerable
margin  the interest rate on excess reserves was cut considerably so they will figure out that
therefore the funds rate is going to trade at an exceptionally low level  but you are rightit will
not be quite as straightforward as putting it out there right up front
mr plosser  i guess my trouble is that the committee judged that it is not useful to
set a specific target for the funds rate and yet this will be interpreted as that we reduced the target
in effect
chairman bernanke  we can discuss this in the goround  president evans
mr evans  may i just ask bill dudley if he could describe how he anticipates his
operations would differ between alternative a and alternative b  how would you do things
differently
mr dudley  i think we wouldnt do things differently to any meaningful degree
chairman bernanke  other questions  i think it might be helpful to flag just a
few things about which i would particularly appreciate the committees advice  the first is the
issue that president plosser was discussing which is alternative anot specifying a range or a
targetor alternative bspecifying a range  i think that the argument for specifying a range is
that it seems a little clearer  if you look at for example the japanese experience even when
they were in quantitative easing they still had a target for the call rate as i understand it  there
are some counterarguments which governor duke and others have raised about the impact on
banks and so on  that is question number 1  question number 2and this doesnt preclude
other points of courseis that in paragraph 3 of alternative b for example we have bracketed
just for your reference the risk of inflations declining below optimal levels  i would be
interested to know your views on whether or not to include that bracketed phrase
thirdagain looking at alternative bin paragraph 4 we have the conditional statement
that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal
funds rate  a little informal polling suggested that people were sort of okay with this way of
stating the conditionality  but if there are any concerns about that or alternatively if you would
like to include a reference to disinflation as one of the conditions that is just something i want to
flag as a question
a fourth and final point i want to flagand president yellen pointed this out to mein
paragraph 5 we have a sentence saying that the committee is also evaluating the potential
benefits of purchasing longerterm treasury securities  i think to put that in there we should
feel that sometime in the next few meetings there is a significant chance that we would in fact
engage in some kind of a program  we dont want to put it in there if it is a complete red
herring
so those are four points that i have but of course you may have other questions or issues
that you want to raise  governor duke
ms duke  mr chairman just one response to president lackers and president
plossers observations which i think are related  if you set the rate that we are going to pay for
interest on reserves the same as the target rate for fed funds and the market does repair itself and
resume then you would expect there to be some risk spread over the rate that we are paying on
interest on reserves  so if we dont set a target or we set the target something higher than the
rate that we are paying at least if the markets do start to resume then the desk isnt in a position
of then having to try to drive the rate back down again
chairman bernanke  thank you  all right  lets begin the goround  well
begin with president rosengren
mr rosengren  the bleak outlook calls for aggressive action  with the effective
federal funds rate already well below our target there is a logic to moving to the floor at this
meeting and redirecting attention to nontraditional policies  thus i am comfortable with
alternative b and would reduce the interest rates on required and excess reserves to 25 basis
points
in terms of the questions that the chairman just posed i am comfortable specifying the
range of 0 to  percent  i would actually keep the bracketed information  i am okay with the
conditionality  i would remove the reference to the treasury securities and for the future i
would certainly want to think about expanding the purchase of gse and agency mortgage
backed securities beyond 600 billion  also i would support at a future date setting a target of
2 percent for the core pce inflation rate
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative a so let me just talk
for a few minutes about what i like about it  i like the language not useful to set a specific
target for the federal funds rate in alternative a because i think this will begin the process of
getting the private sector to think in alternative terms about monetary policy  that would be
similar to the moves made during the 197982 period  let me just stress that i think the whole
process is going to be very difficult  we have an entire generation of privatesector financial
market participants who are conditioned to think only in terms of a federal funds rate target as
the whole definition of what monetary policy is  i might remind the committeeif it needs
reminding and it probably doesntthat it is a big country out there  when you start talking to
others outside the particular participants in financial markets the level of understanding of
monetary policy is very limited  the subtleties get lost and so it is going to take a lot of time
and effort to convince everyone and to explain to everyone that we are switching to new policies
i expect in fact that it will probably be a threeyear period that will be marked by controversy
over headlines that are of the form what is the fed doingmuch like the 197982 period
when there was continuing controversy and continuing efforts to explain
i also like the paragraph that places emphasis on alternative policies  i would keep the
bracketed information  i thought the conditionality was okay  i will say about the alternative
policies those policies have unknown impact and so we dont want to be too detailed here
because they may have to evolve in the future  i would take out the part about the longerterm
treasury securities
i would put in the inflation target  i said before that i think it is an important point to be
able to reassure and anchor expectations in this very fluid situation which may rapidly unravel
on us  this is a good opportunity to do this and i would go ahead with that  i dont think it is
that different from our longerterm projections but it is much more direct and communicates
much more clearly to markets that we have a mediumterm inflation target
on the question of what should be in the directive i will say this  i see it as somewhat
dangerous for this committee and for the nation to say nothing about the level of reserves or the
monetary base  it is true that it may not be inflationary now or in normal times and it may not
have been inflationary in japan  but there are many examples around the world where money
supplies got out of control and inflation was a very serious problem  it could be explosive in
some parts of the world especially if there were a large loss of confidence in the us
government or in the performance of this committee  so i think we want to reassure the world
that we are carefully monitoring that situation that we have our eye on it  as several people
have commented around here a common refrain among business leaders we talk to is what the
hell is going on  you know your balance sheet is way up  isnt that going to be inflationary
and we are saying no but i think we need to give continual reassurance that we are
monitoring that situation we have it under control and we are thinking about it  i also think as
president stern said yesterday that it would help signal our intention to keep inflation near
target other than simply promising to do so which is just pure reliance on our credibility  you
have something quantitative that you can point to  obviously it has to be done in a sensible way
that allows us to bring in other programs and expand the balance sheet in other ways  i think it is
just a matter of making a statement that we are keeping our eye on the whole situation
as far as the other alternatives let me disparage them for a minute  laughter  i dont
knowwe havent gone all around the table herebut i dont want to be naming targets that we
dont intend to hit  so i dont want to say that we have a target but we are not actually going to
do it  if we are going to do that then we have to change the language somehow that whatever
the number that we are naming is not really a target  okay  i would be very averse to doing
anything like that
in alternative b the first sentence states a target range for the federal funds rate  my
feeling about this is that effectively in the big picture no one will read past that first sentence
they will just say oh yes the fed lowered interest rates  the idea that we are switching to
some new regime or that markets have to start thinking in alternative ways about monetary
policy is going to be lost  if you wanted to put a more aggressive spin on this this is the do
nothing option  the effective federal funds rate is near zero anyway so this is just saying
well this is business as usual  we are going to sit on our hands  we are constrained by the
zero bound and we are not going to really change anything  so i see it as important to get the
markets off this and i see alternative a as one way to do that  but maybe you all will convince
me otherwise  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  given the dismal state of the economy and
with the funds rate averaging around 18 percent anyway i dont see any reason to wait to bring
the fed funds rate down to effectively zero  i agree with the staff analysis that any dislocation of
the money funds is likely to be minor  my board put in for a 75 basis point cut in the discount
rate  when i looked over at my small bankers i was afraid one of them was going to throw a
shoe at me  laughter  i escaped that
chairman bernanke  that is going around  laughter
mr lacker  so i support alternative a  i think it makes sense to deemphasize the
funds rate target  for reasons that were illuminated by brian earlier and reasons that governor
duke alluded to as well i dont think a target range is useful  we dont want to discourage hope
among our community bankers that we might get above  percent should conditions normalize
to some degree  we do set an interest rate on excess reserve balances or more precisely the
committees reduction in the federal funds rate target reduces the rate on excess reserves given
the boards adopted formula for setting the excess reserves rate  we have a similar sort of
governance disconnect between the discount rate approval decisions of the board of governors
and the federal funds rate decisions taken by the federal open market committee  we have
managed to coordinate those very effectively with cohesion and with consensus  it seems to me
to make sense to take the same approach to the excess reserves rate
i like the language in alternative a paragraph 3 where we abandon the target and
indicate that the funds rate is likely to be near zero for a while  the conditionality the way it is
expressed there or in b4 is fine with me  i like the idea of shifting attention to the interest rate
on reserves by including the statement in the related actions sentence of a5 that further cements
the governance coordination that we have in mind there
i think it makes eminent sense to be very explicit very soon about our numerical
objective for inflation  monetary policy at the zero bound is all about discouraging expectations
of deflation  if we havent tried first announcing an explicit objective for inflation we dont
have any excuses if we fail to prevent a fall into a deflationary equilibrium  but i am
sympathetic to the notion that it might not be best to slip it in the statement in the dead of night
without any fanfare  it might encourage the view that it is a temporary expedient and that we
might abandon this language in some future statement should we find it convenient  i think it
would be better to do this and issue a separate statement very clearly articulating that the
committee has adopted a numerical inflation objective here is what it means here is how we
interpret it and here is why we do it  perhaps january would be the right time to do that and we
could between now and then lay the groundwork for a clearer and more forceful
communication  i think it is likely to have a bigger effect on financial market participants and
the public should we do so  without that statement about an objective the sentence that
precedes itspecifically the phrase that is in brackets in a2is a little scary  so i would prefer
to leave that bracketed thing out if we are not going to include the inflation objective
the fourth paragraph in alternative a and the corresponding paragraphs in b and c
discuss how we are going to conduct monetary policy while the funds rate is at zero  i think they
are intended to signal a shift toward quantitative measures but i found the language ambiguous
and confusing  none says anything about the monetary base  none says anything about the size
of our balance sheet  in other words they dont indicate that the credit programs wouldnt be
sterilized  i think the phrase use our balance sheet is ambiguous  it doesnt necessarily mean
expand the size it could mean put some stuff on it  so i would like to see us find a way to
improve the clarity of the language in paragraph 4 regarding the quantitative measures that i
think it is intended to communicate
that paragraph also mentions two programs  the agency debt purchases which we talked
about earlierlet me set that asideand the talf which the committee has not been asked to
formally consider and approve  now i can appreciate the strict constructionist governance view
of who gets to approve them it is not important that we vote on them  but i have been thinking
about this in terms of the idealthe vision you portrayed and described for us yesterday of a
cohesive consensusbuilding decisionmaking process  i compared the talf and what the
committee has heard about it  contrast that with the deliberations we gave to the extension of
foreign exchange swap lines to emergingmarket countries  there were fairly extensive briefing
memorandums provided to the committee and there was a fairly lengthy discussion of that step
in contrast we were basically informed about the talf rather than consulted in any meaningful
sense
part of the problem here is that this paragraph conflates the use of our balance sheet with
expansions of the base and these are two distinct policy actions  in the current circumstance
unsterilized lending does increase the base  but we have been doing these programs since before
that was true and the distinction doesnt come through clearly in the language here  there is a
tension here because a couple of different plausible theories are floating around about how this
stuff affects the economy and our objectives and how things are going to work at the zero bound
i am not sure that we are going to settle on a single theory  in fact i am sure that we are not
going to settle on a single theory  but we should strive in the interest of consensus for a
statement that encompasses a range of plausible views  we have done that in the past in
finessing things like different views of the phillips curve and the like and i would urge us to try
to do that here rather than take a monolithic approach
finally let me say something about the directive  the new drafts of a b and c add a
sentence the operative words of which are keep the committee informed and it is that the
secretary and the system open market account manager would keep the committee informed
this is somewhat short of the language you used yesterday which admittedly might not be
appropriate for the directive  but i wrote the language down and it is that the board would bring
programs to the fomc for review and discussion  i like the sentence that is added in the sense
that it is a step in the right direction toward your vision of a collaborative body seeking
consensus on these issues  but i am afraid that this language wont do much to dispel questions
that have arisen in the press about our governance cohesion and decisionmaking  so i personally
would prefer to go as far as we could in that direction  thank you very much mr chairman
chairman bernanke  jeff i just want to make a couple of comments  a very
small one is that in an early draft instead of saying entail the use of the federal reserves
balance sheet we had entail increasing the size of the federal reserves balance sheet  we
thought that might not be appropriate because things go on and off
mr lacker  other things pull it down
chairman bernanke  right  we were probably going to do that as a trend
maybe not day to day but it has some of the flavor of increasing the base  so that is one just
observation  on the talf we have added a presentation today from bill dudley and pat
parkinson
mr lacker  excellent  thank you
chairman bernanke  finally on the directive there is a bit of a difference which
is that i do think we need to bring new programs et cetera for your information as i said before
but this is actually a stronger statement in that it also means that we should report to you on the
ongoing implications of existing programs for the base and for the balance sheet  so there is a
bit of a difference in those two concepts
mr lacker  thank you  mr chairman i do like the increase statement and i
think we could easily explain that we are looking at a partial differential effect
chairman bernanke  all right  one possibility is entail increasing the size
there is some risk there but i think that would be the general trend that we are considering
others can comment
mr dudley  i think the real issue is what happens to the cpff what happens to the
swap programs and the takeup of the taf  those are the three big elements and they
conceivably could run down in the first quarter
chairman bernanke  you could say increasing over time the size or something
like that
mr dudley  or likely to
chairman bernanke  yes  that was the reason we switched
mr lacker  the statement doesnt have to stand for the whole first quarter does it
mr dudley  no  but i think the issue is that because we have open facilities we
just cant guarantee what their takeup is going to be relative to what they are today  the swap
lines are roughly 600 billion those could come down
mr lacker  well each facility makes the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise
would be
mr rosengren  a lot of these could go down quite substantially if conditions
improve and we wouldnt control that
chairman bernanke  right  that was the concern we hadthat it wouldnt
necessarily be a monotonic increase that it could have ups and downs depending on usage and
so on
mr lacker  well i have in mind here the confusion that some around this table have
reported hearing from the public about what we are doing with our balance sheet  i think
acknowledging that it is expanding in size would be an important feature
chairman bernanke  all right  well we can hear from others about that as well
president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i certainly agree that more accommodation is
needed  we need to take actions to provide as best we can the quantitative easing equivalent of
the optimal control path as discussed in the briefing  i am not sure ultimately how feasible that
will be but it is a good goal for us over the next few months
now in terms of the differences between alternative a and alternative b as i understood
bill dudley there is no operational difference in these two options  it really comes down to how
we want to communicate with ourselves and also the public  i tend to favor alternative b
certainly for now and maybe alternative a later  after all if the funds rate is going to go to zero
in reality then alternative a might be the right language  but we will have time to see that  this
is a reasonable sequencing  the action today that we are dropping the funds rate target range
75 to 100 basis points is big and certainly that will be the first thing that they see in the first line
i think they will continue reading  the language on the conditionality about the funds rate being
exceptionally low is certainly okay today  the language says the committee anticipates that
weak economic conditions are likely to warrant  i guess there is some question as to whether or
not we should include the dual mandate herethat disinflationary forces are also part of that  i
could go with the consensus there but i would just raise that as a question
regarding the bracketed risk that inflation could decline for a time below optimal rates
the rates that we think are bestback in 2003 this is what got a tremendous amount of attention
that is another reason that as people read further it could have a very large effect  it seems to
be accurate  one way to deal with that would be to allow the minutes to capture that discussion
at least this time and perhaps to put it in next time  it depends on the accumulation of how many
of these large noteworthy developments we want in the statement here  i would be even more
comfortable if that type of statement were accompanied by a context such as that we would be
seeking conditions of inflation being around 2 percent  i realize that this may not be the ideal
time to include that without a more extended discussion  but i would be okay with the bracketed
information if that is the consensus
i think we should probably omit the treasury purchases if we dont think that we are
going to do that by march  certainly omitting it today is low cost  given all the information it
is probably overload
i am okay with the language in the directive  accompanying the language is all of the
discussion about the collaboration that we have between the board and the committee generally
and so i have a very good feeling about that  i think that it will tend to evolve as this goes on
whether or not it is maximum thresholds or just changing the composition of all of this  so those
are my preferences  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like the others who have spoken before me i
think this situation is very serious  we need to do all we can and i think we need to recognize
the reality of where we are  so either alternative a or alternative b does that to a significant
extent  i guess i have a slight preference for alternative a as a better recognition that we are not
really controlling the federal funds rate in here  we have these other balance sheet things going
on and to me alternative b has a little of the flavor of drawing your target around the hole we
have already made in the barn door or whatever and pretending that you have some control that
you dont really have  so i think a is better  president bullard made a very good point that a
tends to refocus attention on these alternative policies that we all agree will be the focus of our
attention going forward  but i could live with either a or b
in terms of some of the issues you raisedso going down alternative ain paragraph 2
the bracketed language here i agree with president lacker  i think my slight preference would
be to wait until january to do this  whether or not we have an explicit inflation target as we
come out of the january meeting we can debate in january  we will i hope have at least these
longrun projections and this bracketed language can be explained in terms of those longrun
projections  right now it kind of sits out there  we havent yet explained what we think the
rates are that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term  by the end of
the january meeting we can do that  so i think i would wait for that
i think the conditional language in the third paragraph is helpful and i would favor
keeping it in  it is appropriately conditioned on weak economic conditions  if other people
wanted to add the disinflationary forces which i think come primarily from the weak
economic conditions that would be okay with me too  but i am fine with this
in the first sentence of paragraph 4this is a small pointi would take out the to
continue  the focus of policy going forward will be to support the functioning     when i
first read the to continue it sounded as though we are just going to continue what we are doing
now  so i would take that out but that is a small point  on the discussion about whether we
should put the size in i am a little worried about putting it in because the balance sheet has
grown so rapidly  if it came down because yearend pressures abated and because the swaps
with all of those foreign central banks might tend to come down after the end of the year i dont
think that the committee would necessarily want bill to be replacing every dollar of eurodollar
swaps that came down with something else  i think we are talking about a longrun trend in the
base and we need to be careful about not trying to leave the impression that in every
intermeeting period we would expect the base to increase especially when we dont control that
size  so i would be a little cautious about that  certainly if we did include increase the size of
the balance sheet i also would say something about the composition  in my view it is actually
the composition more than the size that is going to influence relative asset prices even though i
do recognize that over very long periods if we keep the base from declining it would be hard to
have prices decline  but i am not sure that is really an effective way to deal with expectations in
the short or intermediate run
i would include the purchases of longerterm treasury securities  among other things i
think we ought to do it sometime in the next few months  the fact that you have already talked
about it if we omit iti guess i disagree with president evans herei dont think that will be
low cost  we have a series of things we are doing and that is not part of it  i think there could
be an adverse market reaction  going back to the base for a second i agree that we need to do a
better job of explaining as i said yesterday what this new framework is how the increase in
reserves and the base fits into itif we can come to some conclusion on thatand why under
these circumstances a very large increase in the base isnt inflationary and how that comes about
we need to do a much better job of explaining these kinds of things  but again i would be
hesitant to put an explicit target in terms of the level of reserves or the base in there because i
dont really understand the channels through which they influence prices or activity in the short
and intermediate terms
finally on bank profits and the effects there ordinarily i wouldnt worry about bank
profits  it is just a transfer between the owners of banks and households and businesses and
quite frankly transferring some income to households and businesses seems like a pretty good
idea most of the time in these circumstances  i agree that it is more ambiguous than usual given
the worries about the financial sector  still we are doing a lot for the banks  we are giving
them capital  we are guaranteeing their liabilitieswe the government that is  this will
reduce the rates at which they borrow from the discount window and from each other so they are
getting something there  i think banks are going to need to figure out how to operate at these
really low interest rates so i wouldnt let my concern about bank profits stop me from doing
either alternative a or alternative b  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr lacker  just a thought in response to governor kohns comments  would the
phrase add to do a better job than increase the size of in conveying the sense that these
programs are going to make the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise would be rather than lead
to an absolute increase in the size of the balance sheet
mr kohn  i am not sure those words help me actually  add to sounds the same as
increase to me  i have missed the subtlety here
mr lacker  other things held constant
mr kohn  ceteris paribus  we could put that in there
chairman bernanke  it is already greek anyway  laughter  president
lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  my preference is to move in this meeting
to the consensus lowerbound range for the funds target and i prefer the range of 0 to 25  so i
believe either alternative a or alternative b will work as serviceable options and i can live with
either one  but i actually lean toward alternative b  i think it is the clearest and with the
inclusion of the language related to deflation it is also internally more consistent  in particular
my preference is to indicate that the fomc intends to keep the policy rate low until economic
and credit conditions improve and i think it is appropriate to emphasize that our policies will be
calibrated based on longerterm inflation objectives
as i said yesterday i am thinking that the conditionality language could be stronger
specifically i have in mind something along the lines of a statement that reads that the
committee intends to maintain this range for the federal funds rate until such time that it judges
conditions are present for material and sustained improvements in financial market functioning
and economic growth and the committee believes that this policy course is consistent with its
mediumterm price stability objective  i think that kind of language could fit at the beginning
of paragraph 4 around that area in alternative b  i think that is stronger than the implicit
conditionality that is already in the statement  in my rounds of contacts before the meeting one
conversation did resonate with me  it was a call from a financial market participant for hearing
what the plan is and what the strategy is and affirming that there is a plan  i think stronger
conditionality language would respond to that need in the marketplace
as regards the questions i think i have already covered some of them  i would prefer the
specifying of a range in alternative b  i would lean toward including the language and sees
some risk that inflation could decline because it ties in with the all available tools language at
the beginning of paragraph 4  in other words i think if we include that language in paragraph 3
we are setting up a risk and the employ all available tools responds strongly to that risk
regarding the inclusion of the longterm treasury securities i am persuaded by
governor kohns comment that we should include it  it is consistent with whatever public
discussion we have had to date including your speech of two weeks ago  so that is all  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i think at the end of the day alternatives a
and b really amount to the same thing in terms of policy  so i could live with either but on
communication grounds my own strong preference would be for b  i think it is important at this
juncture for the fomc to state very clearly what it wants the federal funds rate to be that we
want it to remain close to zero and i think we best do that by specifying explicitly a rate or as it
is a range  both a and b eliminate the gap we have had between the target and the reality of
where the funds rate is actually trading but b eliminates that gap by embracing the current
reality as desirable
in contrast it seems to me that a is saying that the committee is all but helpless to affect
the funds rate so after all it would be a charade to set a target  then it kind of acknowledges
well but you know the funds rate trading near zero is really not such a bad thing given the
weakness in the economy  i think we have greater command over the funds rates destiny than
alternative a suggests  if the board and the fomc really wanted to push the effective funds rate
up above zero say to 50 or to 100 basis points the board could choose to raise the rates paid on
reserves and the discount rate and we could get it up even though we have all of this enormous
quantity of excess reserves and even though interest on reserves isnt working in quite the way
we expected  i agree that it would be a bit odd to be setting the interest on reserves and discount
rates above our target for the federal funds rate  but it seems to me it could be done and we are
not powerless to accomplish it  so i dont like the suggestion that we are just helpless to move
the funds rate  i think we should say that we dont want to move the funds rate up  i dont want
it to trade above the 0 to 25 basis point errange  i certainly dont want that  i think the forecast
is grim  i think we should go as low as we can as fast as we can without harming the functioning
of money markets so keeping the funds rate trading in the 0 to 25 range is desirable  if it were
to be the case following president lackers earlier question that we suddenly saw the interest on
reserves floor working better and fed funds started trading above 25the funds rate could for
example move up to 50 or soi would hope that the board would actually lower the interest
rate paid on reserves to hold the funds rate in the 0 to 25 range  so i think we should go down
and do it decisively in one step today
on the other matters in alternative b paragraph 3 i favor including the bracketed
language suggesting that we expect and are not happy to see inflation declining below levels we
consider consistent with price stability  i agree with president evans on the merits of doing that
i like the forwardlooking language from a that has been added in bold to b concerning the odds
that we will keep the funds rate low for some time  on the treasuries i am worried about
making an announcement or giving a hint that we are not going to follow through on them pretty
quickly  i am personally in favor of and support buying longerterm treasuries and i havent
heard a lot of opposition to it  if we really are going to do it and do it pretty soon i have no
problem with including language to that effect  but i dont think we should throw a hint out
there unless we intend to follow through  with respect to the wording of the directive i am
happy with it  with respect to the issue about the monetary base and increasing the size of our
balance sheet i would endorse governor kohns remarks on that topic
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  if we were still working with the framework of
targeting the fed funds rate i would prefer d and i would accept c and i would vote accordingly
but i think what ive heard in the past two days is that we have really abandoned that framework
and this is kind of a ratification of that  i think that our framework now is actually in a and b in the
statement that we are going to expand its purchases    as conditions warrant  if thats the case
then going with a in which you dont set a fed funds rate or talk about it is probably preferred
i also think that were now in a credit policy type of framework and it bothers me  i have a
lot of sympathy for what presidents lacker and bullard said  i would prefer rather than a statement
that says as conditions warrant that we have some kind of a monetary base criterion for the
future  this is something that we ought to think about  at the same time i do not think that we
should have inflation below optimal in this statement  i dont think were there and at this point i
think it should not be hinted at
i think that purchasing longerterm treasury securities goes with the conditionality
statement anyway  well do what it takes and if it takes purchasing longerterm treasuries thats
it  that is what we have unless we go back and look at a new framework that we need to get out
and talk about with the public and i hope that as our meetings and our discussions progress we
begin to focus on that  thank you
chairman bernanke  again as i said yesterday this is a work in progress
mr hoenig  i agree
chairman bernanke  well keep working on it  i didnt quite get your proposal
do you propose leaving in the sentence about treasuries at this meeting
mr hoenig  if were going to have statements that say were going to purchase
mortgagebacked securities as conditions warrant i dont think purchasing longerterm treasury
securities is a much different step from that so we can leave it in
chairman bernanke  okay  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  obviously for us to counteract the powerful
forces that are weakening our economy and financial markets we should provide maximum
monetary policy stimulus as quickly as possible and conducting monetary policy on the basis of a
fed funds rate target is no longer the best strategy  i do think it is time and it would be helpful to
begin focusing the publics attention on the unconventional approach to monetary policy and i
think alternative a does a better job of doing that
what i like about alternative a is its straightforward characterization of the policy situation
and how we plan to respond to it  i support leaving in the language that is bracketed in alternative
a paragraph 2 about the risk that inflation could decline for some time below rates that best foster
economic growth and price stability  the reason i say that is that we have been using the language
that the committee expects inflation to moderate for some time now and given the discussion i
think we expect that situation to be getting worse  so i would support leaving that in  i would also
leave in paragraph 3 the more forwardlooking language about keeping the low level of the fed
funds rate for some time  i also would keep in the language on the potential benefits of purchasing
longerterm treasury securities  i assume that the minutes that are released in three weeks are going
to say that we discussed it and that we will be evaluating it  so i would just leave it in  also given
the dire economic outlook that we are talking about and the aggressive response that we think
monetary policy should take i think just saying merely that we stand ready to expand the purchase
of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities isnt aggressive enough  i do realize that there are a
lot of important questions that are left unanswered such as determining the mix of assets to
purchase and how to know when enough is enough and then how to shrink our balance sheet when
the time comes  but i do think that adopting alternative a is taking a big step in the direction of
giving the public some indication of what we plan to do
finally i know you just said that we will come up with some language and some framework
around what we are doing  but as discussed in yesterdays conversation having some talking
points even in the near term so that we are consistent in our language on what we are doing would
be helpful  at a time when there is a lot of confusion out there and markets are as fragile as they
are having us all talk about this in the same way would be helpful  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well as several people have observedand i
agreei dont think theres any significant policy difference between a and b  thats certainly
where i am  from a communication point of view i have a mild preference for b  i think its a
little clearer on the margin and would be helpful in that regard  so i would work off b as to some of
the issues and suggestions that have been raised
with regard to the first issue i would not include the information in brackets in paragraph 3
at this point  i think governor kohn made a good point that were likely to be much better
positioned to do that in january in conjunction with the sep and the longerterm projections  let
me be clear  i am in favor of inflation targeting but i think exactly how and when we get to that is
important  so i wouldnt want to do that simply in a casual way and do it too rapidly
as i look at paragraph 3 i have a couple of other questions  the first sentence says that
inflationary pressures have diminished quickly which is certainly true but i think it may be more
important that they have diminished appreciably  so i would just make that point  i might also say
rather than the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters which i think is
probably true that you might just say the committee expects modest inflation in coming quarters
the reason im putting it that way is that im trying to get out of this point precisely about whether
it is or isnt going to run below what we think might be consistent with the dual objectives
i think the conditionality in paragraph 4 is fine  if theres a good way to strengthen it doing
so would also be fine with me  but trying to modify these things on the fly is always difficult
finally i would include the thought about purchasing longerterm treasuries  i think we should
and because i think we should i think we should say that  so i guess that covers the topics i want to
cover
chairman bernanke  thank you  maybe i should ask bill  do you see any purely
operational issues in the next few months if we decide to purchase longerterm treasuries
mr dudley  we can do it but were under a strain  as long as we dont start until
sometime in january i think we could manage as long as you dont ask us to do it every day
chairman bernanke  we wont
mr kroszner  every other day
mr dudley  how about once every couple of weeks
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  these are indeed troubling times and i think
in troubling times its even more important that we be as transparent and clear as possible  i think
its time that we publicly convey that we have entered a new monetary policy regime  to do
otherwise perpetuates the view that we are no longer in control of monetary policy rather than that
we have opted to implement policy through a different means particularly our balance sheet
theres ample room for judgment here and disagreement but mr chairman with all due
respect im deeply troubled by elements of the steps that we are taking today  in effect i interpret
our proposed actions as substituting creditallocation policies for monetary policies  both the
expansion of our balance sheet and the fed funds rate are now determined or will be now
determined by decisions about which markets or firms are deemed worthy of our intervention and
support and some assessment of how much money we want to throw at them  i think we all agree
that we are looking for the best policies  i think that its also true that best policies are based on
clearly articulated goals and objectives and in credible and systematic actions to achieve those goals
and objectives and they can also be credibly communicated to the public  i feel that our approach
to credit policy comes up lacking in each of these dimensions  our goal may be to prevent systemic
risk but we havent clearly defined what that is or the criteria that were using to decide whom to
lend to and when to lend to them  its very important for both clarity and transparency that we
rectify this deficiency or we may continue to create moral hazard and to see market after market
after market seek our help
the message from the literature we discussed yesterday is that near the zero bound our
credibility and our commitment to generate inflation and prevent expectations of deflation to
develop are paramount  my reading of the proposed language is that it does little to signal that
commitment  indeed it seems to suggest that our primary objectives are and will continue to be
credit interventions  confusing our monetary policy objectives with our credit policies is not the
kind of message that im comfortable with  i think we need to be careful not to convey to the
market that monetary policy has become ineffective and i dont think anyone at this table wishes to
do that
president lacker articulated the importance in the current environment of keeping inflation
expectations well anchored and measures of the baseor if you would rather look at the asset side
of the balance sheet either way theyre both measuring the balance sheetare a means of
anchoring those expectations  i dont think the language of the directive or the statement is clear
enough in addressing either the effectiveness of monetary policy or the credible commitment to
avoid deflation or even to maintain inflation near our target which is clearly not deflation  im not
quite as fearful of deflation as president bullard or some others but i think we need to be mindful
and reinforce our commitment to low but stable inflation
on the governance side i continue to believe that the fomc is the appropriate body for
making monetary policy decisions and that replacing monetary policy with credit policies that are
unconstrained by this committee is to violate both good governance and the spirit of the operating
understanding of the fomc  yesterday and in my memo to the committee earlier this week i
argued that the directive and the statement should clearly state that we are in a new regime and
should articulate how that new regime will operate going forward  my interpretation is that the
proposed language particularly alternative a does help indicate that we are moving to a new
regime  thats important and therefore i lean in that direction  but that language fails to articulate
how that new regime will operate except to say that the board of governors will continue credit
market interventions  it says nothing about the terms and strategies that well employ to do so  the
implicit message isand i think the market will clearly interpret it this waythat the fomc has
ceded monetary policy decisions to the board of governors and i think that will be damaging
such a step in my view is not good policy nor is it good governance and it may have political
ramifications as well  once the committee sets the precedent that the board of governors can
assume sole responsibility for monetary policy we run the risk of losing the strength and the
diversity of views that the system has always brought
my sense is that this committees setting some kind of cap on the size of the balance sheet
was an effort to clarify the role of monetary policy in contrast to credit policy  i think the reaction i
heard yesterday around the table was a litany of reasons why setting base growth targets is not
appropriate  while that might be an interesting debate to have that was not the point i was
proposing  i was requesting that we have a debt ceiling if you will and that the fomc would
review and adjust that debt ceiling as it deemed appropriatenot targets for balance sheets per se
such a debt ceiling would not prevent the board of governors from managing the asset side of the
balance sheet via 133 lending  only when unsterilized lending exceeded the debt ceiling might
formal approval be required from the fomc  mr chairman my discomfort is not a matter simply
of good governance  it is more fundamentally about the lack of clarity discipline and transparency
that the strategy is offering and i have deep concerns
id like to offer a couple of suggestions for the committee to consider about language and
im working off alternative a which i think is probably the working hypothesis here  so to answer
your questions mr chairman i have been and continue to be in favor of an explicit inflation target
most of you are aware of that  i am sympathetic to the view as i think president lacker said that
slipping it in in the dead of night is probably not the right way to go about it  i would add that i do
not like the bracketed phrase regarding the committees seeing some risk of inflation coming in too
low  as president lacker suggested it might cause fear in the marketplace  but i do think we
could change the second bracketed statement which was struck out  in support of its dual
mandate the committee will seek    a rate of inflation    of about 2 percent  i think we could
change that and heighten the importance of inflation to us and our dual mandate by saying
something to the effect of in support of its dual mandate the committee will seek a low and stable
inflation rate over the intermediate term  that would be short of specifying an inflation target but
would reinforce the notion that we are still committed to achieving a low but stable inflation rate
my biggest problem is with paragraph 4 which i think could be simplified greatly  i would
like to emphasize that monetary policy remains in the purview of the fomc and that we have
entered a new regime  so i would propose just for the sake of getting it on the table that
paragraph 4 be simplified to say that the focus of the fomcs monetary policy going forward will
be to continue to support the dual mandate and the functioning of a financial market to stimulate the
economy through open market operations and other measures that entail the use of the federal
reserves balance sheet  then i would say today the fomc affirms the expansion of the feds
balance sheet up to 3 trillion and will periodically review and adjust that in the pursuit of our dual
mandate  repeating the litany of creditmarket interventions that we have engaged in seems just
repeating what weve already done  im not sure that serves much purpose in the context of
monetary policy making at this point  im not opposed to buying gses  im not opposed to buying
longerterm treasuries  i think we need to modify brian madigans statement about the conditions
under which we should purchase gses so that we are being internally consistent but i dont have
any objection to it
so i think we could be clearer  we could be less confusing in our policies by emphasizing
again our commitment to keep inflation stable and at a positive level and clearly indicating that
quantities do matter and that this committee is responsible for those quantities and will interact with
the board of governors and our credit policies to see that we can achieve the goals that we all
decide on  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman before i get started i do think that president plosser has
raised good issues on the governance matter  i hope that we will continue to discuss this bearing in
mind that there may be changes in the composition of the governors with a new president and given
the faith that we built up with the existing governors so that we have to get at least our lines of
understanding clear as we go through time  as to the alternatives that we face the problem with the
economy isnt the interbank lending rate or even the riskless rate  the problem with the economy
and with the financial markets is that intermediation has broken down  i think our actions should
forcefully be directed toward the clearing of blockages in the financial plumbing and not just
fiddling with the faucet  its the availability and distribution of credit that is problematic
in that sense i like alternative a  in fact president stern i like its ambiguity and ill tell
you why  i am quite worried that stating zero to 25 basis points will bring down upon us the wrath
of bankers  i do think its important that community banks be profitable and that they be healthy
first vice president cumming pointed this out in her comments and to me this alternative gives us
substantial wiggle room as it were in its ambiguity  vice chairman kohn pointed out that
paragraph 5 is good for the bankers  without stating a specific target fed funds rate it allows them
to price their loans according to how they see fit  that appears to be taking place anyway  there is
a separation between the fed funds rate and the prime loan rate  so unless im missing something
bankers should positively interpret both paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 in terms of their operating
leeway
i would suggest that this is an important step forward in making clear the way were going
to operate henceforth  it does indicate a regime change and as president bullard pointed out i
think we have to be forceful in doing so  i could diddle with the language but to be even more
forceful i would transpose paragraph 4 and paragraph 3  that is the first two paragraphs strike me
as fine  at this juncture i would not put in an inflation target because i dont think were prepared
for it as a committee  im comfortable leaving in paragraph 2 that we see some risk that inflation
could decline below optimal rates for a time  after all we just got the number that makes that very
clearminus 17 on the headline rate  but then i would go immediately into what our focus is
going to be  i rather like president plossers one edit to make clear that its the focus of the
fomcs policy  after we have laid that clearand if indeed just parenthetically we are going to
make some treasury purchases we should include that in there if we are not we should notthen
in what would be paragraph 4 strike in current circumstances and say that the committee judged
that it was not useful to set a specific target for the fed funds rate  youre making it very clear that
we have a regime change  as to the content of paragraph 4 assuming we are going to be
purchasing longerterm treasuries id leave it as it is  stay on message  repeat it over and over
and over again  you started with your speech in austin and that makes it operative  i have no
problem with it and i would urge it be included as written
so my suggestions in summary are that we embrace alternative a we transpose paragraphs
4 and 3 we take out the wording in current circumstances because obviously were judging things
in current circumstances and we not include an inflation target at this juncture but do include the
rest of the bracketed language in paragraph 2  i believe this is sellable to our bankers and i believe
its a good way to proceed  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president cumming
ms cumming  yes thank you  like others i see the circumstances as requiring the
most action we can take  therefore i would favor alternative a somewhat over alternative b but i
could live with either  i think that alternative a has the advantage which president bullard
described and others have referred to that it does signal a significant change in what were doing
and draws attention to it  if anything it probably provokes more dialogue with us as a central bank
which i think at this point is a good thing
turning to the next paragraph im a bit concerned that inflation is in fact moderating very
quickly  this mornings number for the total cpi is 11 percent  that would lead me to ask
whether we are expecting inflation to moderate or are in fact seeing inflation moderating  this
point is similar to president sterns  that would also lead me to leave in the bracketed point about
the future and the concern there because i think its better if we put it on the table than have people
say dont they see that as a problem  to that end i also want to endorse the kind of broad
strategy statement that president lockhart put forward  i actually came into the meeting with a very
similar sentence from my staff really talking about what our goal is  i think it does help to set the
stage for what follows here and this was a focus on improving conditions in financial markets or
financial intermediation and ensuring a recovery in output and maintaining low inflation
chairman bernanke  im sorry  what was the beginning
ms cumming  i think that president lockhart was proposing that it follow paragraph 2
perhaps in its own paragraph  we would raise the question of the risk of too low inflation but then
have the next paragraph really speak to what our goals would be and i thought the sentence that you
had sounded good
mr lockhart  i can confuse the matter by saying that i was thinking of it in alternative
b and ms cumming has it in alternative a  so somewhere in there
ms cumming  then continuing with this i would comment on the next paragraph  im
very sympathetic to the idea that president lacker was putting forwardthat we somehow need to
talk about our expectations about the size of the balance sheet  i was going to offer one suggestion
perhaps for the entail the use of phrase in the first sentence of paragraph 4 we could substitute
sustain the size of the federal reserves balance sheet at very high levelssomething that would
indicate that we expect the balance sheet to remain really large but doesnt talk about whether were
increasing it from today  just a thought  i would leave in the sentence on the longerterm
treasuries in large part because we have already talked about it publicly and the language here gives
us the opportunity to evaluate and does not necessarily commit us to those purchases in the future
in any case we would need to explain whether or not were going to purchase longerterm
treasuries having raised it already
on the directive i would say that i am comfortable with the directives as written  there
might be room if we found the right language for the size of the balance sheet for inserting that
sentence in here for example whatever we take from the first sentence of paragraph 4  i also think
that as part of this monitoring that the system open market account manager and the secretary
will provide for the committee there really is the opportunity to develop much better disclosure of
what the committee is doing what our balance sheet looks like and what actions were taking
some kind of ongoing monitoring that could be shared with the public that i think would also be
very helpful in explaining what the federal reserve is actually pursuing in the near term and what it
is doing with the balance sheet
i was really impressed by something that president lacker said yesterday which is that
and i paraphrasewe are in uncharted waters but we are groping our way forward  i think that it is
a great metaphor for where in fact we are  some of these questionssuch as what specific
forwardleaning language wed like to put in our statement over time and how we think about the
monetary base versus the credit policy type of actions that were takingare all things that i think
we will continue to learn about and explore  what i had put forward is that as we come to
understand them better we have an opportunity to communicate with the public and help them
understand better what we are in fact doing  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  as others have said the choice among these
alternatives particularly a b and c is not really a choice about the effective rate  its a choice
about our clarity our conviction and maybe most important our readiness in announcing a new
regime  as i described yesterday i think the zero lower bound is not zero and so there are risks
particularly in these markets of going there or threatening to go there  so the balance of my
suggestions and edits come from the zero phobia  laughter
first let me talk about c briefly  alternative c is a sort of way station  it is our last chance
to describe the old regime and to pivot to a new regime whether the new targeted rate was 25 or 50
basis points  but seeing that there doesnt seem to be much interest in that i wont try to reconcile
the music and lyrics of c which announces a target and then says were going to miss it but i had a
couple of suggestions to try to bring that together  so let me confine the balance of my remarks to
the choice between a and b
i think in alternative a we are allin  it makes the new regime explicit  it is likely to be
somewhat of a surprise to markets and puts a large burden on all of usparticularly you mr
chairmannot only in the next few hours but really for the next days and weeks in describing with
great rigor what the new regime is  i think were up to that but it is certainly a tall task at a time of
great uncertainty in markets  the way i would try to make that task a little easier is through various
channelssuggesting that we are in some ways revealing the new target in paragraph 5 by
suggesting that the implied effective target is 25 basis points given what our change is on the
discount rate and the interest rate on reserves  so that i think has a way of making the transition to
the new regime less massive than it might be and reinforces my zero phobia point  i think thats one
way in which the bold new regime with a lot of explanation in the next few weeks can at least be
not as scary to the markets in the next couple of days
what about alternative b  if we were to go in that direction id make one modest
suggestion  in the first paragraph i would insert the word betweenso the federal open
market committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate between zero
and  percentto suggest that youre not going to be at that endpoint  now ill admit thats not a
massive change but it makes me feel a bit better about my phobia and about how markets banks
and others might react knowing that that is a point you do not want to cross  so a suggestion there
now on your open question setting a range in terms of the optimal level of inflation or not
im not crazy about a range  but if we have a range i think it is scary lurchy to include it today
and so i wouldnt do it  conditionality i think is fine  i dont feel strongly about our considering
treasury securities  i do like governor kohns suggestion about deleting to continue because
bold new regimes arent continuations of what weve done  theyre bold and new  so i think thats
an important change by governor kohn  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  obviously you have a bleak outlook  its very
important to act quickly and decisively and i think its clear from the discussion that our choice is
between a and b  but as a number of people have mentioned the economic substance is probably
nearly identical in alternatives a and b  our exposition of it though can make a very big
difference
there are an enormous number of moving parts and there is a lot to digest  we potentially
have here as i count them seven new things that people have brought up  thats just an enormous
amount to deal with and i think some of them we want to delay  the inflation target is very
important but it brings up issues here and im not sure that we want to talk about something like
that now  so let me just quickly run through these
we have to think about the dynamic of what we are going to say next time  what is this
committing us to talk about  first the rate cut is one very big issue75 versus 50 basis points
although some market participants think it will be 75 i think that will still be news but i think its
very important for us to move there  second just moving to a range is something new i think that
is something that is actually quite newsworthy in and of itself  going to no target at all is extremely
newsworthy maybe too newsworthy to include with all these other things  i think of this and the
discussions that weve had as setting up an extremely valuable template for how we should be
thinking about the statement and what we need to be explaining today as well as over the next few
meetings  so i would actually say that given all of the moving parts and all of the changes talking
about a range either between or of zero to  percent would make a lot of sense  i dont think
were introducing any more ambiguity  i think were introducing a bit of ambiguity especially for
people who are not that well informed by saying that we dont have a target anymore  what
president yellen said was that it could easily be misinterpreted as gosh we dont really have
control over these things anymore anyway  i dont think any of us believes that and i think theres
more of a chance of that misinterpretation which i dont want us to have if we do that today with
all the other changes than if we waited a little  i still think the range is a pretty big shift
expressing concerns about inflation being less than the level fostering economic growth
again i think thats something that i would prefer to wait on  i like president sterns edit about
talking about the appreciable diminution of inflationary pressures but i would wait on putting in the
phrase about whether the level is too low to be consistent with fostering economic growth  i
mentioned the inflation target  i think we should wait on that  were introducing conditionality
which i think is valuable to do and i think the phrase there is fine  were talking about old and new
programs as well as balance sheet issues  as a number of people have mentioned we have already
talked about standing ready to expand the purchases of agency securities as conditions warrant  so
thats forward leaning already  if we are committed to doing the treasury securities fairly soon i
think we should just go along with that and feel comfortable with that  but we do have to think a bit
about the precedent of making concrete new policies that weve generally talked about in this
statement  is it something that we want to do going forward  does this commit us to doing that  i
dont think so but i think we should just think about that
then i think its very important that we talk about the use of the balance sheet  i agree with
governor warsh that to be bold you dont say continue to  but we are talking about some
existing programs so in some sense we are continuing  im not quite sure exactly where we want to
go on this but i just wanted to raise that ambiguity  on the balance sheet though i go back to the
chairmans remarks from yesterday  it is important to think about the composition of the balance
sheet not just the size in and of itselfgovernor kohn also made reference to thisso i would be
very wary of focusing on the size here  i think that just talking about ways to use the balance sheet
is the appropriate way to go now  if we have more experience and understand better how the size
might evolve over time how the different programs we have might fluctuate id feel more
comfortable with that  if we talk about the size or commitment to growth of that size or expecting it
to be large just as a number of people said it could suddenly shrink and we dont want people to
think that were changing monetary policy because of that  some of these things would just be
changing over time  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i do favor alternative a  in terms of what will
happen with the prime rate i frankly dont know but i think it will leave the banks to determine
their own prime rate and floors as they wish  i would not minimize the fact that we are actually still
setting a rate for the interest on excess reserves as well as the discount rate  this experience with
interest on reserves is brand new for us and i dont think weve had enough experience to know
how it is actually going to work  it does leave room for the spread to establish itself as the fed funds
market regenerates and i think it gives us some room to have some experience with that regime  i
think this communicates the regime change better than any of the other alternatives and at the end
of the day this is a communication document  i would strongly echo president pianaltos
comments that in this new regime we really need to stay on the same page to avoid total confusion
in the marketplace  i know that independence of thought is one of the strengths of this body but if
we could for a time set that aside at least in public and all speak from the same talking points it
would make all of our policies more effective
in terms of the specifics of the statement i would defer to another day the language in
brackets in paragraph 2 of alternative a  the conditional language i would keep in  about the
phrase to continue and really all of paragraph 4 to my mind although we are continuing some of
the things that the board has done it has not necessarily been clear that all of these have been
considered by the fomc  to me this takes everything we are doing and puts it in the middle of this
table and gives us time to discuss which of them we like what we might use or not use and how we
might express the degree to which we would use all of these tools  weve made a lot of progress in
a very short time in coming to the broad outlines of the things that we might do going forward and
in coming meetings well actually contour those more and make them more specific  i would
include that as well  as to whether or not we use our balance sheet or expand our balance
sheet i would leave it at this point as use our balance sheet and have further discussion on that
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  boy youve left me a simple task  yes a two
hander from president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i just want to come back to a point i suggested  is there any
sense in transposing paragraphs 3 and 4 to emphasize the new regime
chairman bernanke  well let me comment
mr fisher  yes sir
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  in light of our discussion of use of in this balance sheet quantitative i
was going to point out that president plossers suggestion about a specific number for an upper
bound on the size of our balance sheet would remedy the problem that we were discussing there  in
addition it would greatly alleviate the deep discomfort i and perhaps others may have about our
governance practices and the extent to which theyre publicly known  i would also emphasize that
there are two theories about the effect of our balance sheet and that this is written from the credit
spreads point of view and it would be useful to encompass both
chairman bernanke  let me just say generally speaking that we are making a lot
of changes here  id like to suggest that we move gradually  but one suggestion i did like and
would propose to see if it helps you is first vice president cummings suggestion of saying that
well provide support with measures that sustain the size of the federal reserve balance sheet at a
high level  that makes it very explicit  later we can go further about quantitative guidelines and so
forth but for the moment were saying that the balance sheet size itself is of importance
mr lacker  because the word size is a quantitative word it does a lot better than
use of which is ambiguous about sterilization  so to that extent i view first vice president
cummings suggestion as very positive
chairman bernanke  president plosser does that satisfy you for today
mr plosser  would you read that again please  im sorry mr chairman  this is very
difficult
chairman bernanke  just for today the focus of policy going forward will be to
support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market
operations and other measures that sustain the size of the federal reserves balance sheet at a high
level
mr plosser  i think it is the focus of the fomcs monetary policy
chairman bernanke  the focus of the committees policy
mr plosser  of the committees policyfine
chairman bernanke  is that okay
mr plosser  yes much improved
chairman bernanke  all right  so in the spirit of trying to move gradually and not
just overwhelm the market i would like as i say to move halfway to where we want to be  there
was a slight majority in favor of alternative a but im very concerned that if we dont say anything
about the funds rate there is just going to be confusion  i am also concerned about the view that
president yellen governor kroszner and others raised if we sort of say that were not targeting it
anymore  it suggests that were indifferent to the rate or that we have no ability to raise it  what
does it mean to say that rates will be kept low for a long time if we dont have some view on that
again i would cite the japanese precedent  i understand the concerns about community banks  i
do think thats not a reason that should control our policy and they certainly can change their
pricing policy  so let me make some suggestions  brian will someone take notes  then we can
come back  in order to be conservative and avoid risk i would like to propose alternative b  in the
first paragraph i would take governor warshs suggestion and say target range for the federal
funds rate between 0 and  percent
mr lacker  im sorry  say that again
chairman bernanke  target range for the federal funds rate of between 0 and
 percent
mr lacker  of between
chairman bernanke  oh sorry  not of between but a target for the federal funds
rate between 0 and  percent
mr lacker  so the target is between
mr kohn  a target or a target range
chairman bernanke  target range
mr lacker  target range is between
chairman bernanke  the target range for the federal funds rate between 0 and 
percent
mr lacker  so the target range is to be between those two numbers
chairman bernanke  all right  okay  scratch it  paragraph 1 is the same  thats
simple  paragraph 2 is the same including the additional sentence about financial markets no
longer bolded  paragraph 3 president stern was right about quickly  why dont we say
appreciably  now a lot of people have talked about inflation targets  i think we should look at
that very seriously  today is not the day to do it  maybe that should be introduced simultaneously
with concerns about deflation  i propose that we strike the bracketed material but put the word
further after moderate  the committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming
quarters  the fourth paragraph as ismost people were okay with the conditionality there  in the
fifth paragraph strike continue to  the focus of the committees policy going forward will be to
support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market
operations and other measures that sustain the size of the federal reserves balance sheet at a high
level  you know i get the sense from the committee that they will entertain purchases of treasury
securities in the next quarter or so  in order not to jerk the market around too much i think we
should therefore mention it and leave it where it is  so the only change in paragraph 5 that im
proposing is in the first sentence
mr kroszner  so the last sentence will have continue to or not
chairman bernanke  okay  lets see  yes i think it has to be there  the federal
reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet  i think we have to say that
because we have used it
ms duke  would that say the committee
chairman bernanke  sorry
ms duke  would that say the committee will or the federal reserve will  perhaps
the committee will continue to consider ways to use the federal reserve balance sheet
chairman bernanke  the committee will continue to consider ways of using the
federal reserves balance sheet  i think we should leave it where it is  just leave it ambiguous for
now if thats okay  so those are the changes  brian would you like just to read that  are you able
to read it that  do you have the information
mr madigan  yes
chairman bernanke  would you go ahead and read the thing
mr madigan  the federal open market committee decided today to establish a target
range for the federal funds rate of 0 to  percent  since the committees last meeting labor market
conditions have deteriorated and the available data indicate that consumer spending business
investment and industrial production have declined  financial markets remain quite strained and
credit conditions tight  overall the outlook for economic activity has weakened further
meanwhile inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably  in light of the declines in
the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity the
committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters
the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of
sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability  in particular the committee
anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the
federal funds rate for some time
the focus of the committees policy going forward will be to support the functioning of
financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures
that sustain the size of the federal reserves balance sheet at a high level  as previously
announced over the next few quarters the federal reserve will purchase large quantities of agency
debt and mortgagebacked securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets and it
stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities as conditions
warrant  the committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longerterm
treasuries securities  early next year the federal reserve will also implement the term asset
backed securities loan facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small
businesses  the federal reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further
support credit markets and economic activity
chairman bernanke  and then the related action  president plosser
mr plosser  this is a clarification mr chairman  i hate to be difficult but in thinking
about this as a step we talked about an inflation target  what other steps do you see that we need to
clarify as we try to make this process moreim looking for some forwardlooking language here
chairman bernanke  well we need to talk about it  i think there are two promising
directions  one is to have an inflation target or something close to an inflation target depending on
how the committee decides what we think is feasible and so on  the other would be to develop a
more formalized structure for discussing the integrated responsibilities we have with respect to the
balance sheet and that could involve quantitative ranges for example  i didnt quite like your
ceiling because i think in some cases you might want to have a floor  but i dont think as i said
yesterday that we can describe our policies in a single number and i dont think that a target for the
overall size of the balance sheet is a sufficient statistic for what were doing  but i do think that for
governance and other reasons we can talk about ranges consultation and so on about the size of
the balance sheet  okay  again i apologize that this is an imperfect document  given the many
moving parts as i said i wanted to try to keep it from being too overwhelming  this is going to be
a big enough step as it is  governor kohn
mr kohn  just one further clarification  by sustaining the balance sheet at a high level
were not promising that it wont fall from here right  just that it will be higher than it ordinarily
would be
chairman bernanke  that its going to be above 800 billion for some time i would
think is a fair statement  does anyone else have a comment  governor warsh
mr warsh  i apologize for the bad english that i offered before but an alternative to the
first sentence that you read that would i think be english to jeffs fair pointit would be to delete
the word target  so it says to establish a range for the federal funds rate between zero and
 percent  so those are your two options
mr lacker  but its the same issue  range is the noun and youre saying that the
range lies between those things and youre not telling everyone what the range is
chairman bernanke  it would be a range of 0 to  percent  i think that would be
right
participants  right
mr warsh  withdrawn
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i cant support that and ill tell you why  i do feel that we
had an elegant solution in alternative a  i firmly believe that if we target 0 to 25 basis pointsthe
effective funds rate we all know is trading at 116it is going to create enormous backlash  it is
unacceptable to me to say that the bankers will figure out how to deal with this  they cant
second as far as money market funds are concerned the expense load is usually 30 basis points  so
for whatever it is worth i will be a minority of one but i cannot support that  alternative a was
elegant in that it made no statement  then and i think very important by dwelling on this business
of what our target rate is we diminish what were doing and what were doing is changing things
fundamentally which i fully support
so for whatever its worth i understand all the counterarguments  janet and i have talked
about this  i know what people are going to say  i think a it is an unnecessary distraction b it
creates a potential political backlash and c it is counterproductive  so i just want to state it myself
straightforwardly and honestlyi may be the only person at this table but ill vote against that  if
you give us alternative a ill vote for it  i know im one of 17 at this tablethere are more than 17
people at this table  i apologize but i dont think its necessary to make the funds rate clear  its
implied in what were doing but alternative a gives people enough ambiguity to steer around it
and thats my opinion  i apologize
chairman bernanke  i think confusion is an extraordinarily dangerous thing for us
mr fisher  the key is paragraph 4 in alternative athat is what were doing
chairman bernanke  no i agree with that  what b says is that this is the end of
one regime and the beginning of another  the first one says that this is the end and then we say
what are we doing going forward  i think that clarity is needed  if we did what youre suggesting i
dont know for sure what would happen but i think there would be a lot of commentary and
questions  what are they saying  what do they mean  that would be much more than what b
does  i understand your point  i thought hard about it and i know that there was a mixture of
views  governor duke
ms duke  id like to ask one question just again about going forward  we talked about
what you would do differently tomorrow under alternatives a and b and determined that it was
nothing  what would you do going forward if federal funds started to trade above 25 basis points
under alternative b
mr dudley  well i guess we would stop doing reverse repos to signal our protesting of
the fact that the fed funds rate is trading soft to its targets  thats the first thing wed do  i have to
say that i think the probability of this happening is extremely remote because banks are balance
sheet constrained and therefore arent going to do that perfect arbitrage  maybe in a normal world it
would be possible to get fed funds to trade above the interest on excess reserves but in this world
its just extraordinarily unlikely  but if it were to happen we would signal our unhappiness with
that and the first thing we would do is wed stop doing the reverses that weve been doing every
day to protest the softness in the funds rate
ms duke  but you would be able to pull it back down
mr dudley  i dont know how quickly we could pull it back down  look  i dont think
that this is going to happen under almost any conceivable circumstance but if it were to happen we
would basically add reserves to protest what were seeing  time would pass  wed have another
fomc meeting and we would make an adjustment to the framework  but i think this is an
extremely remote possibility
chairman bernanke  first vice president cumming
ms cumming  i think that if we see the risk of institutional factors like the way the
prime rate is linked to rates really getting in the way of good policy we have an obligation to work
with the banking community work with other regulators if necessary and work with the sec if
necessary to clear those institutional obstacles  so i wouldnt let the institutional things be
something that gets in our way rather they would be something that we can really help overcome
where we see problems  that link could be changed and we may want to work actively with the
banking community to make sure that it happens
chairman bernanke  no clearly the banks are not required to move their prime rate
with anything in particular
mr fisher  of course  they can always have their markup but you can also reverse the
argument and say so why do you want to cut rates  again i think were pushing on a string here
mr chairman  forgive me for speaking but the guts of what were doing and the importance of
what were doing which i fully support are in paragraph 4 and i believe were distracting from that
by focusing on the fed funds rate
chairman bernanke  i agree with what youre saying about the important part but it
is nevertheless the case thatas president yellen pointed outif we wanted to we could raise the
funds rate if we put on enough pressure  therefore in an important sense a decision is being made
here to end this particular policy approach and to move clearly to another one with the words the
focus of the committees policies going forward will be and that is described in a lengthy
paragraph  i am just so concerned about what will happen if we say were not going to target it
what does that mean  is it going to be 5 percent tomorrow  i just fear the confusion  president
hoenig
mr hoenig  in terms of what were going to be speaking about regarding the new
regime i think it was easier when we had alternative a and we were going to a new regime than
when were saying well okay were going to end this regime here  im giving this speech i get
questions  were going to end this regime and were going to go to this  so now im in the middle
of a transition and im trying to explain it but other than yes we left this behind and here we are
going forward  so thats my concern about the middle step here  i guess in your opinion its easier
to explain going from heres the old regime were going to stick to it for a little while longer and
then   
chairman bernanke  no  today is the end of the old regime  we have hit zero
we cant go further  going forward this is what were going to do  i think thats clearer  again
im just concerned about not saying what were doing with the funds rate  are we going to let it do
whatever it wants to do from today  i think thats just going to create volatility  again im sorry
for those who are in disagreement
mr dudley  for what its worth mr chairman i agree with you  i think the market
will be more confused about alternative a than alternative b  if thats important then that should
be part of the decision
mr fisher  but i asked you that during the question period
mr dudley  i said substantively were not going to conduct policy any differently but
the market will be more confused about a than about b in terms of having to process what this
means  now it will get to the right answer eventually but it will be more confused in terms of
processing information in my opinion
mr kroszner  i just want to underscore that because that was my concern in moving
toward b rather than a because i certainly agree that the economic substance is the same  but i do
think theres much more of an opportunity for misinterpretation by the market and for us to say that
we dont have control of the fed funds rate is the main concern that i have with a  i think b is very
clear  the idea of talking about a range including zero is something that at least as far as i know
the fed has never done before and i think thats an enormous shift  that will be seen as a real shift
but to go to a would have ambiguity and would be very difficult to explain to people who are not
real aficionados that were not saying gosh we really dont have the opportunity to fix the federal
funds rate anymore  that piece is broken
mr fisher  i heard eleven people argue the case for alternative a  i counted them
chairman bernanke  most of them said it was pretty close and its a matter of
communication  its my judgment that we are just going to cause a lot of criticism and a lot of
concern and confusion if we do it now  i also agree that its fairly close  but my feeling is that the
concern of clarity is more important to me  others  would you call the roll please
mr madigan  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr madigan  there is also the issue of the directive
chairman bernanke  the directive would stand as weve written it with the
additional sentence at the end
ms danker  yes thats right  the vote will encompass the statement as brian madigan
read it and the draft directive for alternative b as was shown in the handout  since it is longer this
time and we are short of time i wont read it
chairman bernanke                             yes first vice president cumming             yes governor duke                                    yes
president fisher                                   no
governor kohn                                   yes
governor kroszner                              yes
president pianalto                                yes
president plosser                                 with some reluctance i will vote yes
president stern                                    yes
governor warsh                                  yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  could we bring lunch back  would that work
ms danker  that doesnt usually work well in a recorded session
chairman bernanke  that doesnt work well  all right  lets have half an hour for
lunch
mr madigan  the board meeting mr chairman
chairman bernanke  the board meeting is adjourned  hold on  the board will go
into my office  everyone else lunch  we will take a half hour break and then we have just a few
short items afterwards to complete  okay  thank you
lunch break
chairman bernanke  lets reconvene briefly for a couple of other items  on
consideration in order to maintain a united front with the committee president fisher changed
his vote to vote yes on the resolution  we have two items  first governor kohn is going to
talk a bit about our longerterm projection and then we would like just to hear a bit from bill
dudley and pat parkinson about the talf  we have had several previous briefings on this but
we will update this and talk a bit about its implications for balance sheet management  governor
kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  you should have gotten memos from the
subcommittee on communications having to do with the longerterm projections  in
considering the trial run and also the current situation in which the 09 10 and 11 projections
really werent settling down and didnt look as though they would soon settle down into what
would be consistent with where we would want things to be in the long term  in these
circumstances the subcommittee thought it would be a good idea to go ahead with a quarterly
extension of the projections to give the public a better idea of where we thought output growth
employment and inflation were expected to be over the longer run
we made four recommendations within that overall recommendation  we recommended
that we do it quarterly not just once a year and that the discussion be integrated with the rest of
the quarterly projection process in the summary of economic projections  we also
recommended that we continue to do this for total pce inflation but as we did in the trial run
not do it for core pce to emphasize to the public that it was the total we were looking at over the
long run and not the core  we thought that the questionnaire should ask each participant to
provide your best assessment of the rate to which each variable would converge over the longer
term say five to six years from now in the absence of shocks and assuming appropriate
monetary policy  this would be something that didnt emphasize the fact that it was five or six
years but where things would settle down and it might take five or six years to settle down  so
those are our recommendations  did i missing anythingim looking at the subcommittee
members
after todays and yesterdays discussions i think the subcommittee will also take another
look at whether the committee should move further in the direction of an inflation target and get
some material to the committee before the january meeting  i think we are not looking for a
vote on this today but if anybody has any views about whether this is the appropriate direction in
which to go i would like to hear them
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i think the subcommittee ought to consider whether if the committee
adopts a 2 percent or whatever inflation objective it might be more confusing than clarifying for
us to also be issuing these longrange convergence projections  my first cut at thinking this
throughi havent given this a lot of thoughtis that if we are going to say our target is x i
dont see why we would even need these
chairman bernanke  this is why they need to look at it now because i think they
really are substitutes
mr lacker  yes i think they are substitutes
mr kohn  you might still need the output and unemployment
mr lacker  what for  we dont controlwell you know thatsorry
chairman bernanke  any other comments or questions
mr plosser  i guess given the zero lower bound issues that we have been discussing
and some of the consequences of being there the difficulty of dealing with policy in that
environment in previous meetings on this topic we have talked about the prospects of specifying
the funds rate path or the range of the funds rate paths of committee members and their
projections  it was suggested earlier that had we done that previously we might be in a position
to signal to the markets more about our commitment to inflation or something like that  so i
guess what im saying in the context of both inflation targeting and its projections giving that a
second round of thought in terms of how it might fit in with that would be useful under some
circumstances
chairman bernanke  okay  anyone else  all right  let me turn to bill who
very kindly learned that he was on the program about fifteen hours ago
mr dudley  it is better than the time i found out i had to discuss a stiglitz paper in grad school about 12 hours ahead of time  that was harder  i read the stiglitz paper three times and then i started to understand it  laughter  what i thought i would do if i could is invert the order and start with the balance sheet issues and then go into the talf because i think that there is a broader question of our exit from all our liquidity programs  that is a very legitimate issue  you can imagine a circumstance that sometime in the future we still have an inflated balance sheet and we actually want to raise the federal funds rate target  the question is would we be able to do so
the good news of course is that a lot of our facilities are going to go away pretty naturallythe swaps the cpff and the taf  we may have to give it a bit of a nudge but those programs should downsize pretty automatically  even after that we are still going to have on our books a lot more agency debt and a lot more agency mortgagebacked securities  were going to have loans outstanding that are associated with bear stearns and aig  we are going to have longerterm treasuries we have potentially a very large funding obligation to citigroup if its losses go through the fdic and tarp money  then of course the talf could also still be on our balance sheet depending on what the terms of those talf loans are  i am going to come back to that a little later
generally i am not worried about our ability to raise the level of interest rates even if our balance sheet is still inflated at the time for a number of reasons  first i think the interest rate on excess reserves does work just not quite as well as we had
hoped  the gap between the interest on excess reserves and the effective funds rate has been running in the 40 to 50 basis point range  that means that if we were to raise the interest rate on excess reserves we would raise the whole complex of interest rates including the effective fed funds rate  the gap is as large as it is because when balance sheet capacity is scarce people have to be paid to use their balance sheet to arbitrage that difference  but i think that gap today is pretty stable and we can expect that as the balance sheets return to a more normal condition over time that gap might actually narrow as people say well gee i have more balance sheet capacity to do this arbitrage  so that would be point number 1
point number 2 is that we can probably take active steps that reduce the cost of that arbitrage to banks today  we can limit the gses in terms of their fed funds sales and we can also reduce the balance sheet consequence of the arbitrage by potentially removing those purchases from the leverage ratio giving them a little regulatory relief which actually makes some sense because there is really no risk to a bank that is buying fed funds from another bank and putting them on deposit with the fed
there is no interest rate risk overnight  so that is something that we might want to consider
another thing that i think is important to recognize is that there may be other means of addressing our excess reserves problems  the first point is that interest on excess reserves is probably good enough to do a reasonable if somewhat sloppy job in pushing up interest rates  in addition to that we have other ways of addressing excess reserves in the system  we have the ability to change our monetary policy framework  we had a meeting earlier this year in which we discussed some of the potential places we might want to go  to drain excess reserves if we decided that was necessary to get better control of the federal funds rate we could do reverse repos with a broader set of counterparties like money market mutual funds  we could do that using the agency debt on our balance sheet and using the treasury debt on our balance sheet and we could probably do that in size since the money market funds would be very happy to be our counterparts
second we could also change the monetary framework in a more radical way one can imagine a system by which we set voluntary reserve targets for banks at pretty high levels where the rate they got if they were above the target dropped off considerably and the rate they got below the target dropped off considerably  so we could basically give the banks incentives to hold the amount of their excess reserves that actually are in the banking system
third the treasury could help us as it was helping us for a while  the sfp bills actually did work  the problem was that as the treasurys borrowing needs skyrocketed it started to worry about running into the debt limit  what actually happenedit was a political issueit didnt want to notify the congress 60 days ahead of time that it might hit the debt limit and that is really why it started backing away from the sfps  now we could resolve this in a couple of different ways  one if the debt limit were raised enough you would have plenty of room  or you could
potentially exempt the sfps from the debt limit and you could argue that doing so makes sense because there is debt here and there is cash on the federal reserve balance sheet so no real net debt is created
last you could gain legislative authority to issue fed bills which i think is actually a little more radical step  but the attractiveness of that of course is then we have complete control over our destiny and you dont have the mushing together of church and state where we are at least somewhat dependent on the treasury for managing our monetary policy  so the bottom line for me is that i dont think we should be concerned about the large size of our balance sheet constraining our ability to manage our interest rate policy going forward  that should not be a driver of what we decide about our liquidity facilities
so why is this important  well the talf just to recap is a program in which we would basically lend funds against aaarated consumer assetbacked securities on a nonrecourse basis to basically anyonenot quite anyone not foreigners but pretty much anyone who wants to do itand we would conduct these transactions through the dealer community  in the talf program we would be offering three things to investors  first they would be offered more leverage than they can get today because the haircuts that we would put on the securities would not be the 50 percent type of haircuts that the market is putting in place today  they might be 10 percent 20 percent or 30 percent  we are still negotiating determining that  so investors could get a lot more leverage than they can get today  the second thing that would be offered is protection against tail risk and that is something that investors very definitely cant get today  because the loan would be nonrecourse the investor could lose only the amount of the haircut and that is really important in a world where prices are very volatile  so that would significantly reduce the marktomarket risk of investing in the securities from the perspective of investors  finally probably the most important thing we would be providing term funding  people could buy these securities which are of relatively long duration  it depends on what security you are looking at but the securities probably range in duration from two years to seven or eight years if you are looking at student loans  so this facility would not work if the term were very very short
we have been in the process of going out and talking quite extensively to issuers and investors over the past couple of weeks  the board staff has been involved  the new york fed staff has been involved  basically what we found out is that they like the program  the leverage is not quite as important as we thought  they said they could live with less leverage rather than more leverage  they like the protection against the tail risk  the nonrecourse nature of the loans of course is very attractive but the main thing on which they focused and that they said was most important for the success of the program was the length of the term of the loans  when we went forward with the initial term sheet we were talking about a oneyear term and the investors have come back quite forcefully and said that a oneyear term is not sufficient  the program will not work with a oneyear term  now maybe they are exaggerating the degree to which it wouldnt work but it does seem fairly credible
that there is no reassurance that one year from now we are going to be completely out of the situation that we are in today  so certainly it is completely legitimate to be worried as an investor about the rollover risk one year from now given that these are assets of longer durations
where i come out on all of this is that i think we really do need to be attentive to that concern and we should try to make the term of the talf loans as long as possible subject to protecting the fed obviously from credit losses  if we were to make it short term i think there is a high probability that the program would fail  i think that would be a huge blow to our credibility  up to now we have done pretty well in wheeling out programs that have done what we said they were going to do  i think this is a particularly important program because of its ability to be expanded in multiple directions  the treasury is very very interested in this program as a way of using tarp capital efficiently  so to wheel this out on terms that are too short and that make the program unattractive would be very very damaging to our credibility my view is that we should be willing to offer these loans at term  i would favor three years  i think if we do that this program will be successful  obviously if we do that we are going to have more balances on our books  this program was originally conceived of as about a 200 billion program  that is probably as big as it would get for consumer abs but obviously if we expand it to cmbs and other things it could be considerably larger than that  so that is sort of where we are  pat do you have anything you want to add
mr parkinson  no i dont think so  again i think the message as bill is saying
from the investors and the issuers was that a threeyear term would greatly enhance the chances
of success  indeed i think our friends in the treasury department at least in the case of
governmentguaranteed loans would like to go even longer than that  but both the board staff
and the new york staff thought that it would work best at three years
mr dudley  three years gets you far enough along that reasonable people will
believe that three years from now you might actually be able to get privatesector financing for
this stuff
chairman bernanke  i am going to need to consult on an informal basis with the
other board members on this  but in the spirit of our discussion yesterday i invite questions or
comments which will inform our thinking on this as well  does anyone have any questions or
thoughts on this  president lacker
mr lacker  you said that investors who bought this and put this and got the lending
would have the haircut at risk right
mr dudley  yes
mr lacker  they would get all of the upside
mr dudley  yes
mr lacker  so if spreads close in the marketplace then they get the upsideso we
are essentially lending to them to make a leveraged bet on the securities
mr dudley  the purpose of this facility is not to give investors profits  the purpose
of this facility is to address the fact that lending spreads on aaarated securities are extremely
wide right now and the securitization market is closed  the idea is that if you offer more
attractive terms than those available in the market the demand for these securities will increase
issuers will be able to sell these securities at better prices and lower spreads and the
consequences of that will be lower lending rates and improved credit availability to households
the goal at the end of the day is not to do anything for investors  the goal is to harness
investors profit motivation to drive down spreads in the aaa market
mr lacker  i understand  now why are spreads high
mr dudley  our view is that spreads are high mainly because people cant get
leveragethat is number 1  number 2 the traditional buyers of these aaarated assets either
have disappeared completely like sivs and bank conduits or have balance sheet constraints  so
the risk capital hasnt really been willing to come in because they cant get the financing to make
it worth their while  you know libor plus 300 is not an attractive proposition for someone
who is using capital on an unleveraged basis
mr lacker  when i think about leverage and the demand for a given security if i as
an investor am going to make a leveraged purchase then whoever is giving me a loan to make
that is also taking a risk position in the security  so the demand that leveraged investors make is
really a joint demand by them and the lenders  everything you have said sounds as if demand is
low  am i missing something here
mr dudley  the demand is low for these securities today  it is low because of lack
of leverage
mr lacker  in other words im saying that people who would provide funding also
have a low demand or a low evaluation of the value of those securities  this all amounts to a
bunch of people out there putting a low value on these securities
mr dudley  no i dont think that is quite right  we are in basically a market
disequilibrium where the traditional buyers of these securities have vanished  in a normal
market environment it would be completely reasonable to lend against these securities on a
leveraged basis  but the people who would do that lendingbanks and dealersare balance
sheet constrained and that is why they are not willing to make those loans  if we had a normal
banking and dealer situation today in which they were willing to extend loans to their
counterparties they would be providing the leverage  but that is just not happening
mr lacker  do you mean they are not making purchases  they still existright
you said buyers vanished
mr parkinson  the lenders i think he was saying  some of the buyers vanished in
the sense that they were sivs or a lot of them were actually securities lenders who were
reinvesting their cash collateral in this and they have learned a lesson about doing that
mr lacker  what evidence do you have that their absence from the market doesnt
reflect just adverse views about the value of the securities that we should treat the way we treat
all other security evaluation decisions that market participants make
mr dudley  well i think the counterfactual is what the investors tell us  they tell
us that that is not the case
mr lacker  well wait  these are the ones who would be aided by this program
right
mr dudley  if you look at aaarated assets the historical credit risk on these assets
is very very low
mr lacker  over the cycle or in a recession
mr dudley  yesterday we talked about aaa tranches of student loans which are
97 percent backed by the department of education  they are selling at libor plus 300 or
libor plus 400  it is hard to say that those securities are priced there because of credit risk
mr lacker  what would a security like that have sold for in 1974 or 1981
mr dudley  i would be very surprised if you saw anything similar to what we are
seeing today
mr lacker  well they didnt exist them so we cant look it up for one  so how do
we know these are out of bounds with what they would have traded at
mr dudley  jeff this is all a judgment call  we have been making lots of judgment
calls
mr lacker  yes i know  but you are not giving us any evidence about this bill
you are not bringing anything coherent that is
chairman bernanke  there is an ongoing discussion about whether prices in
markets are in some sense pareto optimal prices or whether there is liquidity risk other
premiums that the central bank could do something about  i dont know any way to resolve it
we have the same discussion each time  president hoenig
mr hoenig  all right  so we are going to give them a threeyear term to give them
assurances that they dont have to worry about rolling over  i am assuming that as the market
improvesand it should over the next year or 18 monthsthis would be almost selfliquidating
because it would then become attractive to these parties to leave now and that would be taking it
off our balance sheet  is that the operating assumption
mr dudley  well it really depends on what rate we are charging for the loan
presumably we are going to charge for the loan at a rate that is attractive in times of extremis and
somewhat expensive in normal times  so the question really is will the market financing
improve quickly enough to make the market a cheaper source of funds  i dont think we can
count on all of these loans going away before the end of the term  i think we have to presume
that the term could actually be three years because we just dont know whether the financing will
be available from the private sector sooner
mr hoenig  that puts us at risk of taking a loss then if we should decide to reverse
the policy action
mr parkinson  but we could accelerate that process by raising the minimum rate at
which we would lend and so make it a higher spread above libor  if we are going to do it through
an auctionthere are still some questions about how to allocate the credit within this programand
if there is a minimum rate at which we would make funds available in the auction that would be the
spread over libor and we adjust that spread upward were giving them more of a push to go
back to relying on market financing
mr hoenig  that would be the idealto push them back out as quickly as possible
when the market straightens out
mr dudley  well i think the idea would be that the window for this program would not
be three years  it would be a shorter period of time  so the program would come to an end by the
end of 2009 perhaps but the loans that we had made during that period could be outstanding for
some time beyond that
mr hoenig  but were talking about a lot of assets on our books
mr dudley  the other thing that we should talk a bit about is credit risk to the fed in all
of this  i think the important thing to recognize here is that the credit risk to the fed is quite low
because the federal reserve is protected by two things  one it is protected by the haircuts  the
feds risk is a credit risk not a marktomarket risk  two the fed is also protected by the tarp
money  the way this will work is that to the extent that people put securities to us we take those
securities and we place them in a disposition spv special purpose vehicle thats capitalized by
tarp money  weve been doing a lot of work recently about how risky these assets are and what
the risk of loss is to the fed  it turns out that its very hard to generate scenarios in which the fed
has any meaningful risk of loss
mr hoenig  i have no problem with that  what im thinking about is if we do define a
new regime how we conduct policy  how are we tying ourselves down now relative to what we
might want to do in the future in moving these assets on and off our balance sheet  i think that the
more flexibility we have in moving them out the more flexibility we have in any new regime we
put forward and to me thats important
chairman bernanke  governor kohn did you have a comment
mr kohn  a comment and a question  one comment to follow up on your comment
mr chairman to president lackeri think theres pretty good evidence that there are liquidity
strains in the market beyond just credit strains impinging on the price of these securities  one
piece of evidence i would cite is the difference between ontherun and the offtherun treasury
security rates which have gapped out by 40 or 50 basis points even fromwell im not even sure
where they are relative to 98 but i think theyre at record levels  the unwillingness of peopleby
people i mean market makersto take positions and to do tradestheir cautionis affecting the
pricing of all kinds of securities well beyond the credit risk and obviously theres no difference in
the credit risk in ontherun and offtherun treasury securities
mr dudley  cash bonds versus derivatives for example
mr kohn  right  the point that bill made yesterday was that the equivalent things are
selling at very different rates and no one is doing the arbitrage  second i like the model that bill
just described in which the federal reserve supplies liquidity but the private sector plus the
treasury takes the credit risk  i think that puts us in the right place and puts the taxpayer in the right
place  so i think its a good idea to get this thing working and look for other opportunities to use it
with the agreement of the treasury  we cant do it by ourselves
my questions are that i thought we had some feedback along two lines id like to hear your
comment on  one is that aaa wasnt enough that when we started this we thought doing just
aaa tranches would restart the markets  so comment on that  the other question is about the
nonleveraged purchasers of this paper  were not really catering to them and will it be successful
soon
mr dudley  okay  on the aaait is really for specific classes  i think weve heard
that somehow the aaa would not be sufficient mostly from the auto loan area  its hard to judge
how credible that is given that the aaa is the big bulk of the capital structure  so if youre getting
good financing for most of the capital structure its hard to believe that you cant pay people at the
bottom of the capital structure a high enough rate to induce them to do that  so i think im a little
skeptical that this is true  i think that this program will be successful even if we confine it to just
aaa
mr parkinson  even of those who are saying that today theyre having trouble not
only placing the aaa but also placing the other tranches a number say that if you could start
pricing the aaa tranche that would make placing the others a lot easier  basically youd be
determining how much of the spread income from the underlying assets has to go to the aaa and
that tells you how much you have left to compensate the lower rated
mr dudley  you can figure out the economics better once you know how much you
have to pay for that 75 percent of the capital structure
mr kohn  on the nonleveraged
mr dudley  i dont think this program addresses the nonleveraged but i think theres
not much nonleveraged interest in this sector at this point
mr parkinson  well thats the fundamental problem  again some of them were
these classes of investors who are no longer around  even if they were around i dont think wed
want them aroundthe siv and securities lenders et cetera  but then you have the pension funds
the insurance companies and so forth that are not in the market and this really doesnt do anything
at least initially to bring them back to the market  we have scratched our heads at some length
trying to figure out a program that the federal reserve could develop that would entice them into
the market  but i think the fundamental problem is that our tool is the ability to lend and if were
lending there has to be a borrower  if youre talking about pension funds or life insurance
companies that are not leveraged investors its just not clear how we can do much to help them get
enthusiastic again about buying these securities  in the longer run the agenda of providing liquidity
to markets has to be joined with the reform agenda and figuring out what we can do to bring back
confidence in structured credit products by those types of investors  there are lots of
recommendations out therefrom the presidents working group and the financial stability
forumand sifma came out with a long study about restoring confidence in the securitization
markets  all of that unfortunately is going to take a while to implement and as with so many other
things these days were in uncharted territory  nobody knows for sure i think whether any of
those things even though they make sense will really be sufficient to bring those investors back
but as much as we try to come up with programs to address that it seems at the moment to be
beyond our power
mr dudley  may i add just one thing to that  its also not clear to me that the private
sector wont be clever enough to take these things and package them into securities that have the
equity and the leverage embedded in them and sell them to people who want to get high rates of
return  it might be a pretty interesting proposition
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  so are there any other constraints of a legal or regulatory nature on
participants in this market  is there anything that keeps any hedge fund in the world from buying
these things
mr dudley  yes were still working on
mr lacker  no no no not the programthe underlying securities
chairman bernanke  in general
mr lacker  in general  anyone could buy them right
mr dudley  the issuers have to basically conform with the tarp executive comp
restrictions
mr lacker  no no no  even not participating in the program  there are no
limitations on the investors who can participate for example in the market for assetbacked student
loans
mr dudley  well there is in this program in that were trying to figure out the right
way of restricting it to us investors
mr lacker  excuse me  the program doesnt exist yet  right now today is there
anything that restricts a hedge fund in london from buying an assetbacked security
mr dudley  i dont think sonot that im aware of
mr parkinson  no
mr lacker  the reason i askthe point that im makingis that you can reference
theories but at the end of the day its not just those predictions  its the whole range of things
about the theory  we havent in this seen many theories put on the table and the ones that have
beenthings like cashinthemarket pricingjust dont seem to match up well with the facts
theres a gigantic billions of dollars worth of investors out there who have the capability of buying
any of this stuff  in treasuries people are capable of arbitraging that ontherun and offtherun
thing  to explain this by appealing to some market segmentation seems really weak in this
environment  you know i welcome discussing theories under which these are pareto improving
programs but i havent seen one thats convincing yet
mr parkinson  i think it comes back to the point that bill made earlier  if youre a
hedge fund even libor plus 500 is still not a rich enough return to that hedge fund unless you can
borrow against those securities and leverage it up into a higher return  and until 18 months ago you
could have gotten the financing from deutsche bank the swiss banks or any of our fine us
banks but it doesnt appear at the moment that any of them are terribly interested in lending on a
secured basis even to the strongest of hedge funds  theyre simply hiding somewhere
mr dudley  i think were in disequilibrium  were in a disequilibrium in which the
dealers and banks that used to do this lending are in the process of dramatically shrinking their
balance sheets  goldman announced their fourth quarter today  they shrank their balance sheet by
18 percent from the end of their third quarter to the end of their fourth quarter  thats certainly not
any notion of equilibrium in the marketplace and i think that is whats causing the stresses in the
securities markets
mr lacker  are we preventing equilibration  i mean what are we doing  were in
the middle of an adjustment process it takes some time
mr dudley  the way i look at it president lacker is that the deleveraging process is
happening at a very rapid rate and that speed can cause quite a bit of damage to financial conditions
and therefore to the real economy  to the extent that we intervene and slow down the pace of that
deleveraging we can probably mitigate the degree of damage to financial conditions and to the real
economy  thats how i think about it
mr lacker  i look forward to seeing the model
mr fisher  were bridging
mr dudley  were bridgingexactly
chairman bernanke  president lacker i guess there are at least a couple of theories
you could have  one of them has to do with capital  if you think that certain types of intermediaries
have specialized knowledge and their ability to lend depends on their capital then there are
informational asymmetries in which clearly exogenous destruction of part of that capital is going to
affect equilibrium outcomes in the market  thats one possibility  the other class of models has to
do with liquidity where you have thick or thin markets depending on i trade if you trade and so
on and you have markets in which nobody is trading and so no one wants to be the first to enter  by
becoming a marketmaker you can perhaps generate more activity   i think there are some
interesting perspectives out there
mr lacker  im familiar with those models  we dont have time to discuss them now
chairman bernanke  no we should discuss them off line  president rosengren
mr rosengren  the loss of the securitization market is really important so i think this
facility is a very important innovation  my question is how important were the conduits to this
market and how confident are we that there will be structures to bring back the securitization
market  or are we basically bridging to these things going on bank balance sheets or other types of
financial intermediaries  how do you see this  i guess the question is from your perspective
what is this a bridge to
mr parkinson  i think the conduits were more important in some asset classes than
others  in credit cards for example the conduits were pretty important  but even there they were
important in recent years  i think they were important in recent years because spreads kept on
coming down and down and deterred the real money investors that traditionally invested in these
productsthey were no longer interested  yet the underwriters were able to keep the game going at
those low spreads by resorting to selling to conduits and securities lenders and those sorts of things
so over time if we could deal with some of the issues around confidence and ratings and the other
things that may be deterring the real money investors from entering the market there is a hope of
bringing them back and going back not to 2007 when it was conduits and that kind of stuff but to
say 2002 when you had real money investors buying these securities
mr dudley  also how you go through the cycle and what the loss experiences on these
securities are going to be are hugely important  if this is the worst recession in 30 years thats
going to be a very interesting data point in terms of what the credit losses on the securities are  if it
turns out that the credit losses are low and the securities are robust i think that will create more
demand for these securities over time  you have to weigh that of course in terms of what leverage
we are going to require financial institutions to carry and how leveraged they can be and where we
set those two standards will determine what goes through the capital markets versus what goes
through depository institutions
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  do we have in mind a limit as to how broadly we would make the credit
facility available
chairman bernanke  currently we have the class of securities  were looking at
consumer and smallbusiness abs
mr dudley  the treasury has basically committed 20 billion of tarp and we think
thats going to fund a program of roughly 200 billion of credit cards and auto loans and so on
mr hoenig  i ask that question because there are some very important industrial
companies that have been financing at fairly attractive rates and are now going to have to refinance
that at far less attractive rates  i think that will have every bit as significant an impact on the
economy as the mortgagebacked securities  so unless we think through how we limit this i think
theres a legitimate case for just about anything
mr dudley  well im sympathetic with your view that broader is better than narrower
because of all the boundary issues that one creates  i think we all are sympathetic with that
mr fisher  for example would you consider aaa industrialgrade credits
mr dudley  i think we would consider it  the real issue is the treasurys willingness
to use tarp money  we cant do any of this without the treasurys commitment so were
somewhat constrained in our ability to broaden it in the dimensions that we might want to broaden
it
mr parkinson  weve heard from practically everyone thats not within the class of
consumer abs and sba loans  we have heard from the commercial real estate people and from
the auto dealers about their floor plan loans we have heard from the banks that would like to get the
motorcycles and leases  but also corporate loansthe clo collateralized loan obligation market
also is shut down  so there is no question  again were in a hard place because if we werent
constrained in part by the tarp capital and our concerns about our balance sheet we would maybe
be able to have a much broader program in which we didnt have to make these kinds of decisions
but given that theres only 20 billion of tarp capital and were willing at this point to go only to
200 billion you cant really say well take all these different asset classes
mr hoenig  which makes my point  we really have to focus on fixing the intermediary
process in the united states  theres no limit to this  the refinancings coming due are huge
chairman bernanke  thats agreed and understood  again the limits include the
tarp capital our own willingness with respect to the balance sheet and so on  there really are
limits to what this can accomplish  president plosser
mr plosser  but in some sense just to follow up on this point the limits are what is
really important here because as long as we dont define some limits and we just say limited by
tarp capital well that doesnt really answer the question  as long as the markets act as if we or
someone else is going to step in and rescue them from any more lending arrangements they happen
to be facing the incentives for the intermediary system to repair itself or to gradually adjust are
going to be limited  im worried about the lack of definition about what constitutes a legitimate
market or instrument or firm that we wouldnt save
chairman bernanke  thats a good point and i think one thing that is a problem
now is the transition between administrations  well soon have a new treasury secretary and a
new administration  i think its very importantive discussed this with tim geithner and
othersthat as soon as possible we lay out a broad strategy  what are the components of our
strategy  what are we going to do going forward
mr plosser  and what are the limits to it
chairman bernanke  well implicitly what are the limits to it  how are we going
to approach the banking issue  what are we going to do about failing firms  how are we going to
try to address the securitization markets  i think the more clarity we can providei fully agree
with the critique that lurching is very bad and we need to provide an overview  there is a lot of
sympathy from the new treasury to do that and we just have to overcome the fact that were in a
transition at the moment  but i take that point  its a very good point
mr plosser  by the way mr chairman i want to thank you  i thought your exchange
of letters with senator dodd i guess it was over the automobile issues was well done
chairman bernanke  i dont think you read it though  laughter
mr plosser  excuse me i read about it
chairman bernanke  other questions for bill
mr lacker  i just want to raise two things that worry me  one is that when these
programs are small you subsidize x percent of the credit market  the other 1 minus x percent the
effect on their rate of return their borrowing costs probably is small  but when x gets neari
dont know where it is now or  then our subsidization is raising borrowing costs for everyone
who doesnt get money
chairman bernanke  its not clear  the commercial paper market might be a
counterexample to that
mr lacker  there are some models in which that is the case  its not obvious how we
rule them out  the second thing isi dont know how you evaluate thisyou must be thinking
whether this means that in every moderatesized recession henceforth well view the federal
reserves best policy as extending
chairman bernanke  its not a moderate recession and its not a normal financial
downturn
mr lacker  right  every recession of the size weve now seen 3 of in the last 50 years
so every recession of that size
chairman bernanke  you have to have a deep recession and a financial crisis
thats pretty unusual  twice a century or once a century so far
mr dudley  ill give you an examplethe vix has never been this elevated this long
since the great depression
mr lacker  so youre saying that youre not concerned about setting up expectations
for the next recession
chairman bernanke  certainly im concerned  im very concerned  but im also
concerned about getting through this recession  so those are the tradeoffs
mr lacker  okay
chairman bernanke  other questions about the program  if not let me just tell you
that im going to be doing a call with the press at 315 in the special library  any fomc member
who has nothing else to do and would like to join is welcome  michelle has given your public
affairs people the phone number so that they can listen in and well see how that goes  the next
meeting is tuesdaywednesday january 2728  the meeting is adjourned  thank you
end of meeting
