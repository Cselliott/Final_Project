september 22afternoon session
 
chairman bernanke good afternoon 
mr kohn mr chairman 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr kohn may i interrupt 
chairman bernanke please 
mr kohn id like to congratulate you on your reappointment  i think youve provided critical leadership to the committee through these past sometimes difficult years  im glad the president recognized that you are the best person for the future and im sure the senate will agree very shortly so congratulations  applause 
chairman bernanke and many thanks to the committee for the collegial work and discussions weve had through a very difficult period  i appreciate how much weve all pulled together and dealt with some of these enormous problems 
i need a motion to close the board meeting 
mr kohn so moved 
chairman bernanke let me first welcome jim lyon to the table  jim will be sitting in gary sterns spot  gary retired as you know two weeks ago and we will have a luncheon tomorrow after the meeting to honor gary 
the first item on the agenda is financial developments open market operations and system credit facilities  well start with a briefing from the desk by brian sack  well have a qa after that and then well follow that with some additional staff briefings  brian 
mr sack1 footnote 1 the materials used by mr sack are appended to this transcript appendix 1 end footnote 1   thank you mr chairman prices on a broad range of risky assets continued to rise over the intermeeting period fueled by an improving economic outlook and the low level of financing rates arising from the current stance of monetary policy broad equity indexes shown in the upper left panel rose more than 7 percent on balance adding to the sizable recovery since the end of the first quarter  corporate bond spreads the upper right edged down further leaving them dramatically improved from their levels earlier in the year 
the gains over the past six months owe primarily to a more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook and a perception that the downside risks to growth have diminished  indeed as captured in our primary dealer survey in the middle left panel the upward revision in the expected path of gdp growth from earlier in the year has been substantial in addition respondents also indicated that the downside risks around the expected growth path diminished notably over this period  this shift has reduced the amount of uncertainty that investors see in risky asset prices as indicated by the relatively low levels of implied volatility on equities shown to the right 
the gains in asset prices have been so dramatic that market observers have begun to wonder whether the markets have become too frothy with some pointing to the extensive liquidity provided by the federal reserve as a contributing factor  by many metrics however asset valuations do not look too extended  the board staffs measure of the equity premium shown in the bottom left panel is still high by historical standards likewise by many measures corporate yield spreads still look relatively high taking into account the outlook for defaults  as shown in the bottom  right expected corporate defaults have fallen substantially since earlier in the year which likely explains a considerable portion of the narrowing of corporate yield spreads 
overall risky asset prices have come a long way over the past six months but so has the economic environment that they reflect 
in contrast to the more accommodative conditions in financial markets banks continued to restrict credit to private borrowers  as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2 the volume of private loans at commercial banks the dark blue line has declined sharply this decline has not been driven by a lack of available funds as deposits the orange line have risen sharply and other sources of funding have become more readily available  in fact banks have been accumulating treasury and agency securities the light blue line over this period however they have less appetite for adding credit risk to their portfolios as they continue to repair their balance sheets and face additional loan writedowns going forward 
part of the decline in bank credit also reflects weaker demand  the business sector as a whole has little need to raise new funds and net borrowing by the sector has been negative in recent months  in addition firms with access to the market have shifted towards corporate bonds as a source of financing  this shift can be seen in the amount of highyield debt that has been issued since the first quarter the upper right panel the pattern for consumer credit is similar in some regards  overall consumer credit is contracting sharply despite the issuance of a decent volume of consumerrelated abs as shown in the middle left panel abs issuance reached 38 billion in the third quarter near its pace from the previous quarter 
activity in the abs market has been supported to a great extent by the talf with nearly all of the abs deals in the third quarter brought to the market through the talf however there are signs that dependence on the talf is beginning to wane  most notably even though most issuance is talfeligible the amount of that issuance that is actually financed through the facility has been declining a sign that private credit markets have improved enough to make talf financing relatively expensive for some borrowers  at the september subscription for example only 6 billion of the nearly 17 billion of abs issued ended up being financed through the talf 
the better financing conditions and the greater willingness of investors to take risk have led to a further decline in abs spreads shown in the middle right panel  spreads for aaarated consumer abs have returned to levels not seen since the middle of last year 
spreads also narrowed on outstanding cmbs the bottom left despite the ongoing worsening in the outlook for the commercial real estate sector  the improvement in cmbs has been very much tied to government support programs as the ppip and the talf have led market participants to anticipate greater demand for these assets  the nine ppip funds are in the process of raising capital and should begin purchases of assets later this year and the talf has now included three subscriptions covering legacy cmbs assets financing over 4 billion of purchases  in addition a recently announced change by treasury to the tax treatment of cmbs workouts seemed to provide a further boost to their prices  unfortunately as shown to the right issuance of new cmbs remains completely shut down and the talf has yet to fund any newissue cmbs  thus the commercial real estate sector faces a very difficult credit environment going forward 
despite the broad increase in risky asset prices treasury yields moved lower over the intermeeting period  as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 3 treasury coupon yields declined 15 to 30 basis points on net  the most important sources of the decline in longerterm rates according to our dealer survey were a decline in inflation expectations a reduction in upside inflation risks and strong demand from foreign official institutions consistent with those responses forward breakeven inflation rates shown to the right moved down over the intermeeting period  investors also see less interest rate risk as suggested by the implied volatility measures shown in the middle left panel which have fallen notably from their elevated levels over the summer  the perceived reduction in upside inflation risk and the decline in interest rate volatility may have contributed to a narrowing of the term premium embedded in longerterm yields   
investors also apparently marked down the expected path of monetary policy as the substantial slack in the economy and other favorable inflation news supported the view that the fed would remain on hold for an extended period  as shown in the middle right panel futures prices now suggest a later start to policy tightening  that brings the market pricing closer to the results from our dealer survey  as shown in the bottom left most survey respondents do not expect the tightening to begin until the third quarter of 2010 or later 
the fomcs decision to taper its purchases of treasury securities announced at the last fomc meeting was well received by market participants  this approach is widely seen by investors as a prudent exit strategy and the announcement did not prompt any response in treasury yields  at present the desk has completed 289 billion of purchases and it plans to wind down its remaining purchases over the next five weeks as shown in the bottom right panel while still reaching a cumulative purchase total of 300 billion 
the exit from the agency debt and mbs purchase programs could prove more challenging however as shown in the upper left panel of the next exhibit optionadjusted mbs spreads over treasury yields remain unusually tight  in our view federal reserve purchases have had a substantial effect on mbs rates partly accounting for this low level of spreads market participants seem to agree with that assessment  as shown to the right the responses to our dealer survey indicate that the purchase programs are seen as pushing down the currentcoupon mbs rate by a significant amount with an average response of about 60 basis points  however it is worth noting that only a subset of respondents chose to provide such estimates and the responses vary over a wide range 
given these effects some observers are concerned that the mbs rate will rise sharply as the feds purchases come to an end  the extent of these concerns should depend on ones views about how the purchase programs affect the markets  as we have highlighted in recent memos the effect on market interest rates could come primarily through the stock of assets purchased consistent with a portfolio balance effect under that perspective even an abrupt end of the purchase program would not create market difficulties as the stock of assets held outside the fed would not change discretely however we have also highlighted the possibility that the flow of purchases could have some effect on rates due to various market imperfections  in that case one might be concerned about how the market would adjust to a sharp dropoff in asset purchases by the fed 
to gauge the scope of these different effects we asked the respondents to our dealer survey about their views on how the feds asset purchases affect the market  the answers did not exactly settle the issue  in rough terms about onethird of the respondents said that the effects arise primarily through stock effects onethird said primarily through flow effects and onethird said through both  laughter moreover in quantifying the effects of the purchase programs most respondents saw the effects identified in the upper right panel as either partly or fully diminishing over the sixmonth period after purchases end consistent with the presence of some flow effects 
given the responses from the survey it may be prudent for the fomc to take an exit approach that is robust to the possibility of both stock and flow effects  this consideration was the basis for the recommendation that the staff made at the last fomc meeting to taper the pace of purchases gradually as the programs come to an end for this meeting we provided a memo with more details about potential paths for the purchases of mbs and agency debt 
the strategy highlighted in the memo is to taper mbs purchases beginning soon after the current fomc meeting with the intention of finishing the purchases by the end of the first quarter one potential path under this strategy is shown by the light blue line in the middle left panel  this approach would give the market time to adjust to the declining presence of the fed and to allow new purchasers of mbs to crowd in and replace the fed which might smooth any interest rate response associated with that process another potential benefit is that it would allow the desk to start letting up on the gas pedal immediately which could help to address any strains on market functioning arising from our current pace of purchases although our impression is that market liquidity over the past month or two has been decent even at our current rate of purchases 
the fomc could consider an even longer tapering period that lasts through the second quarter as shown by the red line however this would involve a steeper drop in purchases today which would risk prompting some backup in mortgage rates in the nearterm  the desk does not believe that the longer tapering period is needed for facilitating the market adjustment or for ensuring market liquidity  hence any decision to move in this direction should be based on other considerations such as the optimal amount and timing of the stimulus that policymakers desire 
the memo also made a recommendation for tapering agency debt purchases  the green line in the panel to the right shows that the pace of agency purchases would have to pick up considerably to reach the 200 billion limit by yearend  the current pace of purchases is already causing some strain on market functioning so such an increase is not advised an extension of the program through the first quarter would allow the desk to get to the 200 billion limit the red line though the amount of tapering would be limited under that approach  alternatively the desk could aim to reach 175 billion of purchases through the first quarter which would allow a decent amount of tapering the blue line  one possibility is to allow the purchases to end up somewhere between 175 and 200 billion depending on how market conditions evolve 
the market effects of an announcement on tapering will also depend on whether market participants make any inference about changes to the total size of the programs  in particular there is some risk that the announcement of a slowdown in the pace of purchases could be interpreted as a sign that the total size of the program is being reduced this risk may be particularly acute when the program size provides flexibility in that direction as is currently the case with the up to language  when the tapering of treasury purchases was announced the fomc decided to drop the up to portion of the targeted amount which provided the markets with clarity about the total size of the program and avoided this risk 
as shown in the bottom panels our dealer survey suggests that market participants expect the federal reserve to reach the full 125 trillion limit for mbs purchases that view is consistent with what the desk has heard in conversations with a broad set of traders and market analysts  the survey also indicates that agency debt purchases are expected to reach the full 200 billion limit although discussions with traders indicate that this view is not held as uniformly or with as much conviction in both cases respondents expected purchases to continue into the first quarter 
the ongoing purchases of securities have now begun to outpace the decline in balances at the feds liquidity facilities as shown in the upper left panel on the last page causing the size of the feds total balance sheet to drift higher  we expect this trend to continue with the balance sheet projected to grow from its current level of 21 trillion to a peak of 24 trillion by june 2010  this process will continue to add reserves to the banking system  in addition the drawdown of the treasurys sfp balances from 200 billion to 15 billion over the next six weeks will boost the amount of reserves even further  overall based on these developments the level of excess reserves is likely to increase from its average of around 850 billion in the current maintenance period to nearly 12 trillion by the end of the year 
i will conclude my briefing by describing recent developments in shortterm funding markets and the associated effects on lending through our shorterterm liquidity facilities  the rates at which some of the largest financial institutions can obtain unsecured credit have fallen impressively as indicated by the liborois spreads shown in the upper right panel the spread for the threemonth maturity point has dropped all the way to 12 basis pointsa level that was seen as normal ahead of the financial crisis this improvement reflects greater confidence in the soundness of the financial system a greater willingness to extend credit and a gradual reduction in borrowers demand for funds  for similar reasons the market for borrowing by nonfinancial firms has also improved as shown in the middle left by the tight spreads on commercial paper  
however while some firms face few funding constraints others reportedly have much less access to the market  indeed even in the libor panel there remains some degree of tiering in the pricing of credit across borrowers and anecdotal evidence suggests that such tiering is much more extensive for financial firms outside the libor panel 
in terms of secured financing the repo market is generally functioning well  repo volumes have stabilized after the steep decline that began late last year and bidasked spreads on many types of transactions have improved considerably from the high levels reached during the crisis  however there is now much more differentiation across types of collateral  as shown in the middle right panel haircuts in the repo market widened sharply for lowerquality collateral during the crisis and have remained very disperse  this type of differentiation is expected to persist to some degree 
overall the financial crisis has caused some lasting changes to the way shortterm funding markets operate with greater differentiation across both borrowers and types of collateral nevertheless market participants seem to have adjusted to these changes and access to shortterm funding has been improving for many borrowers 
this improvement has been sufficient to reduce the usage of the feds liquidity facilities by market participants as most facilities were priced to be attractive during periods of financial stress but uneconomical during normal periods  the amount of credit provided by these facilities shown in the bottom left has shrunk dramatically from over 15 trillion early this year to less than 350 billion todaya decline that has spanned all of the facilities  this decline indicates that the automatic exit strategy that was built into the design of these facilities has worked well 
it is important to note however that these volumes might not be on a simple glide path to zero the table to the right shows the number of firms that remain in the facilities as well as the number of borrowers that have continuously relied on the facilities since june  the fed is likely to face an adverse selection problem in which firms with limited outside financing options prove the most challenging to push out of the facilities federal reserve staff has begun to engage those firms remaining in each facility in discussions about their plans for exiting the program in order to ensure the least disruptive transition from these facilities once they expire 
that concludes my prepared remarks 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  questions for brian governor tarullo  
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  brian as you were discussing panels 27 and 28 you made reference to some lasting changes in some of the credit markets  can you specify a bit which you expect to be lasting and which you expect to continue to improve 
mr sack i can theres a lot of focus on the liborois spread which seems to give the impression that the market has completely returned to previous practices  i wanted to present some evidence suggesting that thats not the case but rather that the market does look different today from the way it looked several years ago  in particular as i said in the remarks theres just much more differentiation across types of collateral and to some degree across types of borrowers those are lasting changes not only in that they have persisted to today but also in that we expect them to persist at least to some degree indefinitely as the market moves towards more reasonable pricing and a more reasonable structure going forward  it makes sense  there certainly should be a good deal of differentiation across different types of collateral  for example some of the collateral listed in this chart is riskierits harder to put a price on it so you dont know the value of the collateral so certainly the idea that the market would require a haircut for that kind of collateral seems reasonable that was the point we see those changes as likely to persist to some degree at least going forward 
mr tarullo theyre not so much structural changes thoughyoure anticipating that as things continue to normalize there wont be some sort of a reversion to the way things were before the crisis 
mr sack correct but i think theres a possibility that well see structural changes as well for example a working group has been formed to look at the triparty repo market and some of the credit issues that arose in that market during the crisis in the end depending on what the solutions are structural change could also affect pricing in these markets 
mr tarullo okay thanks 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans brian my question is just out of curiosity about something ive heard you say a couple of times  why do dealers have different opinions on the feds likely followthrough on our purchases of agency mbs versus the agency debt i have read commentaries and weve taken questions on whether or not well follow through on mbs but i havent heard the same about the agency debt   
mr sack i think theres less conviction that well follow through to the full limit on the agencies and thats primarily because theres a recognition by market participants that the pace of purchases is causing some strain in the market  and its also because the pace of purchases is not sufficient to get us to the 200 billion limit by the end of the year  you can see that in chart 22wed need a pretty sharp increase in the pace of purchases to get to the mandated total  so i think the inference that investors have drawn is that the committee is less committed to getting to that total on the agency debt side than it is on the mbs side 
chairman bernanke president hoenig 
mr hoenig id like to follow up on that brian and anticipate perhaps a bit of tomorrows discussion  looking at these spreads and where the market is heading what is the likely reaction to our saying that instead of going to 1 trillion we are going to 1 trillion for the mbs purchases and were going to taper it so we end this at the end of the year anticipating that the economy is recovering and therefore we have to begin to think about our exit strategy  i know a bit of uncertainty about this may be out there and id like to get your sense of how much turmoil was circulating around that possibility and what the effect would be 
mr sack at this point i think that outcome would likely prompt some backup in mbs rates its difficult to gauge the magnitude of that increase but it wouldnt be surprising if it were on the order of say 15 to 30 basis points something like that  in the past the staff has looked at a variety of evidence and used rules of thumb suggesting that something like 100 billion of a surprisein any purchase programcould be worth something like 6 to 10 basis points on tenyear yields so that estimate would be consistent with those metrics  i think its important to realize that market participants see a sizable effect today  they seem to have a pretty strong conviction that the program will go all the way to 125 trillion  so those two things mean that that announcement would be a surprise 
mr hoenig given those basis points and given the fact that you would have then time following that are we talking about a bad thing necessarily given where the market is and that were in the process of shifting away from our having such a dominant role in other words do you think that the action would be disruptive to the economy more broadly in terms of its effect on the market  now if it lasted that would be one thing but if it were temporary that would be another thing given that the market may begin to work again 
mr sack i think it wouldnt necessarily be disruptive to the market at least in any sustained sense obviously it would be a surprise upon announcement  there would be some adjustment but presumably the market would reprice and begin to function just fine  i think the broader question of whether its a good thing is an issue for the fomc  it would mean a higher cost of housing and obviously the associated effects on the strength of the economy 
mr hoenig fair enough thank you very much 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley i just want to amplify on brians answer  first i think the effect would be 15 to 30 basis points at a minimum because by the end of this week were going to have done about 895 billion of agency mbs purchases so to cap it at a trillion means you are only doing 105 billion as opposed to 355 billion  so its a pretty sizable discrete difference second the market would take it as an independent signal about how concerned or unconcerned the fed was with the economic outlook  they probably would also pull forward the timing of fed tightening  so thered probably be a separate channel in terms of the effects on yields i think brians 15 to 30 basis points is conservative if you add those two effects together 
chairman bernanke  how does that match up the dealers thoughtwhat was it about 50 or 60 basis points from the end of the program 
mr sack they see the effect today as 60 basis points 
vice chairman dudley youre pretty close to ending it if you only have 105 billion to go 
chairman bernanke okay 
mr lacker mr chairman 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker are you talking about spreads or yields and how would it affect the treasury market 
mr sack i was talking about yields the dealer survey question is about yields  its true that we look at spreads as indicated in the chart in the briefing  we look at spreads as a useful measure to look for those effects but i think ultimately we care about the effects on yields so we were careful to phrase the dealer question to be about yields and not spreads  i think you would assume some of that effect passes through to treasuries but obviously not one for one 
mr lacker but wouldnt the treasury view this as the treasury marketdamp the effect on yields right  i mean if the spreads dont move as much 
mr sack were talking about an effect on mbs yields  so whether its 15 to 30 basis points or up to 60 basis points were talking about the effect on mbs rates  i would expect some portion of that to pass through to treasury yields and to yields more broadly 
chairman bernanke other questions  let me just recognize you president bullard but lets not get completely into the debate at this point  laughter were still in qa mode  president bullard 
mr bullard i just want to understand exhibit 4 and number 19 the mbs optionadjusted spread you cited this figure as evidence that there was an effect on the purchase program and i just want to understand how we should think of this  if you look at the left part of the graphfrom august 2000 to august 2003that would be a period of recession and very slow economic growth following the recession and the spread fell maybe 80 basis points just eyeballing it in the current episode youve got a much more severe recession and the spread fell maybe 100 basis points  there was no assetpurchase program in the earlier period and if we control for recession effects maybe there wouldnt be very big effects from the assetpurchase program or do we not want to interpret it that way 
mr sack when we modeled mbs spreadsand weve used a variety of models some of them included other credit spreads  there does seem to be some comovement between mbs spreads and other credit spreads  i think that was probably the case in that earlier period and obviously we see this pattern of widening into the crisis and then improving in other markets as well  i think the difference is that the improvement in the mbs spread has been so sharp and has corresponded so strongly with the purchase programs that we dont think this narrowing just reflects some improvement in credit and some cyclical effect  we think it goes well beyond that 
having said that i would like to say it is hard to determine how far beyond some sustainable level the spreads are  here im showing a measure relative to treasuries  this spread is negative that looks anomalous by historical standards so you could look at this chart and eyeball it and say well maybe the spread is 50 basis points below whats sustainable  but if we measure it relative to swap rates it doesnt look quite as extreme  i would say relative to swap rates it looks like mbs are maybe 25 basis points beyond fundamentals 
our general conclusion is that we believe the purchases have had a very large effect on the spreads starting from a disrupted market i think its very fair to conclude that the purchases have collapsed those spreads more than 100 basis points  the harder question is have they collapsed them to normal or through normal and if through normal how far based on the range of models were estimating trying to answer this question something like 25 to 50 basis points looks like a reasonable guess 
chairman bernanke a twohander president lacker 
mr lacker no it was a onehander mr chairman  
chairman bernanke onehander okay laughter well go onehander to president fisher 
mr fisher well if you want to continue on the mortgagebacked securities mine is on another subject so perhaps president lacker would like to go   
chairman bernanke im sorry  okay president plosser yes 
mr plosser twohander 
chairman bernanke twohander okay 
mr plosser id like to go back to this estimate of the effects of cutting back purchases from 1 trillion to 1 trillion im looking at exhibit 4 chart 20  the effect on yields is somewherelets just take a modal numberbetween 50 and 75 basis points  i thought the argument had been that it is the stock that matters not flow so much  if we cut from 1 trillion to 1 trillion thats onefifth of the total stock  if you do a backoftheenvelope calculation divide 75 basis points by fivethat would suggest somewhere between 10 and 15 basis points not somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points  so im not quite sure i understand the argument that by cutting the program by onefifth were going to take away as much as half or threequarters of the basis point cut that the dealers seem to think there has been could you clarify that for me 
mr sack well there is a range of interpretations  lets say we assume half the effect comes through stock and half the effect comes through flow  in this case if the total effect is 50 to 75 that means say we have 35 and 35  youre right about the stock effect not changing dramatically  the expected stock effect is shifting but if we take your onefifth were talking maybe 10 basis points max  but of course the flow effect is going to diminish as well 
when we look at these responses 50 to 75 basis points and at how these respondents answered about how the effects would evolve going forward they essentially almost uniformly assume that the effect would diminish from now to six months after the conclusion of the purchases so implicitly they were putting a lot of weight on flow effects in those responses  we didnt push too hard on that because its a small number of responses  we didnt really dig into it very much and follow up with them on why they had so much reversal  but i think when we look at the dealer survey as a whole it suggests that flow effects are a big part of this 
chairman bernanke would you like to finish 
mr sack no thats okay 
chairman bernanke president fisher 
mr fisher mr chairman this is sort of a statement disguised as a question but i would still like to get your reaction brian it has nothing to do with mortgagebacked securities which i realize is the focus of a lot of this meeting  it goes back to your first graph on equity prices we have hadgoing back to 1923 192415 recessions before the current one  according to the data if my memory serves correctly from the trough of the equity market as measured by the sp 500 or its equivalent to when we emerge from recession the average rally has been about 22 percent  looking at chart 1 if you assume that we exited the recession in july roughly we have had the most significant equity market rally in history this even outperforms 1929 to 1933 
i am continually troubled by the issue of topline versus margin enhancement and bottomline growth  i ask this question because i think it is very important  we make almost a linear assumption in our baseline case of pretty positive equity market numbers going forward after having had what is historically speaking the greatest stock market rally coming out of a recession in history that is around 48 percent  now from your standpoint as a market operator or as someone who is more attuned to the markets than certainly i am and i think the rest of us are can you continue this process without topline growth im just curious as to what your concerns are if you have them because again the baseline growth model that we have factors in some pretty healthy equity market numbers going forward  so im just curious from a desk standpoint what your feelings are about this  and i realize this is guessworkbut still 
mr sack well i think weve had a very sharp rally reflecting the size of the revision to the economic outlook and the very substantial shift in the perceived risks around that outlook  so yes it is big by historical standards but there is a very extreme update to the outlook among market participants  the question is going forward can you sustain that pace  the answer is  definitely no going forward the equity market gains are going to be governed by changes in earnings revenue and by changes in the valuation or the equity premium that was shown in the chart on the earnings revenue side earnings have been good but a lot of that good news has come from costcutting  we dont have a lot of topline gdp growth so it will be hard to produce a robust enough earnings environment given the gdp forecast for that to be the engine of ongoing substantial equity market gains  i think a bigger question is the equity premium that i showed in the bottom left panel  there we have scope for further narrowing so that could be one source of ongoing gains but as you can see weve already narrowed a good amount so even there were kind of losing capacity 
but keep in mind that were going up very rapidly  we had a 7 percent gain this intermeeting period and for a while i was describing that as underperformance relative to the previous intermeeting periods  so i think of course this can level out  my main point was not that we should expect to sustain these increases but that these increases have not necessarily set us up for some kind of a reversal because the increases have not pushed valuations beyond what looked reasonable under some models  
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker thank you when you announce individual auctions that you hold to buy treasuries or mbs or agency debt you dont announce the amount do you 
mr sack thats correct 
mr lacker with regard to the total program we talked about the value of clarity  i was wondering why you dont announce the amounts when you do individual auctions especially if theres a flow effect 
mr sack we try to retain some flexibility for varying the flow of purchases in response to market conditions and in response to the kinds of offers that we receive  thats the main answer  i think it would be problematic if the market had no sense of what our pace of purchases was going to be or what kind of target we were trying to get to  but they know all of that so we just afford ourselves some ability to vary over time in response to market conditions 
we do exercise discretion in terms of how much to push the markets on any given day especially in the mbs program and in the agency debt program  we will have a target for purchasing currently around 25 billion a week for mbs but what we actually realize in a given week depends on the market conditions that we see and how much we seem able to buy without causing problems in market functioning  so the main answer is that we dont commit to a schedule of purchase amounts because we want to retain that flexibility 
mr lacker okay it sounds like the value of flexibility to you exceeds the value that providing clarity to market participants on that day would provide 
i have another question if i could mr chairman  brian mentioned strains in the agency debt market  i would be interested in learning a little more about sort of what observationally that looks like 
mr sack first let me just clarify one thing  we dont announce in advance paths for the size of mbs purchases when we do treasury operations we do announce the size the day before the operation is conducted 
mr lacker for treasuries 
mr sack but we dont precommit to the sizethats what i meant  in the agency market a lot of the feedback is anecdotal  we look at trading volumes we look at bidasked spreads but we also rely a lot on discussions with market participants  and we see a number of things for example for a time we werent buying ontherun issues  we were only buying offtherun issues and what we saw was actually a reverse ontherun premium develop in the sense that the ontherun yields were actually higher than all of the offtherun yields   
so we certainly look at this market and say well our purchases are really pushing prices a lot they are taking a lot of the floating supply in the market  and we hear back from dealers that they are affecting dealers willingness to short issues out of fear that there is not enough floating supply to cover those positions  so we look at a variety of evidence 
this isnt too controversial we are very big in that market  i think in the last briefing i indicated that our purchases were something like ten times the net issuance in the agency sector that we expected over the program  so we are very big relative to issuance and the size of that market and its quite clear that thats causing some problems for marketing functioning 
mr lacker do you think the market is better off with our intervention do you think were accomplishing other things that outweigh the detrimental effect of these strains 
mr sack for the treasury purchases and the mbs purchases i would say the answer is yes i think weve had a substantial effect on market interest rates  assuming your objective was to lower market interest rates and simulate economic activity i think those programs have been very successful its less clear how the agency debt purchase program has led to those effects obviously there are indirect channels through affecting the agencies ability to finance themselves and maybe their purchases of mortgages  but theyre not expanding their balance sheets so i would say the benefits of that program are less clear to me 
chairman bernanke  any other questions for brian no response okay seeing none im going to turn to bill english who is going to give the first of three briefings on the balance sheet reserve management and associated issues and then well take questions for all three briefings at the same time  bill 
mr english2 footnote 2 the materials used by mr english are appended to this transcript appendix 2 end footnote 2   thank you very much  ill be referring to the handout fomc 
briefing on the implications of higher reserve balances  as shown in the top left 
panel of your first exhibit the aggregate stock of reserve balances has increased from
 about 20 billion prior to the onset of the financial crisis to about 850 billion recently and it is projected to peak at about 12 trillion during the first half of next year before gradually trending lower this very high level of reserves raises two potential concerns noted to the right  first high levels of reserve balances could by increasing banks assets put downward pressure on their regulatory leverage ratios leading them to pull back further from lending or cut purchases of securities with adverse consequences for the economy  second and conversely as the economy improves and banks become more comfortable with their capital and liquidity positions they could try to take steps to reduce their reserve balances  because the banking system as a whole cannot reduce reserve balances all that much banks efforts to do so could put downward pressure on some interest rates and boost bank lending the result could be an increase in monetary stimulus at a time when the economy may already be expanding briskly and inflation could be at or above its desired level 
as noted in the middle left panel the first of these concerns was the subject of a staff memorandum and briefing at your june meeting  the staffs assessment at that time was that banks appeared to have sufficient capital to absorb the projected increase in reserve balances without putting undue pressure on their leverage ratios since that time the staff has marked down substantially the anticipated increase in reserve balances reflecting unexpectedly large paydowns of federal reserve lending programs a smaller assumed size of the talf program and the more gradual pace of mbs purchases now projected this revision reinforces the results presented by the staff in june but i should note that we do not know how large a capital buffer individual banking organizations want to maintain over regulatory norms so its possible that elevated levels of reserves could yet constrain some banks activities   
as noted to the right to obtain further information on the second concern staff consulted four banking organizations over the intermeeting period including two large us commercial banks one key processing bank and one large us branch of a foreign banking organization these four institutions currently account for 35 percent of aggregate reserve balances and 17 percent of total bank credit  of course this is a small sample and the institutions are not typical of the broader banking universe these firms were chosen because they represent a range of institution types and because their reserve balances are very high suggesting that their plans could shed considerable light on the demand for reserve balances going forward the consultations covered three broad areas of balance sheet management  the reasons for the firms current high reserve balances their possible responses to further increases in reserve balances and their intentions regarding an eventual return to lower levels of balances 
the most notable reasons the banking organizations provided for their own elevated balances are listed in the bottom left panel  all of the institutions pointed to substantial inflows of funds last fall following the failure of lehman brothers and the strains in the money market mutual fund sector  three institutions also indicated that riskadjusted returns on alternative assets were not attractive and that loan demand has been weak in addition the large commercial banks noted a desire to hold high balances as a liquidity buffer against the possibility that conditions in funding markets might deteriorate again   
as noted to the right we next asked how the institutions might respond to a further inflow of reserve balances to their institutions  the large commercial banks indicated that their balances could rise somewhat further before they would take actions to reduce them  by contrast the processing bank and the foreign branch both reported that they would take steps to offset any addition to their reserve balances the institutions generally reported that the actions they would take to offset an increase in reserves would include running off some managed liabilities and purchasing safe short and intermediateterm securities  the banking organizations pointed specifically to treasury and agency obligations and other sovereign and sovereignguaranteed securities such as fdicguaranteed bank bonds  none of the banks suggested that they would increase their lending to reduce reserve balances in this situation   
the top left panel of your next exhibit summarizes the four banking organizations plans for reducing their reserve balances over time  each firm expected that these reductions would leave the desired level of balances well above precrisis levels reflecting particularly for the processing bank and the foreign branch the impact of the payment of interest on reserves and for the two large commercial banks a general increase in concern about access to liquidity during periods of stress 
the four institutions suggested very different timing for their anticipated reductions in reserve balances the processing bank noted that it had already begun trimming its balances and it planned to complete its adjustment by the end of the year one of the two large commercial banks planned to make its adjustment next year and the other in 2011 the foreign branch suggested that there likely could be no significant reduction in its reserve holdings until the federal reserve began cutting the aggregate supply of reserves it explained that its balances were primarily determined by volatile flows of shortterm funds from its customers and it had little ability to influence such flows without disrupting existing customer relationships   
when they felt the time had come to begin reducing their reserve holdings the banking organizations planned to make adjustments to both the asset and liability sides of their balance sheets as listed to the right  on the liability side they planned to pay down their borrowings in wholesale funding markets and allow some large time deposits to run off  on the asset side they would increase lending in interbank and other wholesale markets and increase purchases of safe short and intermediateterm securities  only one of the institutions said that it might ease its credit terms to boost lending and none reported an intention to ease credit standards     
as noted in the middle left panel there is some tension between our projected increases in reserve balances and the banks stated expectation that their demand for such holdings will fall over coming years  individual banks are likely to take actions to reduce their reserves but as i noted earlier they cannot in aggregate reduce the stock of reserve balances all that much  thus the main result of the banks efforts is likely to be changes in the returns on various assets and liabilities that leave the banking sector content to hold the existing stock of reserve balances  in particular rates on shorterterm funding instruments are likely to fall relative to the rate paid on reserve balances while yields on securities that are viewed as relatively close substitutes for reservesparticularly short and intermediateterm treasury and agency securitiesshould decline somewhat from their already low levels  these changes will then be arbitraged into the yields on other assets as well  by contrast the consultations suggest that banks are unlikely to ease their lending standards significantly in order to boost loan growth  nonetheless as the economy recovers the demand for loans from creditworthy firms and households will presumably pick up and risk spreads may well narrow as the outlook improves  the result is likely to be a recovery and expansion in loans at banks that largely stems from factors other than reductions in desired reserves holdings   
as noted to the right these potential effects of very high reserve balances are the expected consequences of quantitative easing  however the size of such effects on interest rates and the aggregate economy is quite uncertain  evidence from the japanese experience suggests that they may be fairly small  rates on interbank deposits and shortterm securities are already quite lowindeed bill rates are below the rate paid on reserve balancesand so are not likely to fall all that much further given that we are at present operating so close to the zero bound  moreover these effects may emerge only gradually as institutions decide on a bankbybank basis to reduce their reserves demand  in addition some banks actions may be constrained by capital concerns  for these reasons in the staff forecast the effects of elevated reserve balances are implicitly assumed to be quite small though i should note that in the staff forecast the direct effects of the federal reserves purchases of treasury agency and agency mortgagebacked securities on longterm yields are estimated to be large 
to provide some background for the committee regarding the possible macroeconomic impact of elevated reserve balances going forward my colleagues in research and statistics and i constructed an alternative scenario using the frbus model we started by assuming that the effects of elevated reserve balances on short and intermediateterm interest rates are quite largemuch larger than we believe is likely to be the caseand occur at the start of 2010  in particular we assume a decline of 50 basis points relative to the baseline in interest rates at maturities of one to five years accompanied by a downtick in longerterm interest rates a modest decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a small rise in stock prices  importantly however we assume that banks make no changes to their lending standards and terms  the lower interest rates boost household spending on durables business spending on equipment and software and housing investment through mortgage rates primarily on arms while the lower value of the dollar raises net exports adding up the pieces as shown in the bottom left panel the effect is to increase gdp growth by about 03 percentage point in 2010 and 04 percentage point in 2011 cut the unemployment rate by 03 percentage point by the end of 2011 and raise inflation just a bit  while these effects which we believe are likely a significant overstatement are not negligible they do not greatly change the general contour of the staff forecast 
of course it is possible that this assessment of the effects of very high reserve balances is wrongwere in a new worldand that the result will be a larger dose of monetary stimulus next year as noted in the bottom right panel  for example banks may prove far more willing to ease credit standards and terms than suggested by our consultations  however some fomc participants may see additional stimulus as potentially beneficial  in the staff forecast the economic recovery is gradual unemployment remains high through 2011 and inflation remains low  thus some additional stimulus might be helpful in fostering economic conditions that are more consistent with your dual objectives  on the other hand very high reserve balances could undercut confidence in the federal reserves ability to maintain price stability contributing to higher expected and actual inflation  if very high reserve balances provide undesired stimulus or appear to be significantly boosting inflation expectations then the committee could choose to tighten policy sooner or more rapidly than it would have otherwise  jim clouse will now update you on the work being done to prepare the tools that might be employed in doing so   
mr clouse thanks bill the staff has continued to develop reserve management toolsincluding term reverse rps a term deposit facility and reserve collateral accounts that along with adjustments to the interest rate on excess reserves should allow the committee to raise the federal funds rate when it wishes to do so   
as discussed at the august meeting the desk could drain reserves by conducting term reverse rps with primary dealers or other counterparties  the desk will be prepared to conduct reverse repos on a sizable scale as early as a month from now using treasury and agency collateral and with primary dealers as counterparties  staff is also working on two significant expansions of this basic program  the ability to do reverses against agency mbs and the inclusion of counterparties beyond the primary dealers 
the informal consultations with four financial institutions that bill described along with the desks conversations with primary dealers indicate that there is considerable interest among dealers in participating in a term reverse rp program  however the primary dealers note that their participation in the program would be limited by balance sheet constraints  
to some extent such balance sheet concerns reportedly are connected with regulatory capital requirements  while the secs regulatory net capital charges for dealers explicitly exclude transactions with the federal reserve bank of new york regulatory leverage ratios may be an issue for those dealers that are part of bank holding companies  for these institutions the financing of collateral reversed in from the federal reserve could have an appreciable impact on their leverage ratios at the consolidated bank holding company level 
dealers have noted that in many cases balance sheet constraints also stem very importantly from internal guidelines regarding leverage in part such internal guidelines are based on the attention devoted to leverage in the analyses of credit rating agencies and other outside analysts staff continues to investigate ways to mitigate such concerns about balance sheet capacity one avenue currently being explored is the potential for the federal reserve to participate in the fixed income clearing corporation a step that might allow for netting of primary dealers matched book repo transactions with the federal reserve and thereby avoid large increases in the size of their balance sheets 
based on conversations with about half of the dealer community and the staff consultations with banking organizations staff estimates suggest that the primary dealers in aggregate could take on 100 billion to 200 billion or so of reverse rps  the apparent capacity constraint among primary dealers in conducting largescale operations in reverse rps puts a premium on expanding the list of counterparties beyond primary dealers  primary dealers have been informed that additional counterparties may be needed for an effective implementation of this program  work on this front is slated to start soon 
the desk has made substantial progress in laying the operational groundwork for a reverse rp program including contract negotiations the development of automated systems and settlement processes  concerning contracts the legal documentation to support triparty reverse repos is expected to be executed by the primary dealers and clearing banks later this month the desk has also negotiated agreements with the triparty banks on service levels and the general fee structure for triparty reverses  this agreement is also expected to be finalized in the coming days  regarding automation and settlement the desk has tested the existing fedtrade system for use in conducting triparty reverse rps  the desk is in the final stages of preparing for implementation and should be ready to perform endtoend testing with primary dealers clearing banks and settlement systems in early october  the basic version of the reverse rp programtriparty reverse rps with primary dealers against treasury and agency securitieswill be ready to go by the end of next month  work to expand the range of collateral and counterparties is ongoing and should be completed later this year 
turning to the term deposit facility the staff consultations with four banking organizations suggested that they could well be interested in participating in a term deposit program  we do not yet have a reading on small banks interest  the amounts that institutions would be willing to shift from reserve balances into term deposits would depend on various factors including the maturities offered and the interest rate paid on term deposits particularly relative to the rate earned on excess reserves  the banks in our informal consultations indicated that they would want to hold more term deposits if there were some means by which such deposits could be utilized to meet an unusual liquidity demand perhaps through an early withdrawal option or by allowing term deposits to serve as collateral at the discount window 
a staff steering group has been established to oversee four work streams associated with the term deposit facilityprogram design legal documentation governance and implementation 
the design team is studying various aspects of postedrate term deposit facilities including appropriate pricing and maturity structures and it is also considering the set of rules that should apply if the system elects to issue term deposits via an auction  
system legal staff is examining the legal basis for establishing term deposit accounts and is also considering the agreements between reserve banks and depository institutions necessary to support term deposit accounts  
the staff has also begun to discuss governance issues raised by both the postedrate and auctionrate approaches  the key issue is ensuring that rates and quantities would be set in a way that ensures appropriate input from all federal reserve stakeholders 
the implementation group has for some time been developing and testing the computer code necessary to support a term deposit program  using this code dis we to submit tenders through a webbased application  this new code will be deployed at the end of next month and can be activated when the facility is ready to be implemented  as noted in the august briefing some lead time will be required to implement a term deposit facility because dis would have to request and receive electronic certificates to access the application  our expectation is that about one month of lead time would be required to have several thousand depositories positioned to participate      
as discussed at the august meeting reserve collateral accounts or rcas would be new federal reserve deposit accounts designed to facilitate trading of fed funds on a collateralized basis by reducing counterparty credit risk concerns these new accounts might well enable sellers who utilize the accounts to obtain higher bids for the fed funds they sell  
the staff has surveyed two gses about their interest in using rcas  both are examining the option and their internal staffs are reviewing the rca as a new product  they will share the outcome of those internal reviews with federal reserve staff in the near future  the reviews are expected to yield a fairly rich set of information on those gses likely use of rcas 
 rcas are entirely new and the staff is still in a relatively early stage of analysis for these accounts we are waiting to hear back from the gses before determining whether to establish a steering group to oversee future work in this area  internally the rca concept has been discussed with the systems accounting management steering group amsg  the amsg viewed the concept as feasible and similar in some respects to the recent implementation of excess balance accounts  in addition members of the committee on reserve administration have reviewed the proposal  brian will now continue the staff  presentations 
mr madigan3 footnote 3 the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3 end footnote 3  thank you ill be referring to the handout labeled material for briefing on proposed taf and tslf schedules  as noted in brian sacks briefing conditions in shortterm funding markets have improved somewhat further over the intermeeting period  as a result the relative attractiveness of the federal reserves lending facilities has declined given the penaltyrate pricing of most of those programs and so usage of the facilities has continued to diminish  however the federal reserve still needs to make explicit decisions about the amounts of credit offered under the two main auctionbased liquidity programs the taf and the tslf  as announced on june 25 the federal reserve has suspended schedule 1 tslf and tslf option program operations and has reduced the size and frequency of tslf schedule 2 operations to one offering of 75 billion per month  the federal reserve also has reduced the offered amounts under the taf in three steps so far from a peak of 150 billion per auction to 75 billion per auction in september  those reductions in taf auctions have been determined and announced one month at a time based on observation of auction results and assessments of market conditions 
however the staff believes that it would be desirable at this stage to formulate and publish plans for the auction schedules and amounts to be offered over the period through january these plans would incorporate a further reduction in liquidity support over that period while still providing assurance to market participants that the federal reserve will provide sufficient liquidity over yearend  by making its plans explicit the federal reserve would help reduce market uncertainty and would provide market participants with sufficient time to arrange other sources of shortterm funding 
the announced schedules should be designed to mesh with the federal reserves overall plans for winding down its liquidity programs  as you know most federal reserve liquidity programs are set to expire on february 1  however the taf does not have a fixed expiration date indeed when the taf was first announced in december 2007 the federal reserve suggested that consideration would be given to making the facility permanent and indicated that public comment would be obtained before any decision was made regarding the establishment of a permanent facility 
the staff recommends initiating soon the process of seeking public comment on a proposal for a permanent taf  subject to your comments and approval by the board we would describe several possible taf structures in the request for public comment  those possible structures could range from a deactivated facility that was on the shelf but ready for use if circumstances warranted to regular taf auctions of a substantial volume of funds  several intermediate alternatives could also be described  the notice would probably be published for a fortyfive or sixtyday public comment period the staff anticipates that the board would also seek input from reserve bank boards of directors based on the comments received the board would decide late this year or early next year whether to establish a permanent taf 
regardless of whether the taf will become permanent the nearterm path of taf operations has to be decided the staff has developed proposed schedules for taf and tslf auctions for the next four months they are shown on the last page of the package both of these schedules involve considerable reductions in offered amounts into january  as ill explain the taf schedule could be part of a transition to zero low or still sizable auctioned amounts  the proposed tslf schedule is designed to allow tslf auctioned amounts to move down to zero by february consistent with the current expiration date for that program 
as shown in the upper panel the staff proposes that taf auctions in the 28day cycle the unshaded rows be held steady at their current level of 75 billion each through midjanuary  the purpose of leaving those auction amounts unchanged for the next few months is to provide substantial assurance of the availability of adequate liquidity over yearend the current cycle of auctions of 84day funds the shaded rows would be modified in two ways  first the terms would be reduced initially to 70 days and then to 42 days the purpose of shortening the terms is to align the maturity dates with those of the 28day auctions  and second the amounts of these longerterm auctions would be reduced from the current level of 75 billion to 25 billion in november before those auctions are discontinued late this year  beginning in december the system would conduct only one auction per month for 28day funds by midjanuary a maximum of 75 billion of taf funds would be outstanding taf credit outstanding currently stands at just under 200 billion  depending on the decision regarding a permanent taf that amount could subsequently be brought down to zero or phased into the schedule for permanent taf operations 
some policymakers have expressed a view that the minimum bid rate for taf auctions should be increased from its current level of 25 basis points equal to the interest rate on excess reserves in order to provide a penalty for using the facility  in the staffs view a significant penalty is inconsistent with an auction facility and it would be incompatible with the effective operation of a permanent taf  and with bid amounts in taf declining steadily and below amounts being offered in the auctions it is not clear that a penalty rate is currently necessary to discourage usage  moreover once offering amounts are reduced sufficiently the auction rate should rise above its minimum 
the proposed tslf schedule shown in the lower panel specifies that monthly auctions will be reduced in two steps from the current level of 75 billion to 25 billion by november  the offered amount would be held steady at 25 billion in december and january  the term to maturity of the december 3 operation is planned for 35 days so that the loans do not mature right at the beginning of january  tslf operations would cease in early february with the maturation of the january 7 auction consistent with the facilitys alreadyannounced expiration on february 1 
a draft press release is included in your package  that document sets out the proposed schedules and states that the federal reserve will soon request public comment on a permanent taf  it also indicates that the federal reserve would be prepared to temporarily increase the sizes of taf and tslf operations or conduct additional offcycle operations with terms that span yearend if needed to address transitory market strains 
finally i should note that we will need to coordinate adjustments to the taf with 
possible changes to the swap arrangements with foreign central banks  brian sacks 
and nathans staffs will confer with foreign central banks to formulate plans for the 
eventual elimination of exposures under the current swap arrangements  a related 
issue which we plan to raise for your consideration at the november meeting 
involves the advisability of establishing a set of permanent swap lines 

that concludes the staff presentation we would be pleased to respond to your questions 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  according to the agenda the sequence of the meeting goes as follows first questions for the staff there will then be an opportunity for  unstructured interaction on these issues and then finally of course two full gorounds  so everyone will have ample opportunity to  express their views on all of these subjects 
lets begin first with just questions for the staff  are there questions  vice chairman dudley 
vice chairman dudley i had a question for jim  obviously as we contemplate the agency debt and agency mbs purchase programs the issues are related to our ability to actually have the sort of suspenders in place in terms of reverse repo or term deposit facilities to be confident that we can actually do that if we needed to  the reverse repo instrument as you described is a size constraint for the dealers how confident are you that the reverse repo program  can be successfully introduced to a broader set of counterparties highly confident  not so confident  i think the answer to that question is relevant for thinking about our balance sheet size also are there potential legal impediments or is this just an operational issue 
mr clouse ive had a number of conversations with chris burke and his colleaguesof course brian may want to comment on this as welland i think that the perception is that it will be a challenge to pull in a lot of additional counterparties  one obvious lending group would be the money funds you would like to have them participateconceivably even banks that are holding huge volumes of reserves might want to be lenders of cash against securities  so there are natural sets of institutions that you might want to target but in order to get them into the system you have to have legal agreements established with themthat takes some time i have learned  and there are also all sorts of operational difficulties in setting up collateral arrangements and having the monitoring in place  theres a perception at least that you could get a substantial number of additional counterparties in place by the end of the year but i think chris and his colleagues at your reserve bank have their work cut out for them 
vice chairman dudley  i guess what im asking is over the longer termyou said nine months from nowcould you drain a trillion dollars of reserves if you had to  are you pretty confident you could do that  at the end of the day thats really the key question 
actually there are two questions  one do you think interest on excess reserves would be sufficient i do but i think other people would have some questions about that  so then the second question is to guard against the potential risk of that not being sufficient what are the suspenders then the issue is are you highly confident that you could get the suspenders up in operation eventually  i dont think yearend is necessarily that relevant but if you told me that you couldnt get it up by midyear 2010 i would start to be nervous 
mr clouse my own personal view for what its worth is that the combination of reverse rps and the term deposits could be very powerful nine months from now  the term deposit facility in particular could drain a huge amount of reserves obviously it depends on the rates that were willing to offer as for the reverse rps i think we could find a very large amount of lenders there as well  so i think the combination of those two programs will put us in pretty good shape 
vice chairman dudley thank you 
chairman bernanke  president rosengren 
mr rosengren my question follows along the same lines again its to jim  in thinking about the term deposit facility could we use the term auction facility apparatus to do the term deposit facility because one way of thinking about the term deposit is as a reverse discount window loan right  we already have an apparatus that has an auction for loans so if we were going to use an auction format for deposits instead it would seem like we already have an apparatus to do it and it would deal with some of the questions about the permanence of the taf if it could go either way during times when we wanted either to push out a lot of reserves or pull in a lot of reserves so when youre thinking about the term deposit facility are you thinking about it as being something like the term auction facility or is it a very different structure 
mr clouse  i think one variation on it would be very much like the term auction facility in structure the committee could establish amounts that it wished to auction take bids and it would be very much like the taf just in reverse  we probably wouldnt use the existing technology the program for submitting bids and receiving results and various spreadsheets that have been developed  its not the most sophisticated automation but sherry edwards and company have been working for about a year to develop the code in the statistics and reserves system to support an auction and to have all of the entries pass through to reserve accounting and to the federal reserve banks accounting systems properly so i think on that dimension were in very good shape for the term deposit program 
mr rosengren  conceptually that seems much easier than depending on the primary dealer system if what we wanted to do was pull out a lot of reserves 
mr clouse i dont like to view them as competing things  i really view them as kind of complementary and it could be that both are very useful 
chairman bernanke governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i have a question for bill and a related one for jim and then a suggestion on the press release 
heres the question for bill  you put a lot of emphasis on downward pressure on shortterm funding rates as these reserves came into play  in the good old days we used to think of the deposit rate as the floor for market rates because banks would be willing to arbitrage  i was wondering as market conditions improved bank capital increased and they got more confident whether they wouldnt be willing to do more arbitrage and put upward pressure on shortterm rates 
mr english bring them up to 25 basis points 
mr kohn up to whatever the deposit rate isright  i think the answer might beor the problem might bethis leverage ratio  but i was encouraged by your previous finding that the leverage ratio wouldnt be a problem with the amount of reserves and i also was encouraged by the response of the banks namely that they were putting emphasis on riskweighted assets rather than on total assets as they thought about their capital ratios  so i wondered about that counterforce pushing those shortterm rates up to the deposit rate 
my second point for jim is related to the same thing  you said that there was a concern about bank capital relative to the reverse rps also related to the leverage ratio rather than the riskweighted assets  but we did say that the leverage ratio wouldnt be a constraint for reserves  so it shouldnt bein total anyhowa constraint for some other federal reserve liability that is reverse rps  now the difference might be that the reverse rps were being done with a smaller number of counterparties so all of the pressure would be on 15 of the largest institutions  but they probably account for a lot of the assets anyhow so i wondered whether it was a question of distribution implying that the leverage ratio wasnt a problem for reserves but it would be a problem for reverse rps 
my final comment is on the press release  i dont think it should be commenting on what forms the taf might take if it became permanent  the committee hasnt had a chance to discuss it  who knows how this is going to come out  i think its all right to say well be looking at it but not suggest what it could be 
chairman bernanke  president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  i have three questions  first for mr english about the four banking organizations responding that they wouldnt change lending terms  i assume youre not shocked they didnt tell you they would ease credit standards 
mr english  in the last senior loan officer survey we asked them when they would move back to more normal standards 
mr lacker  on the lending terms arent a lot of loans priced as a spread over a market rate 
mr english  yes 
mr lacker  so if they say they werent going to change lending terms would you interpret that to mean they wouldnt change the spread 
mr english  yes 
mr lacker so its sort of like a partial equilibrium response and if other stuff that went on pushed down rates it could push down lending terms as well 
mr english  it would push down those base rates  thats right 
mr lacker  right 
mr english  though im not sure that youd get a lot of action there at least on the business side because one base rate is the primei dont think its going to be cut much  the other is threemonth liborits already pretty low  but i agree conceptually 
mr lacker  right i have a question for mr clouse on these reserve collateral accounts  when you think about sort of a medical intervention you wouldnt run around and do that on the basis of a twomonthold working paper instead youd look for peerreviewed research  you guys are working hard on implementation  what are you doing to check the robustness of the theoretical basis for what youre designing this program around 
mr clouse  im not sure about the theoretical robustness but i definitely think the staff shares your basic concerns about whether this would really function in the way the theory might suggest  one of the things that the staff has done is to consult with the gses to find out whether their view of it would align properly  i think its also important that we consult with the other side of that transaction the banks that would be putting these liabilities on their balance sheets to find out whether they in fact would find it attractive because it really takes both sides of that transaction to make this thing work and i think its really unclear at this stage  the staff has more work to do to vet this to be more confident that it could be useful 
mr lacker do you have the results of the gse conversations yet 
mr clouse  not yet no  theyre actually doing a fairly extensive review  theyre treating it as a new product and theyre putting it through a fairly standard process that they would use in analyzing a new product and theyre going to report those results back to us fairly shortly so i hope well learn a good bit from those 
mr lacker did you say theyre putting it through their standard new product evaluation  laughter 
and finally a point about term deposits  you were talking about some features that would make these pretty liquidtheyd be able to pledge them at the discount window and withdraw them without penalty if you make these things really accessible then im not sure why draining reserves and putting them there would have any effect  why would you expect that dont you need some stark sharp constraining differences in order for them to have any sort of monetary effect 
mr clouse  absolutely  first of all just the pure operational dimension of having an early withdrawal option for a term deposit is really very difficult  but beyond that to your point certainly if there were a withdrawal option youd want to have a pretty stiff penalty associated with it so that it wouldnt just be relabeling reserves  it would have to have a fairly clear distinction in order to perform the function thats intended 
mr lacker thank you 
chairman bernanke  president plosser 
mr plosser i have a couple of questions for bill and one for brian  one is just a factual question in your first chart where you talked about the projected level of excess reserves were you including in that the increase in the roughly 200 billion from the end of the sfp program 
mr english i think thats the first peak 
mr plosser is that the first peak 
mr english  yes 
mr plosser okay  i just wasnt sure whether it was included  second i was thinking about the story and the analysis that youve done  at the end you say well okay what if this analysis is wrong  what would the outcomes be  my question is how we should think about metrics and variables and things we should be looking at as we go forward during this period of very high reserves to get a handle on which way this story is actually going because i think theres a lot of uncertainty about how this might in fact play out  how would we structure our ongoing analysis of whats going on out there so that we would be alert to whether or not the kinds of things that might be the alternative play out are there metrics that we should be looking at  are there things that we want to monitor carefully to be able to get a handle on that 
mr english  there are but i think theyre things were already monitoring carefully  they would be things like the short end of the yield curve how is it behaving  if somehow the high level of reserves and reduced demand for reserves is causing some sort of arbitrage into short and intermediateterm safe assets youd expect to see that at the short end of the treasury yield curve 
mr plosser so is that like the decline in shortterm treasuries visvis the higher reserves that we witnessed recently 
mr english  at least over the intermeeting period its across the whole yield curve  so i dont think it matches up with this sort of story which id expect at least would be concentrated at the short end because those are more substitutable 
youd also want to look at how banks are behaving  if this story is really going to have legs for the economy at some point despite what they told us banks are going to have to ease some standards and terms on their lending so clearly were spending considerable time thinking about the bank lending data and the senior loan officer opinion survey and how we integrate these things into our modeling 
mr plosser would things like quantities of loans quantities of various kinds as opposed to just prices become important 
mr english  over the intermeeting period as we discussed in the greenbook the survey of terms of business lending came in for the most recent quarter and showed another considerable widening of spreads on business loans  we can look at some information we have on prices in the syndicated loan market and also as you say at the quantities  our weekly bank credit data may be informative about whether banks are beginning to move 
mr plosser all right thank you i have a question for brian on the taf  ill fess up im one of the ones who keeps asking about price as opposed to just quantities and im a little bit confused brian we dont want penalty rates  the committee made a conscious decision a while back when we cut the spread between the primary rate and the funds rate to reduce the penalty rate of being at the discount window  we did that as a conscious decision  but for quite a while now we have been in a situation where people can almost confidently predict that theyre going to get a lower rate if they go to the auction than if they choose to borrow from the discount window directly  there are borrowers who come to our discount windows who are of a scale and size and scope where the taf auction isnt easily available to them in the amounts that they would like to borrow  so in fact were taking one group of borrowers who want to go to the discount window and were making them borrow at a penalty rate  right now were in an environment whereand de facto weve set this upif youre big enough and want to participate in the taf you can get money at a cheaper rate 
i remain a little bit puzzled about why we want to perpetuate that differential  theyre both discount window lending  why dont we want to make borrowers from both of these mechanisms more similar  i understand that if you reduce the quantities enough at an auction you can raise the price above that minimum but taf borrowing is longer term and there are some other restrictions  so i still remain somewhat puzzled at the reluctance to move the minimum bid closer to the primary credit rate the rate at which many banks still come and borrow from us  maybe im being dense here but the logic is escaping me i havent figured it out yet  so could you help me out 
mr madigan well i think the basic distinction that we see is the difference between a standing facility and an auction facility  im defining a standing facility as one where the borrowing institution comes to us seeking funds  we want to provide incentives for that bank or firm to find funds in the open market before they come to us and so we charge a penalty rate for that which is consistent with traditional central banking theory  by contrast in the taf and the tslf were trying at least conceptually to place fixed amounts of dollars into the system that is make fixed amounts of dollars available to the system and let the market set the price  if we set any significant penalty wed simply be undercutting that attempt to provide the dollars into the market in fixed quantities  wed be driving off the borrowers 
mr plosser we have no idea what the quantities are going to be because its underbid every time so i dont quite understand  if were not maxing out on the quantities then we really arent setting the quantities the market is setting the quantities and its setting the quantities based on a low price that we basically are offering  so im having trouble reconciling all of this 
mr madigan well i think its fundamentally starting from a view that an auction mechanism simply is not consistent with the penalty price 
chairman bernanke  president evans 
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i have two questions  the first is for bill and the second one is either for bill or maybe for brian sack  when you presented the simulation results i had been conflicted in reading the memo and responding to the fact that the banks were saying weve got these excess reserves  were really not intending to lend them out  you did the simulationi guess thats kind of natural to look at the implications of lower shortterm rates and that would presumably be more accommodative  but im wondering if you learn something else from the surveythat there might be added dysfunction in the lending channel if the banks arent looking to lend out excess reserves that they currently have available to them  did we learn more about their lack of intention to stimulate the economy through more lending or is it pretty much the way we had thought about it before 
and that led me to think about the second question earlier in the year we talked a pretty good amount i thought in terms of market segmentation and how effective our various programs would be depending on how clogged up markets were  arbitrage kind of disperses funds that we would put into the financial system but when its more segmented we have a larger effect  so i guess im back to the mbs question do you think that that program is more effective in a price sense  do we have more segments i dont think we have more segmentation  do we have less segmentation  regarding the rate effects that we might have estimated early on would they be smaller now because these are more dispersed i think thats what president lacker was trying to get at with treasuries but im not exactly sure 
and then theres the next part of this question which you can answer either today or later  do we have an idea of what an estimate of the mbs rates will be when were done with the lsap programs if it were the full 1 trillion tapered at the end of the first quarter and if we did what president hoenig suggested only 1 trillion tapered to the end of the fourth quarter  what would those rates look like at the end of the first quarter  im not sure i understand the different implications or at least our thinking on that 
mr english let me try talking about banks for a second  i think what we learned from the banks on the whole was consistent with what we thought before which is that theyre very tight and we think that they will only gradually ease  in the staff forecast thats basically what we built ingradually over the forecast horizon banks loosen up they get more comfortable taking on risk they build up some capital they get more comfortable with their liquidity positions and they start lending in a more accommodative way  i think broadly at least thats consistent with what the banks were saying  theyre not going to be going out any time soon and lending aggressively and basically we didnt expect to hear that 
mr evans  and the interest rate cut in the model analysis already takes into account some impediment from the normal type of lending 
mr english the baseline takes account of it 
mr evans  okay thank you  do we have an idea about market segmentation 
mr sack our view is that its not that the mbs purchases have had an effect and the treasury purchases just didnt work  its just that the sizes were disproportionate  its easy to see the mbs effects because the program was so large relative to that market its harder to see the treasury effects because the purchase is supposed to work through supply but net supply was actually going up quite rapidly so we may have offset some upward pressure on yields 
mr evans  well i was thinking about it differently  you can do the mbs you can do the treasuries if theyre segmented theyre different  if theres no segmentation theres going to be some arbitrage across the different markets so it almost doesnt matter where you dump those funds 
mr sack yes i think the purchases take duration out of the market regardless  there are some other differences  the mbs purchases actually take some negative convexity out of the market too and you dont have that with treasuries  so there are some differences  but the big effect is all of these purchases pull out duration and in that regard you would think they would have some effect on all longerterm assets and i think thats true to a degree but i think one thing we realize is that theres not perfect substitution across our asset classes so when we talk about largescale mbs purchases we see the effect most pronounced on mbs rates 
mr evans  but in march we were stymied by the segmentation i thought  we thought it was really big and now things seem different  so i would guess that the estimated effect would be smaller 
mr sack well i think it means that there are spillovers but theyre just hard to see  if we talk about the effect of the mbs purchases and we look at the spread and say well maybe it looks like the spread is 50 basis points so the effect on the spread is 50 basis points  i think it means probably that the effect on the rate is actually larger and some of it has spilled over into treasuries as well 
chairman bernanke governor duke 
ms duke my question revolves around how your analysis and your conclusions would have been different if the banks had expressed a stronger willingness to lend some time in the near future  it seems to me that when we started down this path we did expect the rate we were paying to be a floor on the fed funds rate and it turned out not to be  but if the banks were strongly interested in lending and chasing loan funds it seems as if that would be the point where it would turn out to be a floor  am i thinking about that correctly or not 
mr english it might well push up shortterm rates as banks were less likely to run off deposits and manage liabilities because they saw better lending opportunities  in terms of the simulation that we did one of the knobs we didnt turn was an easing in credit  if you turn that knob youd get a bigger effect on output and unemploymentstill not huge but a larger effect for sure  so i think that if the banks had been telling us yes were likely to ease our lending standards and terms early next year then our exercise would have showed a bigger effect on output and probably a smaller effect on rates 
chairman bernanke  president fisher 
mr fisher first mr chairman i agree with president plossers question about taf versus the penalty rate on the discount window but we talked about that a long long time ago  i think its a good point to take into account 
my question is for bill  we had four institutions in this little sample  they account for 35 percent of the excess reserves  how many institutions would you have to take into account say to get to 75 percent of excess reserves or 50 percent  in other words are they concentrated in the top ten  five twenty guess 
mr english i dont know the answer  id have to check  i think the whole industry is concentrated so if you took the top 25 banks youd probably have a huge majority of the reserves but i just dont know for sure 
mr fisher i guess what concerns me is that these monies are languishing in the system  theyre unlent and theyre unmultiplied  and again here we have differentiation in the market  we have been worried about whenjust to use an ugly analogythis giant fur ball finally gets released from this big pipe  were worried about a way to neutralize it  but meanwhile its lying fallow in a sense from the standpoint of people that want to borrow assuming theres loan demand  if you go through each one of your boxes we dont know how much buffer people want over regulatory norms no increase in lending  mr lacker pointed out no change in lending terms and standards  i guess again like president plosser i may be a dunce on this one  im not saying youre a dunce charles  laughter 
mr plosser ive been called worse things 
mr fisher  ill share the dunce cap with you  im concerned that this money is unlent and unmultiplied and represses velocity  i realize that the suspenders that president dudley talked about go to what were trying to treat but thats not an issue presently  i just worry about the distortions it creates in the system and i wondered if you had any comments on that or maybe i just need a basic tutorial from you also 
mr english i need a little help on what your concern is 
mr fisher  it concerns me that weve ramped up reserve balances to 12 trillion money that were almost incentivizing not to go out into the marketplace and paying a rate of interest right  its small but it does concern me that its not being put into the system  we have an unlent unmultiplied buildup in reserves now we worry that it could expand too quickly and come back in the system and thats all of these treatments that you went through in your second presentation was all about  but in the meantime its like theyre sitting in the system lying fallow  am i missing something here 
ms yellen we could cut the interest rate we pay on reserves and then it would be less likely to lie fallow 
chairman bernanke  it wouldnt be in the system at all if we werent doing the quantitative easing and its not constraining anything else because its not affecting leverage ratios 
mr fisher  as i said this is what happens in quantitative easing 
chairman bernanke  right 
mr fisher anyway your chart number 1 shows a very rapid rundown  im just questioning i guess that rapid rundown given the unwillingness of people to lend and the incentives were providing for reserve retention  but if its a dumb question lets take it off the table mr chairman 
mr english  well i think the decline in the stock of reserves has to do with the fact that securities that were bulking up on now will mature the mortgages will prepay and so those assets will run off over time and currency will grow over time 
mr fisher i guess what ive gotten out of this conversation is a better understanding of why safe short and intermediateterm securities have been priced as theyve been priced and are yielding what theyre yielding but i remain concerned that these monies remain unlent and unmultiplied in the short term 
chairman bernanke  president plosser you had a twohander 
mr plosser yes i wanted to follow up on governor dukes question  she asked about lending standards and banks behavior  the way i interpreted what she was asking was about the supply side or willingness of banks to lend but as we witnessed in the last intermeeting period a lot of the privatesector forecasts for growth have been ramped up substantially in the last few months both for this year and for next year in some cases to varying degrees  so in some ways the issue is not just the banks willingness to lend but also what the new demand for loans is going to be  while banks may not lower their lending standards as the demand for loans from the private sector begins to ramp up with continued economic growth they may not change their lending standards but those excess reserves will get translated into loans as the demand for new loans goes up and the price may rise as well  so its not just what the banks are willing to do but also how demand will evolve over the course of this recovery that will determine some of that  you did mention that but i think both of them are clearly important 
mr english i agree as i think i said in my briefing a couple of the banks pointed exactly to this as the economy recovers demand for loans will pick up even if they dont do any easing at all 
mr plosser exactly 
mr english they will have more creditworthy customers coming to them and they plan to meet that demand 
mr plosser using reserves to do so 
chairman bernanke  president lacker 
mr lacker i will follow up on a couple of things  thank you mr chairman  bill you talked earlier about where in the yield curve you would expect the effect of quantitative easing to show up and you suggested the short end  i guess youre thinking six months or less 
mr english  well the banks talked about short and intermediateterm maturities out to two or three years 
mr lacker two or three years  okay  weve seen that  but youre saying that because weve seen effects farther out the yield curve  that counts against quantitative easing as a monocausal explanation for what has happened over the intermeeting period  but it doesnt rule it out right 
mr english  well it could be a piece  i think it doesnt rule it out but as i say i would have expected a change in the shape of the yield curve  what we got was pretty much a uniform shift 
mr lacker they hold a fair amount of agencies is my understanding 
mr english  agency mbs for sure  im not sure about straight agency debt 
mr lacker yes i dont think theres much debt  i think agency mbs 
brian i have a question about your yield effect estimates shouldnt that depend on how they are financed like what we do on the other side of our balance sheet right  if our early purchases were essentially sterilized by offsetting reductions in borrowings thats going to have a different effect on agency yields than if we add enough to reserves that it induces those yields to fall do you see what im saying 
mr sack when you think about the effects through a portfoliobalance channel youre right that it depends on if and how the purchases are sterilized  if youre buying mbs and sterilizing that by selling longterm treasuries youd be having a much smaller effect on duration in the market and so it would be getting a smaller yield effect 
mr lacker right 
mr sack if its sterilized through reverse repos for example even if the reserve paths arent different essentially the portfoliobalance effect still works because youve changed the duration and the supply of those assets in the market which is what we think at least partially prompts the effect on yields 
mr lacker the estimate you gave us earlieri cant remember what it was   what was the estimate  
mr sack the estimate of the effect of total program purchases 
mr lacker no it was the incremental effect 
mr sack i said that if the mbs purchases were ended at 1 trillion then perhaps the upward pressure on mbs rates would be 15 to 30 basis points 
mr lacker 15 to 30 
mr sack again its a very uncertain estimate but just to put an order of magnitude on the table 
mr madigan if i could just break in for a minute brians estimates are consistent with our previous staff estimates which were based on an event study methodology  that by its nature should abstract from any effect due to changes in our financing of the securities  we simply look at how much yields change during a narrow window of time in which announcements of our purchases were made and we got estimates very similar to those that brian did 
mr sack right this is really to a point bill dudley made  we are talking strictly about supply effects portfoliobalance effects  any signals about the path of shortterm interest rates or the fomcs policy inclinations would be on top of that  so if it were interpreted as a step towards tightening and market participants for example moved up the expected timing of tightening you would get further effects 
mr lacker well now im confused  you gave us these estimates earlier in the year are you interpreting these announcements as being viewed by market participants as sterilized or unsterilized additions to the stock of our holdings 
mr sack i would say unsterilized certainly the biggest announcements in march were beyond the period in which the desk was sterilizing the operations 
mr lacker how does this estimate line up with what has happened so far which presumably is sterilized 
mr sack im sorry  what exactly is sterilized 
mr lacker you gave me some estimates of effects  you were talking about estimates of effects that have occurred so far during a period where we have essentially sterilized them 
mr sack no i would say we have not sterilized the purchases 
mr lacker i dont see how you can say that  earlier in the year we were buying mbs and you kept forecasting increases in reserves  they kept not happening borrowing kept falling it looks as if they were sterilized 
chairman bernanke de facto sterilized because of the offsetting movements 
mr lacker yes de facto sterilized by offsetting right 
mr sack okay but if were talking about sterilization through shortterm credit and through the withdrawal of shortterm credit youre still left with a change in the supply of the longterm asset youre still left with the shift in duration from the purchases  there are different kinds of sterilization if youre sterilizing as i said by selling longterm assets that would really work against the portfoliobalance effect  if its being sterilized by reducing shortterm credit i dont think it works against the portfoliobalance effect that much because it is not affecting the fact that the market is holding that much less duration than it was before 
chairman bernanke i think i detected a little appetite for coffee around the table  laughter so why dont we take fifteen minutes and come back at 405 pm thank you 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke why dont we recommence  weve had a number of issues raised by the presentations first there were some recommendations from the desk on largescale asset purchases including possible tapering strategies  second we had some discussion of reserve management tools and the progress there  third there was a proposal essentially on the taf and the tslf let me just mention parenthetically that as i understand it from talking to scott no votes are needed to implement those proposals because the tslf directive in particular told the desk to wind down the options as conditions permit  id be happy to hear comments  but if people would like to disagree with the press release or the plan please say so if we get more or less consensus around the table we wont have to take a formal action on that i think so those are three topics that we can talk about 
this part of the meeting is billed on the agenda as an opportunity for informal unstructured interaction laughter which i am going to duck i think in a minute  i hope this is a chance for us just to have some interchange  let me just be very clear that we will not be making any decisions in this part of the meeting the decisions on largescale asset purchases and so on will be taken tomorrow in the policy round  so please dont feel that you are compelled to speak in order to get your voice heardyou will be heard  but it would be useful i think to have some additional discussion 
before we get into that i just wanted to say a word or two about the quantitative easing mechanism because i feel as if theres a certain amount of confusion going on  so let me just say three straightforward things 
the first point and i think we all agree on this is that any action we takethrough purchases or auctions or whateverto put reserves into the banking system on net will be expansionary because whatever the banks do along the lines of what they told bill english and his colleagueswhether its buying other assets or lending or whatever action they takewill tend to be expansionary  of course in equilibrium this will be reflected in lower shortterm interest rates across a range of potential assets  and thats essentially how quantitative easing works its meant to be expansionary and i think it would be in the context that were using it here president yellen made a good point during the break which was that quantitative easing should be expansionary even if the leverage ratio were binding  the reason is that in order to avoid the leverage ratio firms would either have to get rid of managed liabilities or lower deposit rates and otherwise prevent the inflow of cash into their institution  if depositors are not incentivized to put money into banks they will go to money market mutual funds or to other types of shortterm credit markets and that again will have the effect of lowering shortterm interest rates and therefore be expansionary  so i dont think that there really is any barrier to quantitative easing being effective in our current institutional environment   
the second observation i would make is based on bills simulations based on what we know we think the quantitative easing effects are probably pretty small  shortterm interest rates are already low they might be made a little bit lower by quantitative easing but i dont see much chance of a huge overshoot in a short period of time  i think thats not what the evidence suggests its not what the japanese experience suggests  so quantitative easing should be expansionary but i dont see it as being a major part of our overall monetary policy stance 
and then the third thing id like to say is that we can exit from the high level of reserves  we have in fact three methods to do thatwe have two belts as well as a pair of suspenders  first of all we have the interest on reserves which may be leaky but certainly if its raised high enough it will tighten policythere seems to be little doubt about that  second we have the various ways of sterilizing reserves through reverse repos or time deposits  i wasnt quite clear about the timing but my sense is that these things will be coming online by early next year  so over the time frame in which we would have to do a significant amount of tightening we should have the tools in place to do that  then of course the third method we know we can do is sell assets i think that that would not only have effects via the reversal of quantitative easing but it also would have very powerful signaling and market effects   
these are very important issues for us to understand  but i felt there was an impression somehow that we were not in control of the situation  i dont think thats true  obviously its a difficult and novel situation but i do think that the staff and all of us working together have a pretty good understanding of how to manage this and how this relates to standard monetary policy 
so thats my little homily  let me now open up the floor for any comments on asset purchases reserve management taf tslf any of those things that anyone would like to bring up and i would invite interaction  would anyone like to raise any points  ah president lacker i knew i could count on you laughter 
mr lacker i just have a question about sfp  if you want to talk about this more tomorrow in your presentation and tee it up to do that im fine with that but it sort of gets to a broader issue the sfp is now projected to fall consistent with the treasurys announcement and then rise again i noticed that in our previous bluebook it had been projected to stay longer where it is now fall and remain at zero permanently  i was confused about the shift in the forecast after this intermeeting period and i wondered what that represents 
chairman bernanke yes let me comment on that briefly  first of all i think its important for us to be able to do what we need to do without relying on the treasury  obviously we need to maintain that independence and that flexibility  whatever help they can provide of course is a bonus ive had some discussions with secretary geithner and others and the view was that because the debate on the debt ceilingwhich will probably be toward the end of the yearcould be contentious for a lot of reasons it would be a good idea for us to have a low profile and not be part of this discussion for that reason i suggested to him that they run it down to a very low level until such time as all that discussion was completed  once the debt ceiling is raised they are perfectly comfortable bringing the sfps back up to some level  of course at one point it was over 500 billionis that right brian 
mr madigan thats correct 
chairman bernanke so theres some scope there depending on how high the debt ceiling goes but that being said there is a sort of sine wave aspect of this if we run into a debt ceiling again for example at the end of next year  so i think its something that will on average be of some assistance if we get into a sterilization mode but clearly we dont want to count on that as an essential element of our strategy 
mr lacker its a 185 billion bulge obviously  and it adds a lot right at the peak of that curve there 
chairman bernanke when is the peak in the reserves 
mr madigan its early next year  its in bills chart 
chairman bernanke middle of next year i thought 
mr english  well i think theres an early peak because of the sfp and then the later peak because of the condition of our purchases 
chairman bernanke right theres a peak because of the sfp but of course the balance sheet doesnt max out until after the mbs would be settled sometime early next year  and by that time if all goes well the sfp would be back in action 
mr lacker you took into account the monetary policy effects when you discussed this with the secretary 
chairman bernanke well given that were not in a mode of tightening at this point i think that the effects would occur only through quantitative easing  i think theyd be modest but if necessary of course we can adjust in other dimensions  
mr lacker the longerrun projection used to be zero  why were we projecting zero and then we changed that to 200 billion 
chairman bernanke i dont know 
mr madigan on further reflection we thought it might make more sense just to assume that the level was held up because it is a possible tool for absorbing reserves in the future 
mr lacker do we have an understanding with the treasury about it returning to 200 billion 
chairman bernanke my personal discussions with the secretary suggested that they were very comfortable raising it up again when the debt ceiling permitted  but again i dont think we should have either a formal understanding nor should we rely on it because of the independence issue 
vice chairman did you have a comment 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  i dont know if we should talk about the agency mbs purchase program today or tomorrow but it is 415 so today seems like a good time  i think your comments on the exit were very appropriate in the sense that if we really think that the exit is manageable then you really have to take that concern off the table in terms of thinking about the agency mbs purchase program  so the discussion is then based on how do you want financial conditions to evolve over the next say 6 to 12 months 
my view is that the end of the agency mbs purchase program is going to tighten financial conditions over that time frame in any case  we can argue about how much its going to tighten but its going to move in that direction  so the question is given that were already on a path that financial conditions are going to tighten why would you want to pare back this program  that would just exacerbate the tightening in financial conditions at a time that policy is not as accommodative as we would like  if you look at the bluebook the unconstrained federal funds rate path is minus 4 percent  so i really dont see the logic for why wed want to back away from this program if we stipulate that we arent worried about the exit problem 
if you are worried about the exit problem then i can understand why you could care about whether the balance sheet was 100 billion bigger or smaller  my view is that not only should we do the entire 1 trillion i think we should commit to doing that 1 trillion at this meeting for three reasons 
mr bullard are we doing the policy debate now i can get into the policy debate if you want 
chairman bernanke lets let him finish and then you can respond 
mr bullard you just said dont go off on your policy round today  hes preempting the debate 
vice chairman dudley im happy to defer until tomorrow if youd like 
mr bullard i dont mind but if you want to do it now we can do it now 
chairman bernanke all right  why dont you defer that point until tomorrow 
vice chairman dudley okay fair enough 
chairman bernanke are there any other questions about the broader issues president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  i had the impression from earlier conversations weve had that at least at one stage there were two mechanisms under consideration one being the classic corridor system and the other being a mechanism more centered on interest on reserves where the interest on reserves would become the policy rate  is it a foregone conclusion that were going back to a classic corridor system the whole discussion is about the ability to manipulate excess reserves in an interest on reserves regime to a degree that we could decouple those things  maybe im the one who is unclear but are we going back to a classic corridor system  is that a foregone conclusion 
chairman bernanke  well we werent really on a corridor system before  we had a target which was the federal funds rate and we were manipulating reserves to hit that target our interest on reserves strategy would be a corridor system  it would be a rate at which we would pay interest which presumably would be the floor or would help establish the floor and then there would be a lending rate which would presumably be the ceiling 
i think thats a really good question  heres the problem we have with the federal funds rate given some of the things we might be doing in order to try to get better control of reserves we may make the federal funds rate a less informative interest rate  for example right now most of the liquidity in the federal funds market is coming from the gses  if we start pulling their liquidity out in order to firm up the interest rate floor then the federal funds market might be a very illiquid market  theres still a banktobank market but we dont have the same kind of data on that 
so i think we have three optionsbrian you and the staff can certainly comment  one would be to find a way to do the federal funds rate including perhaps additional information from bank transactions  the second would be to choose another shortterm rate like the repo rate which might work  and the third would be to make the interest rate on reserves and the primary credit rate the announced variables which of course we know we can do  we could imagine a statement of policy that would announce changes in those two interest rates plus some open market operations to sterilize a certain amount of reserves  ive mentioned this to staff  i do think we need to give this some more thought  brian do you have anything to add 
mr madigan just one additional comment mr chairman  i think it would be helpful and i wasnt sure what exactly president lockharts question was directed at in the following sense i think its useful to distinguish between the transition phase where there will be a very high level of reserve balancesand that may be over a matter of yearsand the subsequent longrun steady state for monetary policy implementation  they may involve two fairly different approaches to implementing monetary policy  for instance it may be the case that the excess reserves rate does serve as the floor or at least a soft floor during the transition phase as the quantity of reserves is going down  but the committee would have it at its disposal and the staff would come back to report to the committee at some point on the possibility of a number of different operating frameworks further in the future 
chairman bernanke youre working on that 
mr madigan yes 
chairman bernanke okay good any other points governor warsh 
mr warsh  there was discussion in a memo about when we get to exit and whether we should supplement those actions with asset sales there was also a discussion with plenty of caveats about what kind of losses could be realized on that portfolio if rates were to go up 100 basis points my first instinct was boy we could hedge that perfectly  laughter but then i realized the imprudence of that  if we dont sell those securities but in a continued vanguard of transparency the world is aware of these embedded losses do we know how that would impact our reporting  what kind of regime both from a gaap sense and also a public disclosure sense would govern us is it the sale of these longterm assets that is the question or is it the embedded losses that could potentially be the question 
chairman bernanke let me give that a try  just from a pure accounting perspective were on a cost basis so we wouldnt be reporting any capital losses  i think its not clear that the capital losses or gains are very material to anything for the following reasons  so long as our cost of carrywhich is zero on cash plus whatever rates we pay on deposits and so onis below the coupon on the mbs then we would be making positive flow income which is seigniorage to the treasury from an income perspective unless we get to about 8 percent shortterm ratesi think thats the number that was calculated in an earlier meetingwell actually be making money in some sense on these transactions which will then be reflected in payments to the treasury so i think from that perspective the politics is okay 
if we sell a lot of assets then we have to realize the losses  that probably has not much economic meaning it could have some public relations implications  since were dealing only with appearances and not with actuality one way to deal with that would be to try to sell assets that are in the money first or pair them with assets that are in losses  that would be one way to sell assets without realizing net losses   
the final comment i would make is that ive had some discussions with the treasury about this because well be returning to the treasury very high levels of seigniorage over the next few years i think there would be some basis for withholding some of those earnings to augment our capital so that if we do have losses wed be able to absorb them  those are some of the considerations would brian or anyone like to add to that 
mr lacker a capital buffer for us 
chairman bernanke yes absolutely 
mr lacker above our statutory 
chairman bernanke we dont have statutory capital 
mr lacker above what we do now 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr warsh  just as a followup mr chairman i have an accounting question  i take what you say and it makes sense but suppose we were to sell assets that were some subset of the overall pool and substantially similar to assets we didnt sell  even though were in this cost accounting regime i wondered whether or not some more explicit imputed loss would be attributed if not in the consolidated financial statements then in the balance sheet  if we were in the world of a real bank and those unsold assets were similar then youd be stuck with that problem  but again i dont know if from a government gaap perspective thats a real accounting problem or if from a political economy or transparency perspective that begs the question 
chairman bernanke im no accounting expert but because we buy and sell assets all the time and it doesnt affect our cost basis accounting i cant imagine that that would have a direct implication 
governor duke 
ms duke  there is a reason why we dont mark them to market and ive read it and i cant remember what it was 
chairman bernanke well this may be it  laughter did anyone have any concerns or comments  president plosser and president fisher noted the issue on penalty rates but did anyone have any other issues about the proposal to reduce the two auction facilities any other comments or observations  president lacker 
mr lacker id just like to second the notion that the minimum bid rate is a policy parameter that we set and i fail to see why an auction would be inconsistent with raising that to a penalty rate and its a little odd that the term structure is inverted for those funds 
chairman bernanke yes i actually have some sympathy for this view and the only thing that worries me a bit at this juncture is that its kind of a funny time to be changing the structure of the auction when were in the process of winding it down  but i think that arguably we could have had a higher minimum bid rate earlier on 
mr plosser just to follow up with that i appreciate that comment  i think what that should suggest to us is that the staff could begin to pursue how to think about a more permanent longerterm life for the taf  this is an issue that needs to be grappled with so that in the future we dont find ourselves having this same debate 
chairman bernanke absolutely my understanding is that in order to have the taf as an ongoing facility even in reserve we would have to do a rulemaking  is that correct 
mr madigan i believe thats correct mr chairman 
chairman bernanke i believe thats right scott 
mr alvarez yes thats right  in fact we committed to putting the proposal out for comment before making the taf a permanent facility 
chairman bernanke okay we would do a rulemaking for comment  that would be an excellent opportunity to make any revisions to the structure for our permanent facility 
we do need to vote to ratify open market operations 
mr kohn so moved 
chairman bernanke any opposed   no response  okay thank you if everyone is okay with it why dont we turn now to the economic outlook and the presentation will be by dave stockton and nathan sheets  dave 
mr stockton thank you mr chairman  it was with some dismay that i 
listened to you at jackson hole last month wonder out loud whether the fomc might 
actually improve its lot by seeking guidance from astrological forecasts a proposal 
that i assume was motivated by your experience with the analysis of the staff  i think 
weve shown ourselves to be appropriately eclectic in the tools that we have 
employed over timea necessary reflection of our admittedly vast ignorance about 
many important economic relationships  however my colleagues and i want to draw 
the line at studying planetary alignment tarot cards or the entrails of chickens  
laughter of course i recognize that at least a few of you probably view consulting 
the entrails of a chicken and consulting an expectationsaugmented phillips curve to 
be observationally equivalent laughter 

in any event i would like to argue this afternoon that the sizable revisions that we have made to our forecast this round did not reflect a reinterpretation of celestial events but rather resulted as is always the case from a dispassionate and reasoned examination of flawed data through the lens of imperfect models  what we took away from that examination was a view that the economy is expanding at present and with more vigor than we had previously anticipated  indeed the news on spending and production has been noticeably better than we expected just six weeks ago 
one prominent area in that regard has been the housing sector  home sales and 
housing starts have been moving up fairly steadily since the spring and have 
continued to outstrip our expectations by an appreciable margin  inventories of 
unsold new homes have now been worked down to a very low level  and house 
prices which had fallen steeply and steadily since 2007 turned up in the second 
quarter in a fairly wide range of measures  expectations of house prices going 
forward also have improved according to the respondents to the michigan survey and
 readings from futures on house prices 

we still see difficulties ahead for housing in coming quarters especially as a 
pickup in foreclosurerelated inventories puts renewed downward pressure on prices  
but to better balance the risks in our forecast in light of the more favorable incoming 
data we have a shallower decline in house prices in coming quarters and an earlier upturn than we had previously projected  accompanying this improvement we now expect a somewhat faster recovery in construction activity though to a level that by the end of 2011 is still well below those that prevailed prior to the downturn 
elsewhere in the household sector consumer spending also has exceeded our expectations even abstracting from the sizable boost that has been provided by the cashforclunkers program  much though not all of the surprise in nonmotor vehicle outlays came in the form of a jump in retail control spending in august  we are inclined to discount some of that strength because the data are noisy and the underlying fundamentals remain so weak  but still it was a positive innovation and we have raised our forecast for the growth of real pce in the second half by  percentage point to an annual rate of 1 percent 
likewise business equipment spending has exceeded our earlier forecast real es now looks poised to post a small increase on net in the second half in contrast to the roughly 5 percent annual rate decline that we had projected in the august greenbook supporting the somewhat firmer tone of the recent data survey measures of business sentiment have improved as well  that said we certainly arent hearing anything that would suggest an imminent and powerful resurgence in capital spending and we dont expect the growth in equipment spending to pick up appreciably until a recovery in final sales becomes more firmly established toward the middle of next year 
for some time an easing of inventory liquidation has been a central element in our expectation that aggregate activity would turn up in the second half of this year  and that process appears to be in train  indeed revised data now show that businesses made deeper reductions in stocks through midyear than previously reported and with the final sales picture having brightened some the inventory situation has become more comfortable  that is certainly the case in the motor vehicle sector where production is now being lifted to restore depleted stocks  but inventorysales ratios are off their peaks in a reasonably wide swath of industries and a fairly broadbased pickup in factory output has occurred in the past couple of monthsan uptrend that we think will be extended in coming months in light of indications that order flows have been improving 
in addition to the implications of the stronger incoming data a number of other important factors conditioning our projection have improved as well  most notably the stock market is about 5 percent above the levels anticipated at the time of the august greenbook and longerterm interest rates are somewhat lower  the path of crude oil prices is several dollars a barrel under the trajectory built into our prior forecast and as nathan will discuss in more detail the incoming data and outlook for foreign activity have strengthened further  
putting all of these factors together we are now projecting real gdp to grow at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second half of this year about 1 percentage points faster than anticipated in our august forecast  growth is then expected to pick up to 3 percent next year an upward revision of  percentage point  we project a further acceleration to 4 percent in 2011 
while that acceleration is a bit more pronounced than in our previous forecast the basic contour of the projected recovery is still being shaped by factors that we have been citing for some time now  housing begins a modest upturn the inventory cycle provides a boost to production financial strains continue to gradually ease and the drag from negative wealth effects diminishes  as sales production and employment then begin to firm activity benefits further from usual multiplieraccelerator effects and improving household and business confidence 
although growth rates of 3 to 4 percent seem pretty solid especially by recent standards i would still characterize our projected recovery as tepid  in our forecast real gdp doesnt exceed the previous peak it reached in early 2008 until the final quarter of 2010 the longest such episode in the postwar period  even a year from now we expect the unemployment rate to be in the neighborhood of 9 and 9 percent and two years from now in the neighborhood of 8 percent still nearly 3 percentage points above our estimate of the nairu 
one important reason that we anticipate such a modest pace of recovery is that businesses and households are expected to remain cautious in lifting production hiring and spending in response to a gradually improving economic and financial environment  but ill admit that this forecast depends heavily on judgment calls about how to taper off the substantial negative residuals that have emerged in our spending equations over the past year or so  and there isnt a lot of science to guide those judgment calls 
an important upside risk to the projection is that recovery could exhibit greater upward momentum than we currently project  this isnt merely a prospective concern since march broader financial conditions have improved faster than we had anticipated and it now appears that economic activity is turning up earlier and with somewhat greater vigor than we had expected  as weve seen in recent months better financial and economic conditions can feed off each other in a virtuous cycle with further positive effects on sentiment and spending just as they fed off each other in a negative manner on the way down  should that pattern continue we could be looking at a noticeably stronger economy over the next two years than we are currently projecting we illustrated some of these selfreinforcing dynamics in the vshaped recovery scenario included in the greenbook 
of course we also see sizable counterbalancing risks to the downside of our projection while i suspect that it is an acquired taste i actually enjoy perusing old greenbooks those from 2002 make for some interesting reading  early that year we were surprised by how well aggregate activity was holding up after the terrible shock of september 11  not only did it appear that activity was getting a lift from the end of an inventory cycle but final sales were coming in above expectations purchasing managers were reporting stronger order books and consumer sentiment was improving  the staff projection called for a noticeable acceleration of activity into 2003 but as the year progressed activity did not continue to accelerate and it became clear that sour business sentiment continuing pessimism and a lingering capital overhang were restraining the expansion by more than we had thought would be the case there was so to speak a failure to launch 
there is similarly a clear risk that the present improvement in activity will not transition into the modest acceleration that we are projecting but rather will stall out at more meager rates of economic growth  despite the improvement in many aspects of financial market functioning credit conditions remain tight and overall financial headwinds could prove stiffer than we have assumed in this forecast  moreover the response of businesses and particularly households to the financial shock could prove larger and more durable than we have incorporated in our forecast  we illustrated one aspect of that concern with an alternative simulation incorporating a much higher saving rate than in the baseline forecast  if the economy fails to develop further upward momentum then it would not be difficult to imagine giving back some of the recent gains registered in financial markets and experiencing a new wave of concern about the condition of banks balance sheets with consequent effects on prospective aggregate demand and output 
while both the upside and downside risks to our projection for real activity loom large and seem plausible i dont view the staff forecast as an average of two more likely outcomesa boom and a stall  i think the most probable outcome remains one of gradual recovery but the probability distribution covering these outcomes seems pretty flat to me  moreover even if a gradual recovery comes to pass it will undoubtedly be characterized by fits and starts rather than the relatively smooth acceleration that we are forecasting  and that will add to the difficulties of distinguishing among these three possibilities for some time to come 
let me now turn to inflation where we have made only modest adjustments to our forecast this round we have revised up our estimate of total pce price inflation in the current quarter by about  percentage point to an annual rate of nearly 3 percent but lowered our fourthquarter forecast by  percentage point to 1 percent this pattern of revision largely reflects some sharperthanexpected increases that have been posted by retail gasoline prices which we expect will be mostly retraced in coming months given the fallback in crude oil prices  food prices have surprised us to the downside and early crop reports suggest that an ample harvest will likely hold down farm prices and with a lag retail food prices in coming quarters the august reading on core cpi was a handful of basis points above our expectation and that along with somewhat firmer prices for medical services in the ppi led us to mark up our currentquarter forecast of core pce prices by  percentage point to 1 percent  we are projecting core inflation to edge down to a 1 percent pace in the fourth quarter 
in response to the higher levels of resource utilization that we are showing in this greenbook we nudged up our core inflation projection by 01 percentage point in 2010 but the basic contour of the projection remains unchanged  we continue to believe that the very wide margin of slack in the economy will put further downward pressure on inflation but that this downward pressure will be tempered by relatively stable inflation expectations core pce price inflation is expected to recede from a pace of 14 percent this year to 11 percent in 2010 and 1 percent in 2011  total pce inflation is expected to move up from 1 percent this year to 1 percent in 2010 as food and energy prices turn back up and then is projected to drop back to 1 percent in 2011 close to the pace of core inflation  nathan will continue our presentation 
mr sheets the global recovery that began in asia now looks to be more broadbased than it appeared in august  recent data indicate that activity abroad expanded in the second quarter at a 1 percent pace a full percentage point faster than we had expected with positive surprises in both emergingmarket and advanced economies  this outcomealong with improving data on manufacturing and trade further healing in financial markets and the stronger us outlookhas led us to revise up our projection of foreign economic growth  percentage point in the second half this year and  percentage point in 2010 
the emergingmarket economies are likely to lead the recovery with growth averaging near 5 percent through the forecast period  activity in the advanced foreign economies should also pick up steam rising from about a 2 percent rate during the second half of this year to over 3 percent in 2011  the nearterm global expansion is supported by a turn in the inventory cycle improvements in business and consumer sentiment and the ongoing effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus 
our forecast seeks to balance two competing considerations  on the one hand the remarkable depth of the recent recession and very low levels of resource utilization provide scope for a snapback in activity as improving conditions unleash pentup demand  on the other hand strong headwinds from lingering stresses in the financial sector weak labor market conditions and expiring fiscal stimulus are likely to restrain growth over the next two years particularly in the advanced economies  in response to these considerations we have penciled in a recovery that envisions foreign growth that is well above trend but we also anticipate that significant slack will persist through the end of the forecast period 
in china recent readings on industrial production investment and retail sales point to continued strong expansion  following new measures by the chinese authorities to moderate credit growth bank lending slowed significantly in july and august however the authorities have issued assurances that their policies will remain accommodative until a sustainable recovery is at hand  until such time the authorities are likely to continue to struggle to strike the right balance between constraining speculative behavior and maintaining an appropriately stimulative stance of policy  as such it remains to be seen whether the chinese authorities will achieve a smooth dismount from the extraordinary stimulus implemented in the first half of the year growth elsewhere in the region continues to be buoyed by demand from china but domestic stimulus and rebounding private spending are also lending support 
going forward economic growth in emerging asia should remain strong at around 6 percent through the forecast period  but key risks include the possibility that external demand may be slow to recover or that stimulative monetary conditions coupled with the relatively favorable outlook for the region may trigger unsustainable increases in asset prices  
the contraction in euroarea gdp during the second quarter was much smaller than expected as the german and french economies showed positive growth supported by improved export performance  in addition automobile purchases surged as consumers responded to government incentives  with these incentives now winding down we expect euroarea consumption to weaken again but a turnaround in inventories further gains in exports and rebounding business sentiment should fuel economic growth in the region of around 1 percent in the second half  thereafter we see a moderate recovery taking hold with gdp expanding at a 23 percent pace but headwinds from weak labor market conditions and stresses in the financial sector will constrain growth going forward 
recent signs also point to a nearterm rebound among our north american neighbors after several quarters of contraction canadian economic growth is expected to rebound to 2 percent in the second half of this year as improved conditions in the auto sector fuel a rise in exports and a strengthening in domestic demand  the hardhit mexican economy which over the past year has contracted nearly 10 percent its largest decline on record now appears to be reviving as well  mexican auto production was up sharply in august and business sentiment is rising  in line with these improvements as well as a reversal of economic drag from the swine flu outbreak the mexican economy should begin to recover in the second half of this year in 2010 and 2011 both canada and mexico should benefit from the strengthening expansion in the united states 
we expect that headline cpi inflation in the major foreign economies will remain muted through the forecast period with persistent slack preventing inflation from breaking out on the upside and wellanchored inflation expectations keeping inflation from dipping much on the downside  in this environment the major central banks are assumed to leave policy rates at their current low levels for quite some time  the bank of canada has made a conditional commitment to keep its policy rate at 25 basis points through the second quarter of 2010  as such we expect the bank to wait at least until the second half of next year to begin its liftoff  the bank of england which last month increased its assetpurchase program by 50 billion with mervyn king voting for an even larger increase will likely refrain from tightening until early 2011  and we believe that the ecb will also wait until 2011 to begin raising policy rates 
the broad dollar has declined 1 percent since your last meeting with an appreciation against the pound and the peso only partially offsetting a sizable depreciation against the euro and the yen  we project that the dollar will remain on a modest downward trajectory depreciating at an annual rate of about 2 percent over the next two years 
turning to the us external sector nominal trade data for july pointed to a sharp rebound in both imports and exports  in line with these data as well as the projected bounceback in automotive trade and the strengthening of us and foreign demand more generally we now expect imports and exports both to expand at roughly a 20 percent pace in the third quarter  thereafter rising foreign economic growth and stimulus from recent and projected future dollar depreciation should fuel export growth at an average annual rate of 8 percent through 2011 while imports are expected to grow just a touch more slowly 
beginning with the fourth quarter we have raised our projections for import and export growth roughly 3 percentage points relative to the august greenbook  although this revision in part reflects the stronger outlook for us and foreign activity we have also factored in a more aggressive judgmental rebound in trade  as of the second quarter real imports were down 20 percent from their previous peak and real exports were down 15 percent this cyclical downturn was much larger than our models predicted  with the improved global outlook we are now writing down a bounceback that is also much larger than our models suggest but which we believe better matches the behavior of trade during past economic recoveries 
taken together net exports are expected to swing from a positive contribution to us gdp growth of 16 percentage points in the second quarter to a negative contribution of about  percentage point on average over the forecast period just a bit more negative than in our previous forecast 
in sum we are more confident about the projected recovery abroad than we were in august but much uncertainty remains about its breadth and durability one notable risk is that the boost from the turn in the inventory cycle may prove to be shortlived and that consumption and investment spending may remain sluggish for longer than we now anticipate similarly it is possible that the recovery in global financial markets may have gotten ahead of itself especially given continued balance sheet stresses in major financial institutions  finally with high and rising unemployment in many countries intensified protectionist pressures and increased trade barriers are an ongoing risk as well  thank you and were happy to take your questions 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  are there questions for our colleagues  president plosser  
mr plosser i have a question dave both you and nathan referred to financial headwinds as one of the downsides or stresses to growth going forward  that phrase has come up a lot over the last couple of years as financial markets have improved i was wondering if i could get a handle on the degree to which financial headwinds affect this forecast compared with the degree that you marked down your earlier forecasts when you also saw headwinds  has the picture changed for you in some way  im not saying that headwinds have necessarily gone away but have they changed given the evolution of the financial markets and if so how and how is that reflected in your forecast  and nathan for the international side the same question 
mr stockton between the august forecast and this forecast there really hasnt been any significant change in our measures of financial stress we havent learned anything more because we havent gotten another senior loan officer survey to gauge bank lending 
mr plosser since last spring though 
mr stockton but since last spring things have changed  weve tried to be symmetrical in our response to the deterioration  as you know we were marking down our forecast by more than would be suggested by the standard interest rate wealth and exchange rate channels as things have improved weve taken some of those negative addfactors out of our spending equations and allowed spending to come back more closely to the equations than was the case in our forecast in march when we had very substantial negative adds going out through the end of the forecast horizon but not really lessening very much over the course of this year as things have improved were interpreting some of the upward revisions that weve made to the forecast which are very substantial for the second half of this year as a reflection of improved overall financial conditions some of which operate through our modelthe stock market interest rates the exchange ratebut others of which operate through channels that the model doesnt incorporate such as through tight bank lending and other kinds of constraints  i dont have a quantitative number that i can just pull out of the air here but id say a noticeable fraction of that improvement in the incoming data probably reflects the fact that were not getting as much restraint coming from those financial conditions as we had previously thought 
mr plosser well how much of the improvement of your forecast in some sense is reflected in the diminishing of the negative addfactors that you had been putting in before and how much of it is really the model  i think you probably gave me as close to an answer on that as im going to get  laughter 
mr stockton you may recall that as we showed in a number of greenbooks we were consulting some reducedform models that incorporated measures of financial stress  we were looking at correlating those measures of financial stress with residuals in the frbus equation theyve generally moved in a more favorable direction not uniformly but generally in a more favorable direction  the reason its so difficult to be very precise is that the magnitudes of that improvement differ a lot by those various measures and various models  i think that if you look at whats happened in the second half of this year and given that it hasnt all just occurred as an end of an inventory cycle were seeing some better final sales as well it reflects an improvement in these financial channels 
mr plosser okay thank you nathan 
mr sheets just briefly id say that there have been probably three major factors that have driven the upward revisions to our forecast since the march greenbook which was the trough one is the very surprising rebound in emerging asia  economic growth in emerging asia in the second quarter was at an annual rate of  145 percent theres no way that we would have seen that coming  in particular the fiscal stimulus in china came on much more quickly and powerfully than we expected a second factor thats operating on our forecast particularly for north american countriesmexico and canadais the markup in the us which has a very powerful effect and to some extent the markup in emerging asia  the third major factor has been the much more rapid improvement in global financial conditions than we would have expected so its one of the three major factors  im not sure exactly how we want to allocate it across those three factors but thats roughly the order of magnitude 
one other thought that i want to articulate is that i look at these headwinds as being a factor thats weighing on economic growth and affecting our central forecast but in addition i look at it as a downside riskthese headwinds may prove to be more debilitating than what we factored into our forecast  therefore because of these headwinds we have a slower pace of foreign growth particularly in the advanced economies than we would otherwise we also have a distribution of risk thats more skewed to the downside than would be the case without them 
mr plosser just one clarification would you characterize the improvement in financial conditions that weve seen outside the us as of roughly the same order of magnitude that we witnessed in the us 
mr sheets yes 
mr plosser and would you say that theres not a great differential between whats going on in the us and whats going on in the countries that are the most important for our growth  in other words would you say that theyve improved by roughly the same order of magnitude that we have 
mr sheets i would say yes by a similar order of magnitude but with the footnote that perhaps the headwinds in some of the emergingmarket economies are not as great because their financial institutions have not been as affected by this crisis 
mr plosser thank you very much 
chairman bernanke governor kohn you had a twohander 
mr kohn i was going to make the last point that nathan just made  we heard it from the bis i think that some of the emergingmarket economies felt that their financial markets were coming back very quickly and inflows of capital were resuming and if anything they were beginning to get concerned about rising asset prices i guess this applies to australia as well to the emergingmarket economies in asia 
chairman bernanke thank you  president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  dave this is probably more of an observation than a question the alternative scenarios often present very interesting possibilities and two that caught my eye this time were one the earlier liftoff and two greater disinflation  these are diametrically opposed  on the one hand early liftoff has the inflation rate going to 28 percent in 2013 whereas greater disinflation has it at 0 percent during that time frame  looking at the confidence intervals theyre both outside of 90 percent during those time periods so i take it you dont see either of those as particularly likely  but i guess the question is  when can we know that we can take one of these off the table what type of explanation would you be looking for there 
mr stockton  i suspect it will be a while before that occurs  i think what were trying to illustrate is that thinking about the evolution of inflation expectations going forward is critical and we dont have a very good grasp in the current environment of what might be driving those inflation expectations 
now the accelerationist phillips curvethe faster greater disinflation scenario basically follows pretty closely the kind of disinflation you might get out of a backwardlooking phillips curve that fits the data though not perfectly over the past with some reasonable degree of accuracy  but implicit in that is a very substantial decline in inflation expectations  so the staff has been surprised that weve gone through a year in which the unemployment rate has risen as rapidly as it has and weve really seen no signs that inflation expectations are breaking to the downside 
on the other hand theres the earlier liftoff  a number of you have expressed concerns that given the current setting of policy or the size of the balance sheet inflation expectations could be unleashed to the upside  so that scenario considers what happens if we get a faster recovery in a world in which policy is not being tightened aggressively  specifically could you get some significant upward shift in inflation expectations it seems possible 
i think youre right that we dont see either of those two extreme outcomes as the most likely but i dont see any alternative other than to monitor very carefully whats happening on the inflation expectation side and going forward obviously to look at all of the price and wage data and so forth that would be important  but id consider expectations to be pretty central to that process 
mr evans okay thanks very well done 
chairman bernanke thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart i have a question for nathan regarding the dollar and it relates to your tracking the tone of the market over the intermeeting period  yes the dollar has stabilized in the last few days but two or three weeks ago it was under pretty severe pressure  i know its a tremendous exaggeration but one begins to think about the dollar in a rout of some kindthe markets really selling off stronglyand at least in theory that could produce some response on our part how do you follow and think about the dollar and as i call it the tone of the market are you in touch with people in the market or are we just tracking it more quantitatively 
mr sheets let me give some background  from july of 2008 through early march of this year the broad index of the dollar appreciated by about 20 percent  since early march the dollar has given back about twothirds of that strength  the story that weve toldand i think it continues to be the most compelling storyis that that appreciation of the dollar was driven by a sharp increase in risk aversion and risk appetite as people moved en masse into treasuries then over the last six months as conditions have improved theres been an unwinding of some of those riskrelated flows and the dollar has accordingly depreciated  weve also seen rather marked appreciations of a number of emerging market economy exchange rates which would be consistent with the story that folks are more comfortable taking on risk 
now specifically over the intermeeting period we continue to hear this story about increased risk aversion a lot of attention was paid to the bilateral rate with the eurothe dollar did fall quite a bit over the intermeeting period against the eurobut there was an offset to that due to an appreciation against the pound and against the mexican peso  so all in all the overall move was relatively limited  nevertheless tone is tone and we continue to pay attention to it  i have to say that i firmly believe that the dollar is traded in a market and sometimes its going to go up and sometimes its going to go down 
ultimately if the united states pursues sound policies in my view there will be attractive investment opportunities here and that will support the dollar over the medium term  but its our responsibility to make sure that those sound and strong policies are being put in place so all in all im not too concerned so far  but its something that we have to monitor very closely and we need to pay attention to what were hearing  why is the dollar falling is it a lack of confidence in us policymakers particularly on the fiscal side you hear murmurs from time to time that thats a concern  so the fiscal situation is certainly something thats weighing on the dollar but why is it going down its the tone of us policies and its imperative that us policies be able to deliver an array of investment opportunities so that well be attractive for international investors 
chairman bernanke nathan i think its worth pointing out though that the behavior of the yields on treasuries is a little bit inconsistent with this whole story and gives us something of a puzzle 
mr sheets indeed 
chairman bernanke president fisher 
mr fisher mr chairman if i can i just want to compliment the presenters  over the last five years the quality of these presentations gets better and better  i particularly want to tip my hatno offense daveto nathan because the understanding of these global interlinkageswithout taking anything away from your predecessorsis far more erudite than it was before i much appreciate it 
my question is about productivity i would expect that globalization would have an impact on enhancing the productivity of our own economy here at home and i deduce from listening to my corporate interlocutors that indeed they have been driving to achieve greater productivity as they have worked their way through this recession  i infer from the numbers i get from my staff that indeed productivity has held up rather well throughout this recession and in fact perhaps better than it has in previous us recessions  so my question is  how does this affect your outlook for the pace of recovery and for inflation if my assumption is correct 
mr stockton in terms of the productivity in the united states we have been surprised in the first half of this year by its strength  our interpretation was largely that as things started to collapse late last year firms were a bit slow to cut payrolls  even though those cuts were huge they were in fact fairly modest relative to the size of the output declines so we got a little cyclical downswing in productivity  since the first half of this year firms have been exceedingly aggressive at cutting costs and extracting higher productivity gains  in this forecast were interpreting that as firms squeezing their work forces currently very hard and as being unlikely to let up quickly on that but we do think theres going to be a gradual return  productivity is now probably above what we think the structural trend would be and there will be some return to that structural trend slowly through a slowdown in the growth of productivity going forward firms wont be able to continue to extract the 4 5 and 6 percent increases in productivity that theyve gotten in recent quarters its likely to slow down to more like 1 percent 
thats an important risk in the outlook because its clear that if in fact we were to have another year or two of gains in productivity that average close to 4 percent we would be looking at something that looked more like a jobless recovery  even though gdp growth might look reasonably well sustained it would be with less employment growth and a higher unemployment rate than is incorporated in the baseline forecast  why havent we put that into the baseline forecast at this point i think thats a serious issue and one that were going to have to confront if in fact productivity stays as high as it has been recently  i guess were just reluctant at this point to interpret whats happened over the course of the past two years as a big positive supply shock to the us economy its possible theres some sort of xefficiency operating where businesses are under incredible pressure and theyll learn to do things differently and theyll continue to learn to do things more effectively in the future  but right now i think were staying agnostic about whether this is a negative or positive supply shock  we resisted marking down our potential output a whole lot when the crisis first began and people were talking about a big negative supply shock in retrospect i think that still was a pretty good call but were also reluctant to think that were going to get a big increase in sustained productivity growth going forwardbut its possible and i think a jobless recovery thats generated through both faster productivity and maybe somewhat longer work weeks for workers is a real risk to the outlook 
mr fisher thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you other questions  no response okay seeing none why dont we begin our economic goround and president lockhart youre the leadoff hitter 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  first i have just a quick comment to dave stockton because of our trade policy chicken entrails could back up in georgia and if you want to change your policy on that we can help  laughter 
mr stockton ive got to take a look i guess 
mr lockhart much like the greenbook my views have moved in the direction of greater optimism since the last committee meeting in august  the incoming data have been a little stronger than were anticipated then  at this late september juncture i think the picture can be characterized as improving but still with very mixed vital signs and the outlook is somewhat more optimistic but tempered by awareness that this is an economy powered by a large number of government supports  i agree with all who are declaring that a technical recovery is under way but it is a tentative recovery not well established  even with the improving data i think there is substantial uncertainty around the question of whether the recovery has its own legs or is propelled by transitory government programs  governor tarullo in the last meeting talked about a relapse scenario i see the economy as still vulnerable to relapse 
over the last two weeks our sixth district contacts provided a lot of support for this view of the current reality sixth district realtors and homebuilders reported that the firsttime homebuyer subsidy noticeably boosted new home sales and construction of moderately priced properties the cashforclunkers program provided a big lift to southeast auto dealers and cut deeply into new car inventories in response to the boards request our regional executives contacted six state budget officials  they told us that the stimulus money as intended has helped support construction activity but it represents spending that would have been cut or funded by running down rainy day funds this input supports the view that stimulus spending is mainly eliminating a negative in the outlook 
in this contact cycle involving directors and other business leaders we tried to probe their sense of factors critical to transitioning from government support to sustained growth based on private demand our business contacts said that the inventory drawdown is slowing but may not be followed by an increase even as sales increase  as the chairman pointed out at the last meeting in the near term inventories dont have to rise to improve economic growth they just have to fall more slowly nonetheless were hearing claims on the part of some businesspeople of permanent adjustments to inventory requirements and businesses  apart from a modest rise in backtoschool spending general merchandise retailers reported continuing restrained consumer demand  transport firms reported very little in the way of increased activity and the sixth district survey of purchasing managers reveals a drop in new orders and production after more promising numbers in july 
as regards employment we heard that layoffs have subsided but there is no indication yet that firms anticipate hiring  in summary the nascent optimism expressed by my contacts just before the last fomc meeting has been supplanted with unease over the economy as the influence of public support programs diminishes 
we are revising up our thirdquarter gdp estimate and are inclined to do the same for the fourth quarter but in comparison with the greenbook i remain much less bullish about 2010 and 2011 there are reasons at this juncture to question whether the economy will have healed enough for a significant expansion of private demand  i would cite several factors likely to weigh on the economy through the medium term  high unemployment cautious business investment diminished consumer finance the potential drag on the banking system from commercial real estate the slow repair of the banking system and slowmoving adjustments such as intersectoral labor movements 
regarding prices the incoming data show disinflation to be more persistent and more broadbased than the atlanta bank put in its last forecast submission  i think these disinflation trends bear watching but at the moment i still judge inflation risks to be roughly balanced 
as regards growth the incoming data have clearly been more positive and i would judge the balance of risks to be more balanced than was my view in august  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  business conditions in the third district continue to indicate generally sluggish activity and nonresidential investment remains soft  nevertheless a number of positive trends have begun to emerge  our september business outlook survey index of general activity came in quite a bit stronger than it did in august  the gain was primarily driven by increases in shipments its hard to parse out what part of this increase in shipments was due to drawn down inventories and what part was new production  most likely it was some of both  this rise in the index seems consistent with the general signals of improvement in manufacturing coming from other regions of the country even richmond 
prices paid and received by manufacturers in our region seem to have firmed a bit as well the bos current prices paid and current prices received indexes have all been positive for the last two months  in fact the index for prices expected to be paid six months from now will increase to a number over 40 a very high number  manufacturers thus seem to be more attuned to the prospects of higher prices than falling prices  these data might mitigate some of our concerns about the risk of deflation or deflationary expectations taking hold 
as in the nation as a whole employment has continue to fall in our threestate area though the pace of decline has lessened somewhat as it has in the nation  the bos future employment index rose in september and has been positive for five consecutive months  evidence is mounting that the employment level in the threestate area is at or near the bottom 
overall conditions in the third district look slightly better than they were six weeks ago and signs are pointing to a gradual strengthening of economic activity in the coming months  on the national level the data we have received since our last meeting are indicative of an economy where recovery is gradually taking hold and it now appears that the worst of this recession is quite likely behind us we are in my view in the midst of that transition period from contraction to expansion the level of employment is still depressed but given the trends in jobloss and jobfinding rates it seems to me that we can begin to expect employment to increase and growth to return in the near term  the signs of financial stress that also concerned us so much this time last year have greatly abated as weve discussed 
while these indicators are not all back to their precrisis levels they are about where i would expect given the current state of the economy and economic conditions more broadly  the bottom line is that current economic conditions are much better than they were and they are better than what we and many privatesector forecasters were expecting just a few months ago  they underpin a substantial upward revision in nearterm gdp forecasts both from the greenbook and from many privatesector forecasters 
however i remain highly skeptical of the staffs forecast regarding inflation which by and large has been unaffected by the upward revisions to growth in their forecast  in particular i continue to see stronger inflationary pressures over the next few years than is implicit in the greenbook forecast many other forecasters also see more inflation than is in the greenbook  for example the greenbook 2010 cpi forecast is below both the average and the median cpi forecast among the fiftytwo forecasters in the september blue chip consensus  i think we need to consider seriously that there are upside risks to inflation particularly to the staffs forecast of inflation when we think about policy 
let me discuss why i have some concerns about the inflation outlook first its quite clear from the staffs writeup that forecasted inflation paths depend importantly on inflation expectations as dave stockton mentioned  with those expectations well anchored estimates of economic slack going forward become virtually the sole determinant of the path of inflation in the forecast  the forecast anchors those expectations at 2 percent which is lower than the readings of inflation expectations that we have been receiving  in particular while they seem to be anchored longerterm expectations of inflation as measured by surveys are still in the 3 percent range my own view on longerterm inflation expectations is closer to the publics as reflected in those various surveys than the staffs 
the dependence of the staffs inflation outlook on inflation expectations remaining anchored over the forecast horizon brings to the fore my second concern with the greenbook outlook on inflation in my way of thinking expectations of future inflation will ultimately depend on the publics expectation about the future path of monetary stimulus  in the greenbook forecast the funds rate is held constant at least through the end of 2011 and probably into 2012 while the public seems to believe well be raising the funds rate by the middle of next year  clearly there is more monetary stimulus built into the greenbook forecast than the public currently expects if we were to endow the public with this knowledge i seriously doubt that inflation expectations will stay near 2 percent  thus the greenbook assumption of longerterm expectations being anchored at 2 percent over the forecast horizon seems to me at odds with this divergence between the markets expectation of policy and the proposed policy path in the greenbook inflation expectations could rise in this context and could easily overwhelm the effects of economic slack that the greenbook relies so heavily upon for its forecast 
my third concern is the fact that the model underlying the greenbook forecast does not appear to depend explicitly on forecasts of liquidity or other quantities in the banking system such as forecasts of excess reserves required reserves or loans and despite the results of the consultation with banks that we heard about earlier regarding the high reserve balances and the simulation exercise it seems only a matter of time before those huge reserves in our banking system begin to flow out into the economy particularly with growth rates at the level that they are and that time may come sooner than many people think given the upward revisions in our forecast needless to say this outflow will not have an immediate effect on current inflation but expectations of inflation may become more sensitive to such a rapid increase in liquidity  nevertheless the outflow will undoubtedly create the preconditions for an eventual rise in inflation expectations and inflation  we need to be prepared to soak up those excess reserves as weve been discussing 
of course knowing when to raise rates and when to reverse course is always a challenge but it will be more difficult in this complex environment as we are near the zero bound  that brings me to my fourth concern  while i believe that we have a range of tools to control excess reserves and reserves in general including interest rates on reserves asset sales and some of the other techniques we talked about this afternoon i think we still have some work to do to figure out what the right metrics are that we need to be looking at that will signal to us when the time is right for instance as i noted in my question to bill english i find it curious that treasury yields fell over this intermeeting period given the betterthanexpected economic data  a staff memo on high reserve balances noted that at least one respondent adjusted their reserve balances downward and another was getting ready to make adjustments  could these yields be a result of downward pressure from cash equivalents to induce reserve demand to equal reserve supply yields abroad fell too but foreign central banks are also providing high levels of liquidity  what implications does this have for the increase in reserves that will follow on the heels of our increased mbs purchases what implications does it have for inflation expectations  is a small rise in the inflation compensation in fiveyear forwards over the past few weeks a precursor to that in the near future 
my final concern has to do with the reduction in the treasurys sfp balances and how this committee plans to address that  the staff estimates that the reduction in the sfp program will add about 200 billion in excess reserves to our balance sheet  if we choose not to sterilize this expansion in reserves i think this additional source of stimulus will add upside risks to inflation even if one believes that the reduction in the sfp program is temporary as the balance sheet projections assume there doesnt seem to be any reason for us not to sterilize this increase by reducing our own lsap program when and if the sfp rises againand im not sure we want to encourage it to rise again for that matter from an independence point of viewwe can alter our approaches if we deem it appropriate  the amount of stimulus we apply to the economy should remain the decision of this committee and not be passive or be choices made at the treasury 
the bottom line for me is this  given the amount of stimulus thats in the forecast given the size of the balance sheet and excess reserves given the uncertainty regarding our ability to know when to act i largely see only upside risks to inflation relative to the latest greenbook forecast based on these concerns about the forecasted paths of inflation my views on appropriate policy are fundamentally different from those underlying the policy assumptions in the greenbook maintaining a funds rate so close to zero for so many years in my view can only reignite significant inflation moreover given the lags between policy actions and the surfacing of inflation we will have to act well before inflation pressures become evident  otherwise we will be too late risking both inflation and our credibility  i believe we could have helped our own cause by adopting an explicit inflation target but i fear we have missed the opportunity to advance that initiative when deflation fears were more widespread among the public and congress  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  the change in the greenbook forecast for this meeting was really quite striking  there were marked improvements in consumer spending equipment and software and residential investment for the remainder of the year and it is notable to me that the improvement is carried through over the forecast horizon  the turn in housing for example extends beyond the expiration of the homebuyer credit  i havent been at this long but i havent seen many revisions this large  it strikes me that they are well supported by the data weve seen since the last meeting almost every indicator has surprised to the upside and taken together they paint a picture that looks more like the beginning of the recovery than an economy trying to find where the bottom is 
there are abundant reasons for caution however as one would expect at this stage in the business cycle perhaps chief among these is the labor market which does look like its trying to find a bottom we have seen definite improvement in the rate of change in employment but i would feel more comfortable if the weekly claims numbers were falling a bit faster  i think uncertainty about the labor market poses obvious questions about how hardy consumer spending is going to be in the next few quarters uncertainty about compensation growth poses similar questions the greenbook has marked up its forecast here as well based on the notion that the weakness weve seen represents a onetime level adjustment and that strikes me as quite plausible but it will be great to see that in the numbers 
the picture in the fifth district is broadly similar to the national outlook and i describe it as signs of improvement tempered by pervasive caution  our manufacturing index which five months ago was the first among the regional surveys to venture into positive territory held steady this month at 14  of particular note the employment component moved into positive territory for the first time this month as did expectations of manufacturing employment six months ahead while our services index remained in negative territory also overall it has also shown some recent recovery especially on the retail side where sales revenue and shopper traffic showed big improvements  service sector wages both retail and nonretail also showed their first positive reading since the beginning of the recession   
the anecdotal information from around the district also has a cautious tone amid signs of improvement  suppliers of auto components report a significant uptick in industry demand  a large packaging manufacturer reported a surprising surge in august sales  other contacts however report delays in investment projects due to uncertainty about the economic and political climate  commercial real estate continues to soften  contacts expect construction to be lower for the next two years with the exception of the washington area where several federal agencies are embarking on building projects apparently  one large electric utility reports slower hiring because their current workers are staying on rather than retiring as they had planned 
on inflation i agree with the greenbooks assessment that the relative stability in the core is due largely to the stability of expectations  it depends in turn of course on the stability of expectations about future policy as president plosser pointed out and that makes the large discrepancy that he commented on between market expectations and the greenbooks assumption regarding the funds rate something of a problem  personally i think the market expectations are a bit closer to the mark 
whats happening in banking and financial markets since the last meeting is pretty striking too i think at a time when economic reports have generally surprised on the upside interest rates have trended downthe sixmonth rate for example went from 28 basis points to 20 you would have thought that rates would have risen instead in response to the good economic news  bill english was discussing interpretations of this downward shift in the yield curve i would point out we were buying all across the spectrum so the combination of our purchases and quantitative easingsome mix of those twocould easily have been operative 
at our last two meetings id been suggesting that we may start to see quantitative easing effects when our asset purchases completely displace shortterm liquidity borrowing to the banking system  but over the past intermeeting period our asset purchases have been only partially offset by reductions in shortterm borrowing if you take this point of view  our security holdings increased 191 billion and our reserve balances increased 101 billion  and in comparison over the previous intermeeting period our security holdings increased by 149 billion but reserve balances actually shrank  combining the behavior of borrowing with the increase in reserve balances and the decrease in interest rates suggests that we might already be seeing some quantitative easing as a result of our asset purchases 
id note that in the period from february to may of this year we had a similar increase in reserve holdings and a similar decrease in interest ratesthe sixmonth rate for example went from 46 basis points down to 30and at that time bank demand for reserves seemed to be increasing an anecdotal report suggested that preparation for the announcement of the stress test results or the conclusion of the stress test was inducing banks to build up bigger liquidity buffers  this only partially offsetting effect that we might be seeing could occur if some banks are using us for wholesale funding rather than as a source of just getting the reserve balances they need some shortterm borrowing is for up to three months and that means delays in adjustments in response to our asset purchases and for both those reasons banking system borrowings might not shrink dollar for dollar with our asset purchases 
therefore it looks to me as if theres a good chance quantitative easing may have actually begun since the last meeting  but even if that is not true were certain to cross that line soon because the desk has made 131 billion in mbs purchases that havent settled yet and the supplementary financing program is going to run down by about 185 billion  so thats 316 billion in additional reserves even if we dont purchase any more mbs that are going to be added to the banking system 
from my perspective every additional purchase from here on out represents additional monetary stimulus and its as if we were continuing to cut interest rates  if you look at bill englishs first chart its going to take bank reserves well outside of its range over the last year or so now if we were working with interest rates and the fed funds rate were say 1 percent and we had the same macro data up until this meeting that wed seen i have a hard time thinking we would cut rates given the improvement weve just seen in the economy  i realize thats open to debate and we can discuss that  but because of that im not sure how i feel about additional mbs purchases that is whether its a good idea to add that stimulus right now  im looking forward to hearing peoples views about the economy and these mbs purchases  but in any event i think we should avoid making any commitments at this meeting to the amount of asset purchases particularly for our agency mbs  we havent made any public commitment so far  our statements have always said up to and theyve always said that were monitoring the size and composition of our balance sheet and will make adjustments to our credit and liquidity programs as warranted right near the end of the statement  i think we could get to the next meeting and decide additional monetary stimulus is unwarranted and i think in that case we could want to finish up our agency mbs program before we get to the full amount  so thats where i am mr chairman  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  the incoming data since the last meeting give us more confidence that the economy is now recovering from the recession and the second half of this year will have positive economic growth  but i expect nearterm growth to be insufficient to make much progress on the very weak labor markets  most heartening have been clear signals were receiving indicating a bottoming out in housing markets  like many markets boston has seen some increases in housing pricing particularly for homes that are attractive to buyers looking to use the governments firsttime homebuyer tax credit 
the disinflation that the greenbook has been forecasting is being borne out by the data  core pce inflation for the past year is 14 percent significantly below the previous year and well below where most of us expect the inflation rate to settle in the longer run  according to the survey of professional forecasters the mean probability that the core pce inflation is below 1 percent in 2010 is 50 percent with only a 12 percent mean probability attached to a core pce inflation exceeding 24 percent while some market analysts cite the expansion of the federal reserve balance sheet as being inflationary i do not believe that this poses much of a shortrun risk while we do not have recent historical experience in the united states with the effect of rapid growth in the central bank balance sheet the experience in japan is instructive  even with their substantial quantitative easing program the bank of japan has been fighting deflation rather than inflation for the past decade  despite the rapid growth in bank reserves in japan the banking system was shrinking as banks reduced lending to satisfy capital constraints  it seems unlikely that the expansion of the federal reserve balance sheet will have nearterm inflationary implications for reasons similar to those in japan  despite the buildup in us bank reserves bank lending remains constrained and is likely to be capital constrained for some time  thus like the greenbook i expect that lower labor costs and the substantial slack in the economy will continue to generate disinflation and thus over the next two years we will likely be moving further below my inflation target of 2 percent 
 discussions with bankers in new england are consistent with the data showing continuing significant declines in lending  their biggest concern is with commercial real estate loans where falling prices are making banks increasingly reluctant to lend  one very large builder highlighted the fact that although construction costs and the costs of labor have declined those cost reductions have not kept pace with the fall in prices of existing buildings bankers are concerned with how commercial real estate loans will be treated at their next exam  the mounting commercial real estate problems along with nonperforming loans that are growing faster than reserves at many banks make it increasingly unlikely that we will see much improvement in credit availability from banks in the coming year 
while the real economy is improving the robustness of privatesector growth once the government programs wind down is still uncertain and poses additional downside risk  more importantly the unemployment rate is likely to remain uncomfortably high and inflation well below my target for the next several years  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president fisher 
mr fisher mr chairman in the eleventh district retail sales remain anemic  weakness in energy due to lower natural gas prices continues to be a drag on the texas new mexico and louisiana economies and commercial real estate remains mired in significant distress  but there are some positive numbers that have been reported  privatesector jobs grew in july and then pulled back a little bit in august  initial unemployment claims continued to decline there are signs of improvement in the temporary staffing market  reflecting the activity that nathan reported exportsand texas is the largest exporting staterose in july for the second consecutive month theyre up slightly in q2  existing home sales are up through july theres actually a slight pickup in home construction as new home inventory levels stabilize and we have a leading index that was up on all components making positive contributions at the last measurement 
now realizing that it may not be the case that as goes texas so goes the galaxy or so goes the globe still there are some glimpses of sunlight that come through from our anecdotal soundings and from the ceos that i have talked tothe list of which i provide you before every meeting mr chairman  distillate consumption which is strongly correlated with industrial activity has picked up at least slightly  and i note that electricity generation is also up slightly which is a positive  on the consumer side mastercards internal data were positive in terms of sales activity for the week of september 7 for the first time since october 30 2008  the broadcasters report that advertising is creeping back up  in part this is ed whitacres ego theres also political advertising on health care but more generally its getting away from the trial lawyers and the lesser advertisers that we have seen and moving toward more general normal economic activity  the semiconductors report a pickup in demand which i find quite interesting according to texas instruments for example in the first quarter customers actually reduced their original orders by 7 percent  in the second quarter they shipped 31 percent over their original order base which indicates a rush to cover either inventory shortfalls or perhaps demandtheyre not sure which  and as of last night their shipments in the third quarter are exceeding the original orders by 29 percent  and lastly an odd positive to the recession is that walmart reports that pilferage or internal theft is down 20 percent for fear of people losing their jobs 
despite those positive indicators and the aggregate data which we have heard presented by others and at this table i would summarize the mood of my interlocutors as being wary of the purported recovery they see some improvement in the statistics that they read about elsewhere but based on their own experience they doubt them  some cotton to our outlook at the dallas fed which is for a checkmarkshaped recovery with less growth as president lockhart pointed out in 2010 and 2011 than the staff are forecasting here at the board  but i heard from more than i hoped that theyre managing for what i would call a wshaped recovery  and if theyre wrong theyll be relieved more than once i heard what i consider a new management bias described as being based on process improvement or cost takeout or margin repair  this is the kind of nomenclature that now is ubiquitous amongst mckinsey and bain consultants who up until last summer were flogging techniques to enhance topline improvement through pricing power 
our own measure at the dallas fed of global capacity utilization shows record lows  it indicates that for some time incremental demand will be met by utilizing a greater share of existing capital rather than investing in new equipment or buildings  and i cant find a single sector where a leading ceo is budgeting to do anything other than to contain costs and only commit to vital and minimal cap ex in 2010 
so mr chairman thats how it looks from a microeconomic perch  its undoubtedly imperfect but i think its illustrative  theres a disconnect between the way that the women and men who are managing the businesses of the united states view the economy and the aggregate data and i dont know how we will join that disconnect but its clearly there  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke whats the difference between a checkmark recovery and a v recovery 
mr fisher the slope of the right side from my perspective   
chairman bernanke i see 
mr fisher its a nike swoosh laughter  this actually goes to the point that president plosser made and im going to take advantage of your question  of course thank you for asking we are eliminating a lot of negatives as president plosser said  were beginning to accentuate some positives  we do have a snapback  we had a very sharp decline  the question is the rate of growth going forward  and given the way businesses are managing and structuring their budgets going forward the way they are wringing productivityi think those are your words dave out of their workers i expect that final demand will be somewhat anemic  so its not a sharp v and going further out after you come through the check on the checkmark i expect a slower rate of growth 
chairman bernanke you dont go with a square root sign though  laughter 
mr fisher i have been informed its something that i fear  actually mr chairman i think this is a problem  our tail risks are almost undefinable  we could have that  we could also have the kind of explosive growth that dave was talking about earlier  and i would like to hear as you know more decision tree analysis as to how we would respond from a policy perspective under all three scenarios  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  the eighth district economy performed somewhat better than the us economy as a whole during the summer  according to our calculations 16 metropolitan statistical areas in the eighth district actually had slightly positive junejuly job growth as you know the us remained negative as a whole of course  some of this reflected auto production recalls but generally i took it as a positive sign for the eighth district economy  in fact job growth has been less negative in 2009 generally for the eighth district versus the nation 
however anecdotal information does not line up with the national forecast for growth in the second half of 2009 and here i would agree completely with president fisher  a general comment from directors and business contacts is  theres official talk about recovery but we dont see recovery in our businesses  and were not planning on recovery and were hunkering down i find that somewhat worrisome because it is ubiquitous and because were already at the end of the third quarter i would have expected to hear more positive anecdotes coming from the julyaugustseptember period it could be that these contacts are not seeing a return to previous levels its always a little hard to interpret when youre talking to businesspeople  they may only be seeing stabilization at a low level and theyre thinking back to the good old days when they had much higher levels  i did get just a few firms reporting that theyre more optimistic now and are seeing better business conditions to the point where they might consider additional cap ex one firm was in health care and another was in transportation 
on the national outlook i agree that the us economy is poised to return to growth after a year of declining gdp  i am anxious as many of you probably are to actually see positive growth as opposed to just market anticipation of that growth or macro forecasts of that growth  the current scenario does seem quite a bit stronger than some of the darker scenarios from earlier this year when we took aggressive policy actions  i hope that what were seeing is a durable bottoming out in housing and i do find it heartening that the recovery internationally has been stronger than expected i was one who was consistently worried that the global nature of this recession might present special problems for the fomc but i think that worry has subsided somewhat as the bounceback in europe and emerging asia and elsewhere has been very strong or stronger than expected 
i remain worried about inflation expectations over the medium term  of course we have lots of surveys and marketbased measures of these expectations  they seem to be well anchored however im worried that these may not be that informative  i think the typical market participants or survey respondents are effectively saying that the policy looks a little bit crazy but they kind of trust us to get the right inflation in the end  and so they say okay i will predict 2 percent even though i cant really see how you guys are going to do it  i think that is whats going on with a lot of the marketbased measures and the survey measures   
let me just follow up on this  it seems to me that people who hang around central banking and financial markets really dont know what to think about the unconventional policies that our committee is pursuing and im not sure really that we know ourselves what to make of these policies because we dont have models or a lot of experience with them  so the situation is that informed opinion is all over the mapyou do see that when you talk to people in financial markets  i think that creates a risky situation for the fomc  it may appear based on surveys that expectations are well anchored but its masking a real uncertainty thats out there  some people think there might be a lot of deflation and some people think there might be a lot of inflation and theyre not sure what to think 
in conjunction with this im concerned that current policies do not have a clear statecontingent aspect to them  the last 25 years of macroeconomics has argued that good optimal policy reacts to shocks reacts to the incoming information on the economy  the canonical taylor rule is one way to do that  but no matter what policy you want to pursue you would want to have the statecontingent character to it  how this reaction occurs needs to be communicated to markets  that informs the market pricing and the interest rates today so it does matter what people think your future policy is going to be and that means some kind of mapping to how you are going to react to future shocks  those expectations then complete the equilibrium and thats how the equilibrium is supported 
im concerned that were not doing that effectively right now  at this meeting were seeing that the outlook has improved substantially over what we thought earlier in the year  but were going to largely continue based on previous decisions without very much explicit reaction to the change in circumstances  that doesnt sound like the optimal statecontingent policy we need and were not communicating because i think we dont know how we might adjust in the future  so it strikes me that this is an area where current policy could be improved  if we could make adjustments in that direction i think the benefits would include a more effective program for us and better economic performance for the nation  thank you 
chairman bernanke thanks on state contingency i think i should just raise the possibility of corner solutions  if you have a constraint you could be up against that constraintit wouldnt be state contingent in that case  although we want to talk about future policy and so on but in terms of your actual instrument 
mr bullard do you mean that were at the zero bound 
chairman bernanke yes for example 
mr bullard definitely at the zero bound  weve got other policies though  we could tell markets how were going to adjust  lets suppose we get bad news in the january februarymarch period and the economy didnt turn out the way we had hoped  markets would like to know now if we got in that situation how wed react  and i just dont think were ready to tell them but wed like to be able to tell them as part of an optimal policy 
chairman bernanke president fisher 
mr fisher thats a more eloquent way of stating what i was referring to earlieror at least if not stating it understanding internally how we would respond under different circumstances 
chairman bernanke okay thank you president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  my forecast has not changed materially  i guess we were a little ahead of the greenbook  we are still looking for gdp growth to average about 3 percent over the next six quarters and then pick up to a pace more noticeably above potential in 2011 virtually all of my directors and business contacts reported continued improvement and modest firming of recent positive developments  clearly the evidence that the recovery is underway is getting stronger each month  but many contacts also offered another more guarded flavor of commentary probably along the lines of what president fisher said  now that the fear of a truly awful outcome has receded businesses are increasingly coming to grips with the realization that even though recovery is under way its likely to be a slow one with the unemployment rate remaining high for some time  the weak labor market will weigh on their customers confidence businesses planning and the strength and momentum of nearterm expansion  this guardedness is a natural reaction to events  by itself i dont think its an independent cause for concern but its something to be mindful of 
i will just touch quickly on some of the high points from my economic reports  inventory restocking is clearly under way and is boosting production  the implications for hiring are mixed  the business segments that were hardest hit cut employment most deeply and now we are bringing back some workers as they increase utilization  but most others who cut less deeply are not hiring yet  many business contacts stated that the recoverys momentum will be most uncertain in the first half of 2010 following the inventory restocking  reports of improvements in financial and credit conditions were widespread  several contacts involved in commercial real estate markets even reported substantial progress  all in all my discussions seemed consistent with an economy expected to grow for 18 months at a pace of about 3 percent  this tepid growth is from the bottom of a very deep recession and leaves the unemployment rate remaining above 9 percent during this phase of the recovery 
while there does not seem to be much disagreement over this outlook for the economy i continue to be surprised by the lack of agreement over the implications of the resulting measures of resource slack for inflation so lets see what i can add here  i think i understand the arguments implicit in last weeks communications from presidents plosser and lacker on the bluebook policy alternatives as well as some public commentary about resource slack  these arguments i think of roughly like this  first theory says inflation is a monetary phenomenon  i think we all agree with that second resource slack has tenuous and arguable implications for inflation and is measured with great uncertainty  and finally many economists reject resource slack implications because of these concerns 
but its an enormous leap to ignore entirely all measures of resource slack  output gaps are not unique in being unobservable and difficult to measure  inflation expectations are very important and are equally unobservable heterogeneous and the measures often are in conflict  just look at variations in liquidity in the tips markets for the compensation measures that we look at if you look carefully at the michigan survey and think about how the survey participants respond there are biases the data are censored and massaged quite a lotwe know we cant get the levels of inflation expectations right either  as i looked at inflation expectations data in part 2 of the greenbook the survey of professional forecasters had 22 percent for ten years ahead michigan had 29 the tips at the fiveyear fiveyear had 29  and these are all greater than our implicit target of 2 percent but when i look at the charts they have been there for quite some time  so getting the levels is really tough and looking at changes in inflation expectations is a bit of a dodge in the same way that we take the resource slack as given when we look at it 
now of course the signaltonoise ratios on our measures of resource slack are normally low that is noise is large  but currently all measures of slack are pointing in the same direction with large magnitudes the unemployment rate is just about 10 percent so the signaltonoise ratio is much better right now  just as importantly i think that without the idea of substantial resource slack its hard to understand what has been happening to inflation and inflation expectations hypothetically if the economys need for structural adjustments explains all or most of the drop in employment and output then why arent inflation expectations very high and rising  in that scenario the enormous growth in the monetary base would mean monetary policy is extraordinarily accommodative   
so something else must be keeping inflation expectations reasonably stable another unobservable factor is our credibility particularly high today our legion of critics doesnt believe that and if i believed that resource slack was minimal and then looked at our balance sheet i wouldnt think so either although im surprised that inflation expectations havent fallen more i strongly suspect the reason that they have stayed moderate in the face of massive monetary easing is that the public sees equally massive amounts of resource slack and expects that slack to eliminate most price pressures 
i share in calls for additional language and metrics to express the fomcs markers on inflation pressures  i think that those comments are right on target  such additional conditions would help guide us and communicate to the public our ability and resolve to keep inflation and inflation expectations well behaved  but currently i dont have any hesitation in including resource slack in this list of markers  it makes it tougher going back to my alma mater and talking to my advisors butlaughter 
thats it thank you 
chairman bernanke we all have to make sacrifices  laughter president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  im much more optimistic about the nascent recovery than i have been in a long while and i no longer see the risks around my modal forecast as asymmetrically skewed to the downside  over the last few months conditions in a wide variety of financial markets have improved and the economic news has been generally encouraging consumer spending appears to have bottomed out and the inventory cycle which is typically a key element in the transition dynamics from contraction to expansion is now providing considerable impetus to activity  even the housing and manufacturing sectors which were hardest hit during the recession are finally showing signs of life  to my surprise house prices now appear to be reestablishing an upward trend  like the greenbook we have revised up our expectation for their future paths 
the more positive outlook for home prices improves my confidence in the recovery for several reasons first the associated boost in housing wealth should have a favorable impact on consumer spending  second stabilization in house prices will help put a floor on the value of housingrelated securities which in turn should bring more clarity to the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions  and finally a positive trajectory in future home prices is an essential element in changing the economics and the psychology of the housing market  homeowners who were underwater or close to it are more likely to put off default and avoid foreclosure if they have some renewed prospect for houseprice appreciation  and potential buyers who have been holding off waiting for the bottom in house prices may finally be coaxed into the market  in effect the feedback loop from financial conditions to the real economy may finally be switching directions supporting growth and even creating some upside risk 
that said there are also downside risks  in addition to all of the risks surrounding commercial real estate im concerned that some and possibly a lot of the improvement weve seen in the housing sector may result from policy supports that are about to unwind in particular the firsttime homebuyer tax credit which is set to expire at the end of november likely boosted activity although perhaps at the cost of pulling demand from future quarters  and our mbs purchase program does appear to have lowered mortgage rates significantly  i was struck by the survey evidence from the desk of 60 basis points  our own estimates are a full percentage point  theres obviously a lot of uncertainty about what will happen when the program ends but i certainly found it sobering to see that the dealers surveyed by the desk anticipate that the impact of this program on mortgage rates will be fully reversed within six months 
even though i now believe that a recovery has taken hold and is likely to be sustained into 2010 my perspective on policy is importantly influenced by my expectation that it will be tepid by historical standards leaving unemployment unacceptably high for a long time to come  consistent with experiences around the world following recessions caused by financial crises i anticipate that it will take quite a while for the financial system to heal to the point that something like normal credit flows can be restored  in addition even if the saving rate stabilizes and consumer spending again grows we are not apt given damaged household balance sheets and weak labor markets to see the exuberant spending growth that characterized the years preceding the crisis  moreover i see a substantial chance that the saving rate will head higher than in the greenbook baseline finally i foresee a jobless recovery with weak employment growth and persistently high unemployment  my business contacts uniformly report that they have implemented productivity improvements in the downturn that will permit them to hold down hiring until the recovery is very well entrenched 
turning to inflation it will surprise no one around the table that i anticipate that the prospect of high unemployment for years to come is a key factor shaping the outlook  we must of course be attentive to the possibility that the nairu has changed and as ive noted in past meetings i do think there is some evidence that the nairu has increased  this round the greenbook edged up the staffs nairu estimate to 5 percent on a temporary basis in light of the large number of permanent layoffs taking place and a possible shift in the beveridge curve  i could quibble with these adjustments but any fraction of a percentage point increase in the level of the nairu pales in size relative to the 5 percentage point jump in the unemployment rate over the past two years under any reasonable interpretation of the evidence both labor and product markets have a considerable amount of slack  and the existence of a causal link between slack and resource utilization and wage and price inflation is not only theoretically sensible its also consistent with both anecdotal and econometric evidence 
to collect some anecdotal evidence we asked all of our head office and branch directors during the intermeeting period to provide us with their assessments of the extent of slack in their industry or geographic area and to tell us what if any effect such slack and other factors are having and will have on their costs and output prices going forward  not surprisingly our directors uniformly report that qualified job applicants are plentiful that voluntary quits have plummeted and that workers are thankful to have jobs and are readily accepting lower wage increases and even wage cuts on the price side the directors report pervasive pricediscounting  almost uniformly they are badgering every supplier and vendor for price reductions and these negotiations are generally successful with average price discounts on the order of 10 to 15 percent 
with respect to econometric evidence my staff has kept our computers running overtime estimating phillips curves  they find that so far in this recession outofsample forecasts from a simple backwardlooking phillips curve have been right on track in predicting the decline we have seen in core pce inflation over the past year  this model notably outperforms a random walk or other empirical specifications that include inflation expectations andor lagged inflation but exclude slack it is not that the phillips curve is perfectfar from itand at best a slack variable can account for only about 30 percent of the fluctuations in core inflation  but as jim stock mark watson and other researchers have shown it is the best empirical inflation forecasting framework that we have 
with respect to my inflation forecast the basic empirical phillips curve model predicts substantial further disinflation in contrast the greenbook projects very modest disinflation in core prices under the assumption that inflation expectations will play an important role in anchoring inflation around 2 percent  i too hope that inflation will not move much lower  but theres a lot we dont know about how inflation expectations affect actual inflation and about how to measure the expectations that are relevant for price setting  for example our estimated finance models indicate that many of the recent fluctuations in the breakeven inflation rate reflect movements in the inflation risk premiums and that inflation expectations have actually drifted down over the past year we should therefore remain attentive to downside inflationary risks 
i understand that at our december meeting we will have an indepth discussion of inflation modeling and forecasting and i look forward to that  at our last meeting president stern aptly described the use of a phillips curve to forecast inflation  he said it takes a model to beat a model and i dont think we have another model in the short run  and i agree 
chairman bernanke thank you i should just say that for the december meeting the current plan is to have a presentationby reserve banks i guesson inflation dynamics  so well try to bring back the continuing education aspect of this meeting 
were well into the 600 hour thank you everyone  why dont we adjourn until 900 am tomorrow morning  theres a reception and a dinner but no businessits an optional dinner for your convenience so ill see you at 900  thank you 
meeting recessed 

september 23 2009morning session 
chairman bernanke good morning everybody  i recognize the vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you  i was remiss yesterday in not introducing angela oconnor sitting next to brian sack from the markets group  so i apologize angela 
ms oconnor thank you 
vice chairman dudley  welcome 
chairman bernanke welcome  good we can continue with the economic goround and i have president hoenig to lead off 
mr hoenig good morning thank you the tenth district like the rest of the nation appears to be climbing its way out of the recession  weve seen some slight improvement in retail sales our manufacturing index is up above 50 and theres clearly some improvement in our inventory situation notably in housing which has stabilizedin fact were actually seeing some improvement  where we continue to struggle is obviously with commercial real estate which is a big issue for us  our agricultural sector this year will be down because prices are down primarily for bumper crops  also our labor markets are stable theyre not improving they may show some uptick but very little we suspect as the economy and the region has settled out even our energy sector which has been in the doldrumsas president fisher said because we produce a lot of natural gashas at least stabilized for now  so were working our way out and i would say in a manner similar to that for the nation as a whole 
when we consider the nation and the outlook i think that we are in recovery  there are signs in our region and elsewhere of selfcorrecting mechanismsthe runoff in inventories the rebuilding manufacturing picking up  some of that is selfsustaining hopefully and will move us forward 
as weve started this recovery and as we look forward there continues to be enormous stimulus that is yet to play out both fiscal stimulus that is under way and will go through 2010 and monetary stimulus as well  and i think thats very important to keep in mind as we look ahead as we anticipate inflation and issues like that i think its also important to remember that we do need to look many quarters ahead because everything thats happening today reflects steps we were involved in several quarters ago or at least in the spring  in that regard i think we face a challenge looking at the immediate recovery sustaining that recovery and then looking far enough ahead that we dont introduce new problems for ourselves  and thats what i do worry about regarding inflation and other asset issues that might come up 
were going to be in a position of trying as you say to bring our monetary policy to a more neutral level in those quarters  its going to take a long time to do that  and well be using instruments weve never used beforethat means theres going to be slippage and that means there are going to be mistakes  anticipating the next discussion a little bit as we think about first quarter when i think there is a good chance the recovery will be sustained i cannot help but wonder if one of our most important toolsand there is risk with every choice we makeis to do nothing in terms of buying assets that we would then almost immediately have to sterilize 
on the matter of excess capacity of course we are just starting the recovery so there is excess capacity for example a while ago if you took a railroad in my part of the world and you asked the ceo about capacity hed have told you that he had cars parked that would just about cross the state of kansasand for those of you who dont know kansas thats a long way  laughter more recently though his parked cars stretch only as far as great bend kansas and for those of you who dont know kansas thats still a long way but less so  so the capacity is being worked off and thats the process thats under way  so we have to be thinking about when the capacity will be used up compared with when our monetary policy will be in a more neutral position those are the hard choices i think we have and thats why i am worried about our timing in terms of purchasing assets and continuing on that path  so thank you very much mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  my business contacts in the fourth district continue to be wary about developments in the economy  while most businesses reported incremental gains in their output levels earlier this summer many have already seen a tapering off of those gains other contacts reported that orders are fluctuating with no discernible trend overall i would characterize the predominant mood of the business executives i speak with as uncertain and cautious 
one of the reasons there is so much uncertainty is that the improvements that we have seen in the critical industries appear to be tied to shortterm stimulus programs  district auto sales got a clear boost from the cashforclunkers program and auto production plans have now been increased for both the third and fourth quarters  there is also no question that there have been ripple effects through the supply chain all the way back to orders for steel  this increased production in autos and industries related to autos was critical to the stabilization in the fourth district output that we reported in the latest beige book 
but the limited gains in the industrial sector to date do lead me to think that this recovery is very fragile underscoring the fragility is the uncertainty about just how sustainable the demand for car sales will be into and beyond the fourth quarter  for similar reasons my contacts in the real estate industry are concerned that sales may decline once the firsttime homebuyer tax credit expires on december 1 they certainly arent complaining about the support which is drawing in new homebuyers yet they also report that an unusual number of sellers are renting rather than purchasing moveup houses  one real estate executive said that traditionally four out of five sales are to moveup buyers whereas he is only seeing two out of five sales to moveup buyers in the current market  the lack of moveup purchasing has limited the impact of the firsttime homebuyer programs and moveup purchasing is going to be critical once the firsttime homebuyer incentives are exhausted  again the economys fragility is partly hidden by incentives which in this case are scheduled to roll off later this year 
concerns such as these weighed on my outlook for economic growth particularly in the fourth quarter i anticipate a gradual and bumpy recovery  my outlook does not have sustained abovetrend growth until the second half of 2010 with the unemployment rate topping off at just over 10 percent early next year 
turning to inflation two pieces of research done by my staff helped to guide my outlook  the first is a model of inflation expectations that does not rely on tips to estimate inflation expectations instead the model combines inflation data nominal bond rates survey measures of inflation expectations and inflation swaps to construct estimates of expected inflation  this model shows that inflation expectations remain stable from two to ten years out  second my staff along with the staff at the atlanta fed has been examining the detailed price data by splitting the consumer price index market basket according to whether prices of goods and services are sticky or flexible  the stickier prices appear to be a particularly informative measure of core inflation in that they more reliably predict future inflation  our staff analysis shows that the inflation rate of the goods and services with stickier prices has shifted sharply lower this year this trend points to suppressed inflation rates for the next few quarters 
these results point to some crosscurrents i see in putting together an inflation projection  in the near term resource slack is likely to depress core inflation numbers while over the medium term monetary and fiscal policies and stable inflation expectations should support an inflation trajectory toward 2 percent  specifically i expect core pce inflation to dip below 1 percent in 2010 but to increase gradually toward 2 percent in 2011 
overall the risks to my inflation outlook remain balanced  regarding the risks to my outlook for economic growth though i think i appear to be in the small minority because i still see the risks to growth to the downside i am concerned that the gains that we have seen recently in the real economy are limited and are potentially just temporary reflections of the policy actions undertaken earlier this year  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  first vice president lyon 
mr lyon thank you mr chairman  let me first address the district outlook  consistent with the incoming national data the ninth district economy is showing some signs of improvement  for instance survey data indicate that manufacturing activity in the dakotas has increased and has remained steady in minnesota  we are seeing a modest but nevertheless perceptible increase in anecdotal reports of businesses plans to expand production  activity in the energy and mining sectors of the district economy is also showing a slight increase  exploration activity is up somewhat and there are scattered reports of plans to restart idle production and expand facilities for example a large iron ore mine in northern minnesota has resumed production  the healthcare sector appears to have weathered the recession relatively well residential construction activity appears to have stabilized albeit at low levels  while the results vary across the district we are now seeing some improvement in the level of home sales in various metropolitan areas commercial real estate in contrast continues to be weak  commercial real estate markets have been depressed by a combination of lower economic activity rising vacancy rates tighter credit conditions and rapidly falling property values  on the flip side lower rental rates should help the profitability of businesses that need space 
despite the recent improvement in the national data district consumer spending has been soft with the exception of auto sales which have been buoyed by the cashforclunkers program  anecdotal reports on samestore retail sales indicate declines of 4 to 8 percent compared with a year ago  across the district our contacts report that while the number of tourists has increased the level of tourismrelated spending remains somewhat soft relative to prior norms  in agriculture crop development is about two weeks behind normal due to late planting and a cool summer  an early frost could significantly reduce production which would negatively affect food processors ethanol plants and ranchers  unemployment levels across the district from minnesota to montana remain low compared with the national average with the most recent readings from 43 percent in north dakota to 8 percent in minnesota 
turning to the national economy most of the incoming data remain consistent with our forecast of a nearterm increase in output and subdued inflation  a reduction in the rate of business inventory liquidation firming of consumer spending and some growth in federal spending should support the resumption of economic growth during the remainder of the year  developments since the last meeting have served to reinforce this view  the august uptick in retail sales data on orders and shipments of capital goods business sentiment and the rise in sales and starts of singlefamily homes are all consistent with improvement in the level of economic activity  the gradual reduction of the adverse impacts of declines in wealth should also support a rise in consumer spending 
as president stern noted in august our forecast in recent months has been for a bit more rapid growth than in the prior greenbook given the markup in the greenbook forecast since the last meeting our forecast and that of the greenbook are now more closely aligned  while the outlook has improved since the last meeting in my view the principal risks to our forecast are to the downside going forward the expiration of some of the government programs that have been providing support to the economy creates uncertainty in the outlook moreover beyond the third quarter the ongoing weakness in labor markets particularly the very low rate of gross hiring by private firms raises questions about where household earnings growth will come from and where workers who are no longer building houses strip malls and suvs will be reemployed  prolonged uncertainty about job prospects and tight consumer credit markets could lead consumers to reverse course and cut spending this year or next and this in turn could feed another round of production and inventory cuts  while i believe that these risks can be avoided i will feel significantly more confident in this view with a few more months of positive developments 
consistent with the greenbook forecast i expect improvements in employment will be gradual and i believe that this is the inevitable byproduct of a necessary process of resource reallocation  as such i believe that at least to some extent we must be prepared simply to allow this process to unfold recognizing that it may not be particularly responsive to incremental additional stimulus  despite the improved outlook for economic activity i expect inflation expectations to remain well anchored and agree with the greenbook forecast that inflation will remain within acceptable bounds  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  the economy is clearly doing better  all indications are that we will have a pretty strong bounce in activity during the second half of the year3 percent annualized real gdp growth seems likely and the risks over the near term are probably to the upside i think of the greenbook forecast because inventory cycles can be very powerful 
that said i still think it is very premature to declare victory for several reasons  first a good portion of the growth will come from the swing in the pace of inventory accumulation rather than strength in final demand  second the banking system is still impaired  bank credit outstanding has been declining small businesses and commercial real estate sectors are particularly starved for credit and that is likely to continue for some time  third payrolls are still falling and the unemployment rate is still rising  fourth we dont know how households will respond to the sharp drop in net worth at a time that household debt burdens remain high  i can imagine a combination of higher household saving and increased labor market participation as baby boomers postpone retirement  the first would damp demand the second would raise the amount of slack in the labor market  fifth we are already in the process of removing accommodationthe purchase programs are going to move to the slower pace the liquidity programs are being gradually unwound and other government support to the financial sector such as the money market fund guarantees and the tlgp are being withdrawn 
at a time when the unemployment rate is very high and is still rising and when there is ample slack in the economy i think we want to be cautious in moving too quickly to take back additional accommodation what we want is a robust recovery that pushes the unemployment rate down quicklythats what we are going for that doesnt seem to be in the cards  nothing that ive heard around the table suggests that thats the expectation of the members of the committee 
until we actually see that robust recovery i think were getting well ahead of ourselves in talking about removing additional accommodation  although some are worried about the longerterm inflation outlook over the next year or two to me the risks seem very much on the downside core services inflation has come down a lot core goods inflation seems likely to follow given the large amount of excess capacity available in the us and abroad were already below a rate of core inflation consistent with our longerterm forecast for the core pce deflator and core inflation typically falls during the early stages of recovery  in fact if the recovery were to turn out to be more robust than expected i would expect that would lead to a further surprise on the productivity front and potentially even more downward pressure on inflation over the next year or two thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  as many have remarked there has been more good news over the intermeeting period and i have been especially encouraged by the nascent recovery in private final demandthis is more than just an inventory cycle  importantly better economic data are feeding and feeding off of continued improvement in financial markets at least in many sectors of the those markets so weve got a bit of a virtuous cycle in play and thats a nice change from where we were a few months ago 
the repeated pleasant surprises on the economy and upward revisions to the forecast led me to question whether i had been missing some part of the recovery process and should mark the forecast up further than the staff even though the staff itself is now a little bit beyond private forecasters i looked at a couple of candidates  one was the issue of pentup demand for houses consumer durables and business capital given the very very low levels of spending on these categories and in the case of houses declines in prices which ought to boost demand  as the vshaped recovery scenario in the greenbook notes investment is low even relative to replacement demand much less relative to some tendency for the capital stock to grow over time  so pentup demand is quite a possibility and would be characteristic of other recoveries i think 
nonetheless there are reasons to doubt a strong rebound in the current circumstances  first the recession started with a very marked oversupply of houses and probably of consumer durables given the overly generous supply of credit to households  its true that the housing vacancy rate has come down a little biti think the last data we have are for the second quarterbut its still very high for businesses record low capacity utilization high vacancy rates in many commercial structures and as most of you have noted in your comments a very cautious outlook for sales will hold back investment in that sector  so i think stronger household and business investment spending is an upside risk but its not part of my central tendency 
the second candidate for a process i might be missing was more traction than anticipated for monetary stimulus now that the financial panic has abated  that is low levels of nominal and real interest rates along with massive amounts of reserves could be inducing a diversification into riskier assets including foreign assets which would lower the foreign exchange value of the dollar and thereby raise bond and equity prices this is exactly what we intended by our easy monetary policy but it could be happening faster than we expected  and i think elements in this story are certainly evident over the intermeeting period  like presidents plosser and lacker i was struck by the combination of higher equity prices and lower spreads with lower treasury yields at the same time  i think market participants gained confidence in the sustainability of the recovery but they also gained confidence in the persistence of low inflation given the incoming price data and the stillweak labor markets which will keep demand from rising very rapidly  greater confidence in the outlook reduced uncertainty in risk premiums and low inflation risks enabled market participants to push off the expected date of policy tightening  notably this phenomenon was widespread internationally and not particular to the united states  so i see this as more of a current and expected interest rate channel responding to macroeconomic data rather than reflecting some putting to use of the large volume of reserves weve put into the system  i expect continued improvement of this sort in part reflecting markets that will continue to postpone expected tightening as inflation stays low but i expect this improvement to be gradual 
an important limiting factor in this is the banking system  the gains have largely been in securities markets bank credit to households and small businesses remains very tight and if anything tightened further over the third quarter as we can see in the spreads on business loan rates over base rates in the survey of terms of business lending and the problems perceived by small businesses in the nfib survey  credit card spreads and terms have been tightening  banks are looking at rising losses on consumer and cre credit those banks below the top few dont have the offset of higher profits from capital markets business  the process of rebuilding bank capital and willingness to take risks is going to be gradual and prolonged and with securitization markets only partly recovered our economy is likely to be more bankdependent 
president plosser asked what should we be looking at to gauge whether reserves are being put to use  id be looking at both the price or interest rate and quantity of bank lending as important things  weve already noted i think that prices stayed high that is the rates have stayed high so there is no evidence there and the quantities also are very very weakif anything the pace of the decline in bank credit has picked up  i think if it were just a shift in demand id expect interest rates to come down while quantities were falling  so i do think were looking at very very tight if not tightening supplies  to the extent that quantitative easing works through the money supply in the hands of the public that too has been weak  so i think greater traction for policy is an upside risk but its also not in my central tendency  my most likely outlook for activity is something like the staff forecaststrengthening growth as bank credit and lending capacity rebuild and as markets and households rebuild balance sheets a very gradual rise in resource utilization with the unemployment rate remaining high for some time 
i think there are downside as well as upside risks to this forecast  weve all cited household saving as one possibilitythat is households may decide to rebuild net worth faster in light of increased uncertainty about jobs their financial position and their reduced access to credit theres also a downside risk as a couple of people have noted this morning if it turns out that the improvement to the economy and financial markets has been more dependent on government support both fiscal and financial than we had been thinking  as fiscal stimulus wears off over the next year and financial help and backstops are reduced by the federal reserve and other government agencies i think theres a risknot a big one but a riskthat growth could slow down or at least fail to gather momentum 
so i think that something like the staff forecast or even a little stronger is likely to be accompanied by stable to falling inflation core inflation continues to edge lowerby less than we expected some months ago but its still edging lower  labor compensation is decelerating sharply to unusually low levels by many measures  some of this is adjustments in bonuses and the bonuses are likely to rise again  but i think that looking through all of these measures the underlying trend in compensation is clearly downward and i take this as indicating that there is considerable excess supply in the labor market  combined with rapid productivity growth unit labor costs are falling very very fast there are no labor cost pressures on businesses and markups over unit labor costs have risen sharply 
id like to associate myself with the comments of presidents evans and yellen yesterday on the question of slack and inflation measures of slack cannot be estimated with a great deal of confidence nor can the relationship between slack and inflation  but the unemployment rate has risen so high so fast and capacity utilization has dropped so low so fast that there must be considerable labor and capital resources looking to and able to be put back to work  in this kind of environment competitive pressures on employees and employers will remain intense  i dont expect any sign of pricing power to emerge any time soon  i agree that rising inflation expectations could overcome the effects of slack but to date measures from surveys of households and economists from financial markets seem quite stable once you get beyond shortterm energy and liquidityinduced fluctuations 
president plosser raised the question of the level of the household survey  household surveys historically tend to run high i think higher than economists and higher than reality  i know this has been a source of continuing frustration for the ecb where they cant ever cite the household surveys as validating their inflation target so they always cite the consensus forecasts of economists 
in sum i look for somewhat stronger growth but a stillslow increase in resource utilization and damped and probably declining inflation  well get to the policy implications in the next round thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  for the first time in a long while i have more conviction about what is going to happen in the next two or three quarters than i do over the next two or three years for the past couple of years and especially last year we wondered what was at our doorstep now we can look to the mediumterm forecast and say well this stuff will all work out i would say in some ways this is as it should be  nearterm prospects and projections should be clearer to policymakers and i think for the first time at least for me they are 
in terms of the trajectory of the economy though i would say i also feel better about the next few quarters than i do the next few years  the reason for that improvement in conviction and in its strength on the real side of the economy has a lot to do with the asset price improvements and has considerably to do in addition as dave stockton said yesterday with inventories as well as with the mix of fiscal and monetary measures which are certainly helping the arithmetic of nearterm gdp  i think the greenbook is right in suggestingand not being as dismissive as many of us myself included would have been six or nine months agothe chance of a positive feedback loop that takes us out of where we are with greater strength and conviction economies have been underestimated in the postwar era and maybe were underestimating the resiliency of this one  
how durable is this improvement beyond the near term  weve all heard stories  i heard many of them from you yesterday about fortune 500 ceos  if i go back to the 20012002 recession and recovery these ceos were lousy indicators about the turns in the economy  so i guess im not that troubled that they continue to have their heads in their hands  i think the difference this time and the reason why this time they could be right is that youve got to look long and hard to find real anecdotes of small businesses that are seeing opportunities  given what don talked about in terms of the bank lending and the ability of small businesses to access credit to access capital and to get their own animal spirits back it may be that businesses large and small are still suffering from a bit of pessimism while we need them to be much more on their front foot 
another question about the durability of the improvement and whether it will find mediumterm forecasts as good as the greenbook suggests is the state of private final demand in 2010 its hard to know whether the handoffs from the public sector stimulus to the private sector improvements will happen as smoothly and in as linear a fashion as the greenbook suggests also its hard to know whether recent improvements in industrial production are sustainable   
and on the consumer income issue that many people have talked about the question is  will incomes be sufficient to fund consumption amid this specter of large unemployment  personally im more worried about low income excluding transfer payments than i am low consumption per se  and if the unemployment levels stay as high as they are will there be enough impetus in incomes particularly if our asset prices smooth out over time to fund the kind of consumption levels that are consistent with a reasonably positive greenbooktype forecast 
my mediumterm forecast as a result of all of that is improved somewhat but its not marked up as much as the greenbook  i think the risks are predominantly but not exclusively to the downside the risk is that potential economic growth and employment may have faltered making this recession in some sense more costly than the recent loss of jobs and output alone  i think the continuing questions of the fiscal sustainability and markets acceptance of continuing treasury issuance are real risk factors to the mediumterm forecasts 
let me turn then to financial markets before talking about inflation  on the financial market front id describe my own views at least in terms of nearterm financial market prices and market functioning as tactically long but strategically short  what do i mean by that theres still a ton of momentum in these markets  as i said when we met last about six weeks ago though i was a skeptic about the degree of improvements in the spring and the summer this thing has so much going for it in terms of momentum in terms of money coming off the sidelines in terms of institutional and retail investors who dont want to miss the next leg that it strikes me as imprudent at least in the very near term to try to stand in front of this wave and not get blown over zero rates seem to be having some hand in driving this reflation in asset prices 
but why am i strategically short or at least strategically nervous i worry about the sustainability of these improvements in markets given the questions weve all talked about on the real side of the economy  many are saying well this time i will get out just in time and that reminds us of what we heard not too long ago  still on net consumer net worth has rallied with asset prices and it is probably up another couple trillion dollars when we see the ultimate data from the third quarter with the corresponding wealth and confidence effects 
what are market price signals telling us  market prices might be as unclear as theyve been in a very long time even though on the real economy side we feel better  its tougher to judge what these markets are telling us because of a few changes  one seeming changes in investor preferences and asset allocation two changes in the financial architecture which i have talked about before and three our extraordinary participation as the government in these markets  how much of the difficulty in handling these market signals is driven by our participation explicitly and implicitly is hard to tell  i think the chairman mentioned yesterday this odd constellation of market signals since we last met as a committeestock prices are up bond yields are down treasury yields are down the foreign exchange value of the dollar is down commodity prices are up that is hard for me to reconcile i could tell a long and twisted story but its not a terribly convincing one and it would certainly be nothing more than a rationalization 
but let me start on the simplest pieces of it and those are stocks and bonds  why are they both performing as smartly  i would say markets might be at a transitional pointsome kind of barbelland thinking about asset allocation  theyve seen equity markets move against them theyre looking for alpha theyre looking for returns and so theyre going out and buying equities but just in case theyre wrong they want to make sure that they hold on to enough cashwhich is near and dear to their heartsso that if the world were to somehow end again they would have that intermediate risks and intermediate credits seem to me to be looked upon somewhat more negatively by marginal investors 
my last point on financial markets is on treasury and treasury market signals and what theyre telling us they do seem to be incredibly supportive of massive issuance  it reminds me in some ways of risk measures where risk is highest when measures of risk are actually lowest  the treasury markets seem to be telling us that the supply will have infinite demand but that should make us nervous  it does strike me that the treasury market wont get slowly but surely uncomfortable with these debttogdp ratios but rather that it might come in a hurry  if it does i think the consequences both for the real economy and the challenges we face in monetary policy will become quite remarkable 
now when might that moment come  i dont know  but i would say that the debtlimit issue that the congress and the administration will be debating most likely over the course of november might well be that catalyst  this debtlimit discussion has had a partisan nature to it going back about 20 to 25 years but i wonder whether or not there is just enough in the air about fiscal sustainability that we should pay particular attention to what the treasury markets are telling us in the forthcoming period 
finally on inflation i have to agree with the emerging consensus among many folks in this room about the pressure on wages given various measures of slack  going against that theme though it does strike me that if the dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies and for whatever reason whether because of global final demand or something else commodities continue to strengthen these crosscurrents will be hitting each other  how they net out for measures of inflation and inflation expectations strikes me as a paramount challenge for policymaking  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you governor duke 
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  before i start id like to go back to the question i missed yesterday which was on the accounting  i did find out that we actually take exception to gaap with the evaluation of the soma portfolio on the rationale that our purchases and sales are driven by monetary policy considerations rather than valuation  as we go forward with the mbs purchases this rationale could get pretty stressed especially if we choose the securities that we sell for their valuation rather than for some monetary policy reason  i point that out just so that were aware that the accounting issues we face may ultimately have some political costs at least when we start to exit so we cant entirely ignore the losses in those securities 
turning to observations from the banking sector most of the banks report little change in their current or expected condition since the last meeting  in terms of new lending theres very low demand across the board but pricing is still significantly better  i asked why is it with very low demand that your pricing is still so strong  they said theyre only lending to the highestquality credits with relationships with profitability and borrowers are actually happy to have the lending relationships intact  theres very little shopping and very little competition banks arent chasing someone elses customers and customers arent looking for a new bank  line usage is at historic lows even by the borrowers who already have approved credit at very favorable pricing and borrowers whose banks have closed or been acquired are actually orphaned and unable to get the best terms 
ive been trying to understand the difference between the credit availability in this cycle and the one that followed the last banking crisis the staff used the flow of funds data to try to estimate the difference between forecast and actual levels of credit and found that at this point in the cycle about 46 percent of the difference can be explained by credit factors rather than economic factors compared to 62 percent in the 199091 cycle 
in terms of loan quality interestingly one member of the fac noted that when they met here a week or two ago they had dinner with the chairman and not one of the bankers had an outlook as positive as the chairman expressed  they were quite amazed at the chairmans cheerfulness laughter most see the next six quarters as stable at best  in terms of consumer credit chargeoffs they think theyre at or close to the worst at least in dollar terms if not in percentages on credit card and auto loans but they dont see any dramatic improvement from there rather just a gradual pull back from current levels that are at historic highs 
the same holds true for earlystage delinquencies on residential mortgages which are now displaying their historic correlations with new claims rather than with overall unemployment but the picture is a lot murkier for laterstage delinquencies  frankly the systems were never designed to track modifications foreclosure moratoriums partial paymentsall of the things that are going on in the already delinquent loans  so nobody seems quite sure but most expect that the picture will be clearer by mid to late 2010 and no sooner as the bankers and servicers improve their processes for modifications and short sales while foreclosure and real estate liquidation backlogs clear 
commercial real estate is still the big wild card and at this point the losses on residential construction and land development loans are beginning at least to track the carrying values and the book value of the remaining assets is very low  there was interestingly some reported interest from the large national builders in finished lots in selected geographies particularly southern california and texas and even a little bit in las vegas and stated interest in land for development in 2011 but all at very low prices  the weakest areas for construction loans are florida arizona and nevada with florida reported as having the longest probable time for recovery incomeproducing properties are showing signs of stress with rising vacancies and rent renegotiations but most still view this stress as primarily driven by economic fundamentals rather than widespread overbuilding  hospitality is faring the worst followed by retail and then industrial office properties are holding up remarkably well as are multifamily residences 
losses on owneroccupied properties are tracking at fractions of the loss levels that were assumed in the stress test and every single banker asserts that credit decisions for new and troubled credit are being driven over concern on regulatory classifications regulatory classifications to capital and examiner pressure  bankers are reluctant to take any action thats going to require them to raise additional capital which is available to them in varying degrees but uniformly expensive 
in terms of forecasting i have difficulty determining the degree to which the level of credit restraint thats baked into the greenbook forecast matches the current banker mindset  but i have a hard time constructing a scenario where consumer spending returns with any vigor given the weak appetite for risk and the high level of credit impairment 
bankers are talking about their desire to lend only to prime borrowers but the population of subprime borrowers continues to grow  households with credit scores considered to be subprime has increased from 28 percent of the population at the peak in 2006 to nearly 36 percent  in terms of absolute numbers the number of subprime borrowers grew from 63 million to 80 million at the end of 2008 and this is before factoring in changes in income wealth or collateral values which dont necessarily track where the population of subprime is found  banks report total unused commitments are down 1 trillion from the peak with 1 trillion of that in credit card availability  new credit card solicitations are down from a peak of 800000 per month to 150000 per month with subprime down 85 percent   
the same credit impairment factors are also likely to influence the housing rebound  given the expectation that high losses in the construction portfolio are going to continue into next year as will the intense regulatory scrutiny banks willingness to lend for residential construction is especially low most of the sales in new construction are reportedly in lowend products and banks forecast that they wont work through their backlog until mid2010 
weve talked about improvement in financial markets but nothing has been done to reconstruct the housing finance system or residential mortgage securitization outside of extraordinary government support  as yet there is not even the beginning of a consensus around the requirements for new private securitizations while accounting changes seem to be creating new barriers the firsttime homebuyer credit is set to expire and support for renewing it so far appears tepid the administration has announced that it will not have a proposal about the future of the gses until early next year and it is apparently approaching this as a full discussion of the proper role of government in housing finance  the fha is reportedly coming close to its minimum reserve level  its loan volume has spiked as private subprime retreated  so it wouldnt be unreasonable to expect higher losses with that increase in volume  finally our purchase of agency mbs is likely going to come to an end at least by the end of the first quarter 
with all of these headwinds coming into play i can envision a good case for actually extending our purchases and even expanding the size to get into the second quarter as all of these supports are removed from the housing market  at the same time im concerned that neither we nor the banks know yet how big an impact the addition of another 600 to 800 billion in reserves is likely to have the big runup in reserves actually occurred last fall when banks were scrambling for liquidity and they really viewed it as their own decision to take on additional liquidity not our decision to put the liquidity there  since then the aggregate reserves have fluctuated in a fairly narrow band as new asset purchases were offset with reduced borrowing so discussions with smaller banks paint a picture similar to what was found by staff in consultation with the larger institutionsthey havent focused on the reserves but they report that they have more deposits than they can profitably invest and therefore are reducing their managed liabilities  rates paid on deposits are being reduced and deposit competition appears benign i would also point out that at 25 basis points reserves are the most attractive shortterm riskfree asset for banks to hold 
with the treasurys planned sfp drawdown settlements of prior purchases as well as new purchases banks are going to see substantial and unexpected increases in their reserve balances very soon and most bankers are not focused on the aggregate reserves in the system  to bankers this is just going to look like excess liquidity and the only way to deal with excess liquidity is either to buy riskier assets or reduce liabilities  given the credit situation i expect the bankers to shed liabilities likely leading to shrinkage similar to that described by president rosengren in the japanese banks thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  back in my accustomed spot at the end of the queue i thought the one criterion for deciding what to say might be to offer only my insights that will add value to what has already been said  mr chairman that concludes my statement  laughter 
understanding however that another purpose of the goround might be to explain each members views to the committee as a whole let me note a few points that most inform my outlook first the employment situation continues to be dismal  scan the monthly bls release and the only demographic group whose unemployment rate looks less than disheartening is that for college graduates at 47 percent a look behind even that figure gives little reason for comfort insofar as it stood at 27 percent just a year ago  most of the rest of the numbers are downright discouraging of greater relevance perhaps for present purposes is the near unanimity of forecasters that improvement in the labor market will be painfully slow  the most optimistic alternative greenbook scenario has the unemployment rate barely breaking 7 percent at the end of 2011 a review of the latest blue chip economic indicators reveals that all but one of the 50 forecasters believe the average unemployment rate in 2010 will come in above 9 percent to say that we are nowhere near achieving the maximum employment component of our dual mandate would be a major understatement  the most that can fairly be said is that the bottoming of negative employment trends may at some point soon be coming into view 
second in looking back at my statement at the last meeting i would have to amend my view that gdp growth in the second half of 2009 will perhaps be quite positive to an expectation that it will almost surely be quite positive with a good chance of being modestly above trend  but i see little to change my view of six weeks ago that 2010 is most likely to witness what i termed the grind it out scenario with economic growth ultimately above trend but nowhere near the slope of recovery one might expect out of a deep recession   
indeed there remains good reason to believe that one or more factors will keep the economic road sufficiently rocky that we will have difficulty sustaining a good head of steam  continuing high unemployment will impose a constraint on pce growth  a higher personal saving rate than the 4 percent expected by the greenbook to remain unchanged for the next two years would similarly drag down pce growth  the fading of the stimulus package by the middle of 2010 creates further uncertainty as to just how robust consumer demand will be and thus how much production will grow once inventory drawdowns are completed  the prospect of ongoing high levels of home foreclosures suggests that downward pressure on the housing market may not fully abate for some time  finally the ongoing steep decline in bank lending like the continuing dysfunction in some other parts of credit markets appears to reflect something more than just the tightened lending standards associated with recessions 
in the interest of completeness i should note that prospects for a stronger global recovery have brightened considerably one of the factors i suggested that might support my rejuvenation scenario here at home  asia in particular seems to have generated enough momentum to outlast the withdrawal of extraordinary stimulus still i would note that in china and most other east asian countries we havent yet seen the emergence of a real promise of selfsustaining final consumer demand 
if some of the preceding sounds familiar it should  i lifted a good bit of it from my comments at the august fomc the intervening month and a half has reinforced the positive signs for the remainder of this year and i would say slightly rebalanced in a more optimistic direction the respective probabilities of relapse grind it out or rejuvenation  but all three remain plausible outcomes  in sum i find myself singing much the same tune as last time but even as i reprise my coda i want to alter it a bit adding some lyrics suggested by president bullards remarks yesterday afternoon  and here im going to take advantage of my holding down the sixteenth spot in the batting order to slide a little bit into relevant policy considerations  i stand by my august recommendation of patience during this period where the probabilities of each of my three scenarios remain significant  the additional thought picking up on president bullards comment is that we should be prepared to undertake an appropriate policy response no matter which of the three emerges as reality 
as the rest of you will have quickly concluded my own concern is specifically that we not regard the possible conclusion of the current largescale assetpurchase programs as in itself raising the hurdle rate on future policy initiatives in the event that relapse seems to be occurring  its important in my view that we be clear on this point among ourselves and that we communicate it to markets and the public  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you very much and thanks to everyone for useful discussion im going to attempt here to summarize what ive heard and then make a few additional comments 
in summary the outlook improved during the intervening period particularly with respect to economic growth over the remainder of the year and most participants believe that recovery had begun although anecdotal information suggests that businesses and households remain quite cautious a number of factors should support growth over the next few quarters including reduced inventory accumulation higher auto sales and production modest increases in housing activity and prices some stabilization in household spending better financial conditions and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies 
the outlook for the medium term also seems better than at the last meeting but there remains considerable uncertainty about whether final demand growth will be sustained once government policy supports including special measures such as cashforclunkers and the firsttime homebuyers credit begin to wane  the modal view was that the recovery in 2010 could be relatively slowmaybe a checkmark laughterperhaps around the longrun potential growth rate a rate that would be too slow to reduce the unemployment rate significantly next year some suggested that downside risks to growth remained as well  inflation remains relatively low but there was some disagreement about the factors that most influence inflation in the medium term and about the risks associated with our current mix of policies 
retail sales and consumer spending have picked up a bit in part reflecting special factors such as the cashforclunkers program  some consumer fundamentals are improved  notably household wealth is rising again and labor income may be stabilizing  sentiment though still low has improved and there is possibly some pentup demand  however especially weak labor markets tight credit and the slowing of the benefits of the stimulus package seem likely to restrain consumption growth  saving rates have been relatively stable but the evolution of the saving rate remains an important uncertainty in the near term 
in the housing sector sales and starts have looked somewhat better and house prices have actually risen a bit higher house prices not only increase household wealth but they also improve the quality of mortgagerelated assets and by reducing the effective cost of capital encourage home purchase  however foreclosures are likely to continue to put pressure on prices by raising supply other risks to housing are the ending of the temporary tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and the end of the feds mbs purchase program 
activity in the nonresidential sector continues to decline sharply in most districts reflecting both worsening fundamentals and severe credit constraints  in the business sector managers are relieved that the worst scenarios have not come to pass but as already noted many remain wary and uncertain about the recovery and there is some disconnect between their perceptions and the relative strengths seen in the aggregate data 
business caution together with low utilization rates and substantial excess capacity suggest that many firms may be slow to add workers and make new capital investments  costcutting has contributed to productivity gains  the sustainability of those gains is unclear but is potentially an important issue for example in determining whether the recovery will be jobless and how slack will evolve 
manufacturing surveys show some improvement probably reflecting in part rising volumes of global trade and activity  indexes show a moderate increase in manufacturers expectations of prices paid and received  reports on retailing and services remain somewhat mixed  health care has done well transportation less so  agriculture and natural gas production have been affected by lower prices 
the labor market remains very weak but may be close to the bottom  layoffs have slowed somewhat theyre still high and ui claims are falling only gradually  gross hiring is weak wage growth is moderate presumably reflecting the weakness of the market  unemployment is expected to decline only slowly given the expectation that economic growth will not be significantly above potential next year and given the recent experience of jobless recoveries 
improvements in financial markets over the intermeeting period were not dramatic but the substantial gains in the past six months were largely sustained  risktaking and momentum have returned to the markets  the decline in longerterm treasury yields is somewhat puzzling but at least for now it is supportive of recovery  however credit risks in the banking system remain substantial particularly in residential and commercial mortgages  bank credit remains tight bank loans to smaller businesses households and commercial real estate in particular have fallen dramatically  securitization markets still are limited in their activity  banks terms continue to tighten perhaps in part due to regulatory pressures 
inflation has been relatively stable with a modest downward trend in the core and the risks around inflation seem more balanced  wages and unit labor costs are decelerating but on the other hand the dollar is weakening and commodity prices are up  participants differed on the fundamental determinants of inflation and consequently on their forecasts and emphasis on inflation expectations as a driver of inflation together with the greenbook assumption that policy will stay easy much longer than markets expect led some to worry about higher inflation in the medium term  alternatively even if slack is an unreliable determinant of inflation in normal times the very high level of slack that probably exists today could create disinflationary pressures very possibly the stability of inflation expectations as measured in financial markets or in surveys may be disguising a great deal of uncertainty about how policy and inflation will ultimately evolve 
given the long lags of policy and uncertainties about the effects of unconventional policies continued clarity about and attention to the feds policies and exit strategy are important for retaining confidence 
any comments no response okay with that let me just add a few thoughts  i come after governor tarullo so its even more difficult for me 
i think were all glad that the general view seems to be that the nearterm outlook will be better the data since the last meeting support that view  of course the question that everyone has alluded to is whether this nearterm pickup will be sustainable going into 2010  i think that this is actually a very complicated question and there are good arguments on both sides  so at the risk of being a little bit pedantic im going to do point and counterpoint and talk a bit about some of what i see as the main forces on the two sides 
if you look at the case for sustainability there are a lot of factors which suggest that final demand will be sustained next year  i think the housing market developments are particularly important in this regard and the staff has noted the improvements in houseprice outlooks  as president yellen noted this is not just a matter of wealthit potentially affects asset quality  in addition because expected price changes are part of the cost of capitalor put another way people dont want to buy houses when the prices are fallingsome sense that prices are stabilizing may be very helpful in terms of residential construction  i think it is literally the case that since ive been chairman there has not been a single quarter in which residential construction has added to the gdp laughter i wont go down as the housing chairman but the third quarter apparently may be different 
the labor market is very weak but overall as job losses have moderated and as hours have improved slightly and wages have improved slightly labor income is beginning to stabilize which is an important precondition for multiplieraccelerator developments next year 
financial markets are of course very positive and i would note that not only are they a cause of improved conditions in terms of credit availability and in terms of the positive financial feedback loop but they are also reflective of expectations  in particular developments in the stock market and the shape of the yield curve are suggestive that confidence about recovery is returning 
on the consumer side i mentioned last time that i felt comfortable with the greenbooks assumption that saving rates will be stable going forward in which case we should begin to see growth in consumption that will support a more sustained recovery  and supporting that is the fact that wealth is beginning to turn around and that the drag from the losses of wealth over the last couple of years will begin to fade over time 
the global recovery is another positive although the effects are different and work through different channels but certainly i think one of the reasons that manufacturing looks to be leading this recovery must be at least in part because of the exposure of manufacturing to trade 
finally on the sustainability side as ted truman and others have been reminding us the norm for a deep recession is a fairly strong recovery and there certainly are factors like pentup demand and inventory adjustments that tend to bring economies back faster than sometimes is anticipated 
on the other hand laughter there are some things that go against some of these basically optimistic forces  a number of people have talked about the temporary nature of many of the government programs that are supporting economic growth nowthe housing market is a clear case of that  people have mentioned the firsttime homebuyers tax credit which is now expiring presumably the fed at some point will not be able to maintain the downward pressure on mortgage rates  and there are other things going on as well including developments in the gses losses at the fha that may force them to tighten their terms and probably an increased pace of foreclosures as some of the moratoria and other delays end  so the housing market is not out of the woods by any means and the greenbook does take into account a possible relapse in house prices 
the labor market recovery looks much more like a jobless or very slow recovery than the alternative for example the ui claims although falling are doing so quite slowly and we are all aware of the fact that the duration of unemployment is quite high which is going to affect labor force attachment and skills and so on 
the productivity issue really cuts both ways as we discussed yesterday  at least in the 2001 recovery there was a close relationship between productivity at the micro level and phenomena associated with a jobless recovery  i would point out that the greenbook is not really forecasting a jobless recovery  they anticipate as i count here 22 million payroll jobs in 2010 and 38 million in 2011 being added which of course is possible but it could be weaker than that if productivity and other forces are drags 
the improvements in financial markets are very encouraging but the banking system i think remains the most important exception with credit being quite tight and potential losses being very very important in that sector  i was interested to hear governor dukes comments about the banks views visvis my own views  in general they are being very very cautious in any case about lending 
consumer spending has not yet demonstrated that it will be sustainable  cashforclunkers and other measures like the tax credits and transfers of the fiscal program are of course temporary and more broadly the fiscal stimulus will begin to decline next year as will the inventory correction 
and finally although there is a presumption that a deep recession will be followed by a strong recovery we have talked in this forum for a number of months about the many headwinds that we face including leverage issues credit issues and various imbalances for example fiscal and trade imbalances that need to be corrected 
so ive gone through all of these things not only to show you what an openminded person i am laughter but also to say that i think our views need to be fairly nuanced at this point i think the general outlook has improved and i think theres a reasonable chance for the recovery to be sustained in 2010 but there are a lot of crosscurrents that we need to pay attention to 
if i had to take a modal position i would reiterate what i said at the last meeting which is again i do anticipate the second half of this year to be pretty strong  i said so last time and i do think that the modal outlook for 2010 is for economic growth around potential maybe a little bit above potential with of course only modest effects on unemployment and job creation  a number of factors support that and the two most important factors since last time that influence my thinking are the improvements in the housing sector and house prices and the fact that global growth continues to be above expectations 
so that would be my modal forecast  i think we need to think about if you will the distribution of costs on both sides of that expectation  and putting aside the probabilities and risks i think you can make the case at this point that given how far we are from full employment given the fact that banks are just going to skirt by in terms of their ability to maintain adequate capital given the expected losses the social costs of an outcome thats weaker than we currently anticipate are on the margin greater than those if the outcome is a bit stronger than we currently anticipate  and independent of any considerations of insurance and risk aversion i think that asymmetry in the shape of the cost function ought to make us still be focused primarily on supporting recovery although we obviously need to pay close attention to the mediumterm risks that others have pointed to 
as we will discuss in the next round i think that high levels of policy stimulus are still warranted but again absolutely in the spirit of demonstrating my openmindedness i do in fact quite seriously want to talk a bit about the downsides of policy stimulus which many people have already noted clearly while inflation is not a concern now we do have to pay some attention to it because as president hoenig points out the lags can be long and variable  i think someone mentioned that before you president hoenig 
i will make one observation though on this  let me talk a bit about the determinants of inflation for just a moment  first on the output gap side i think i would like to associate myself with some things that president yellen and president evans said which is that a lot of the ambiguities in the statistical and empirical work on the output gap and inflation come from the fact that over most of the data sample the output gap is sufficiently small that it is dominated by noise it is very hard to know whether there is a gap how big it is and indeed there may be nonlinear effects of the gap on inflation let me propose a very simple analysis  just look at nber peak datesbeginnings of recessionswhich are typically known within a year or 16 months or so of the actual peak  since 1960 looking at the second and third years after the peak date from the nber in all cases total inflation has fallen in the second and third year relative to the year before the peak and in most cases quite substantially and in all but one 1973 core inflation has also fallen in most cases fairly substantially  so there does seem to be a recession effect suggesting that large output gaps do affect inflation even if the linkage is not visible for small gaps 
that being said i think inflation expectations are important and one way that shows up is that the effects of output gaps are obviously much smaller now than in the past  we saw about a 2 percentage point decline in total and core inflation after the 1990 recession and only about a 1 percentage point decline after the 2001 recession  of course this is a bigger recession than either of those two and weve already seen about a 1 percentage point decline in core but i think the direction there is correct 
i think a few people talked about looking a bit at the components of inflation  were seeing a substantial slowdown in services prices including rents which tend to be pretty inertial  so i think from that perspective we should see a slower rate of core inflation for a time and from a cost perspective unit labor costs are low as well  at the same time i recognize that of course commodity prices the dollar and so on can move pretty quickly and probably respond much more quickly to policy and policy expectations than these other factors do and so we need to take a balanced view 
i would also add that on this issue of stimulus there are other factors that i at least pay attention to in thinking about this over and above inflation per sefor example the dollar  the decline in the dollar weve been seeing has been relatively moderate  it has basically only offset the gains that we saw late last year nevertheless i think it would be very unfortunate if we had a more disorderly or more rapid decline in the dollar  it would potentially have implications for domestic interest rates it might lead to concerns about financial stability and more broadly it may exacerbate some of the problems of international economic relations and our role in the international economic order that is a longterm consideration 
governor warsh alluded to i think speculative activity in markets  frankly i dont really see any major bubbles at this point but we havent been that good at identifying them in the past and we need to pay attention i think to any kind of excesses in financial markets that might be generated by our activities 
finally i think we do have to pay attention to our balance sheet  these issues are less important of course than our macro objectives but there are political implications from large losses or difficulties in managing the balance sheet and we have to think about that certainly as part of our exit strategy 
so as a bottom line like most of you i see a strong second half as shortterm factors play out my modal forecast is for moderate growth next year  again like most of you i do think that the downside risks are significant and we need to be particularly attentive to that and i think that core inflation at least should be well controlled in the short to medium term  having said that i fully understand and sympathize with the need for a balanced approach which even as we support this economy keeps us alert to the problems of exit which are clearly already beginning and will be an important part of our deliberations for some time 
any questions or comments president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  i just wanted to make a comment about slack since thats gotten a lot of commentary in past meetings from this end of the table  i dont think anyone disputes the correlations you can find in the data or the correlations you get from the mainstream models we have  i think the question is  whats the structural link  to talk about correlations between inflation and measures of slack without talking about monetary policy is like talking about hamlet without the prince i think the point some of us would make is that you cannot rely on slack by itself the correlation you see is sort of an endogenous interaction i know you all understand this but im just responding to the sense of puzzlement about what people who have talked about slack and potential output and inflation have in mind  im just speaking for myself here 
chairman bernanke its a good point but i guess my quick reaction would be that if you look at these recession episodes i just described the role of monetary policy in those has varied quite a bit some of them earlier on were essentially caused by tight monetary policy others much less so  so i think the commonality would be an aggregate demand effect  but again id be the first to agree that none of us has a really definitive strong model of inflation although for what its worth i think the reviews of the greenbook have shown better success in forecasting inflation and output i think thats the academic result  but and i say this with all due respect to our colleagues who are doing the very best that anyone can do neither one is incredibly successful beyond a few quarters 
anything else no response okay brian would you like to open the next round 
mr madigan4 footnote 4 the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 4 end footnote 4   thanks mr chairman  ill be referring to the package 
labeled material for briefing on monetary policy alternatives  this package 
includes alternatives a and c as they were presented in the bluebook and the revised 
version of alternative b that was distributed on monday 

as was noted in the staff briefings and in your discussion so far the economic outlook has improved further  data on business investment have been stronger than expected and incoming information on home prices home sales and housing starts points to a recovery in this sector  also financial market conditions have continued to become more supportive of growth  over the intermeeting period interest rates have moved lower stock prices have climbed and the exchange value of the dollar has depreciated further providing additional impetus to aggregate demand  moreover indicators of market functioning have either held steady or improved further the stronger outlook for economic activity has been reflected in substantial upward revisions to all of the staff estimates of shortrun r including a  percentage point increase in the greenbookconsistent measure derived from the frbus model  
still these r measures remain negative and despite the positive economic 
developments the forecasted trajectory of economic activity and employment 
remains quite weak  in the staff forecast which is conditioned on an unchanged 
federal funds target range through the projection period the unemployment rate 
declines only to 9 percent by the end of next year and to about 8 percent by the end of 2011 the output gap remains correspondingly wide with real gdp still 3 percent below its potential in the fourth quarter of 2011  although fairly stable inflation expectations are expected to restrain movements in inflation the substantial output gap is still projected to push pce inflation down to 1 percent in 2011 below the inflation objectives implied by fomc participants longerrun projections  given this outlook the counterfactual optimal control simulation in the bluebook that does not impose the zero lower bound constraint would call for a reduction in the federal funds rate to minus 4 percent if that were possible  with the funds rate constrained at zero the optimal control simulations suggest that the funds rate should remain at zero until 2012 similarly simulations of the frbus model using the outcomebased policy rule prescribe holding the funds rate at zero for nearly two full years before policy firming begins  
of course significant risksboth to the upside and the downsideattend the forecast as your comments so far have underscored  on the one hand the greenbook noted that the very low current levels of household and business investment suggest the risk of a greaterthananticipated rebound in spending  on the other hand the greenbook pointed to the possibility of a further increase in the personal saving rate as well as to the risk of greater financial headwinds  certainly the incoming information from the banking sector with exceedingly weak growth in bank credit and evidence that banks continue to tighten lending terms suggests persistent restraint for the foreseeable future on spending by households and firms that are dependent on bank credit 
against this background the bluebook once again presented a set of alternatives that provided a wide range of choices for policymakers  under alternative a the committee would increase its largescale asset purchases under alternative b the committee would maintain the existing maximum sizes of its purchases and under alternative c the committee would trim back its purchases the alternatives also differ somewhat in the language of the statement 
the committee might be inclined to adopt alternative a page 2 in the package if it judged that despite the improved outlook the expected outcomes for output and employment were not satisfactory or that the downside risks to that outlook were unacceptably large the committees statement would again indicate that economic activity is leveling out and would note that conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further  however the language in the first paragraph would cite factors that could restrain economic growth and indicate that absent further policy action the recovery could be relatively weak with slack in resource utilization diminishing quite slowly  to promote a sustained economic recovery and higher resource utilization the committee would increase its planned purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities by 250 billion to 15 trillion and extend these purchases through the second quarter of 2010 staff estimates suggest that this action might lower longerterm interest rates by 15 to 30 basis points and reduce the unemployment rate two years ahead by as much as  percentage point below a baseline outlook the statement would continue to express the view that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period as shown by the red text toward the end of alternative a this draft incorporates the suggestion that the more explicit phrase low levels of resource utilization and subdued inflation be substituted for the vaguer economic conditions in explaining the committees expectation that the federal funds rate will remain very low for a protracted period 
if the committee instead judged that the current maximum amounts of its largescale asset purchases reasonably balanced the various risks confronting the economy it might be inclined toward alternative b page 3  under this alternative the committee would also maintain its forward guidance regarding the funds rate  with these policy choices largely expected by the market an announcement of alternative b seems unlikely to have much effect on market prices 
the first paragraph of alternative b would present a somewhat more upbeat picture of economic developments than that of alternative a it would note for example that economic activity has picked up albeit from a severe downturn and would attribute part of that improvement to the housing sector  however as in august the committee would also say that household spending remains constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit the statement would note that business investment and employment are still declining but at a slower pace  the statement would indicate that past policy actions and market forces will support a strengthening rather than a resumption of economic growth thus suggesting that the committee now sees a recovery as having begun and would note that these factors would contribute to higher levels of resource utilization 
paragraph 2 of alternative b would state that substantial resource slack and stable inflation expectations should help keep inflation subdued for some time  we suggested the revised language shown in blue in place of language included in the bluebook because upon further reflection it seemed best not to implicitly suggest uncertainty about whether or not inflation expectations are well anchored by using the word apparently which was included in the bluebook draft 
under alternative b the committee would maintain the existing maximum amounts for its largescale asset purchases but it would shift back the completion date for these transactions either to the end of the first quarter or to sometime in the second quarter if the committee wanted maximum optionality regarding its purchases it might retain the current up to language shown in blue brackets and extend the period of purchases into the second quarter  the longer time period for these purchases along with the up to language would provide the committee more time to decide to scale back or end these purchases before the full 125 trillion were purchased the committee might find this flexibility valuable if it saw a significant chance that economic conditions ultimately would not warrant buying the full amounts  alternatively members might see this flexibility as useful if they saw significant risks regarding the committees capacity to eventually execute an exit strategy with very high reserve balances  arguably extending the completion date into the second quarter would also allow the committee more flexibility to increase purchases in the second quarter in order to provide more stimulus in the event that the economic recovery flags that is it might be easier to ramp up purchases in the second quarter from a low level rather than from a program that had come to an end 
the cost of this flexibility would be less certainty in the markets about the ultimate size and duration of committees asset purchases and so somewhat higher mortgage and other longterm interest rates than if you committed to the maximum purchase size if instead you fully expect to purchase the current maximum amounts and want to give market participants confidence that your mbs purchases will not fall short of their expectations in order to maximize the effectiveness of your purchases you could drop the two words in brackets  as a memo from brian sack and his colleagues indicated the desk recommends tapering through the end of the first quarter given the current maximum amount of mbs purchases of 125 trillion  i should note that in the sentence on tapering and timing we recommended changing its purchases to these purchases to make clear that the specified completion date of either the first quarter or the second quarter applies only to the current purchase programs not to some possible future program 
a relatively small issue  the first sentence of paragraph 3 recognizes that various federal reserve liquidity programs have been closed or are being wound down by no longer referring to all available tools  the committee may wish to consider whether the adjective wide should be used to describe the range of tools being used to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability  there is some chance that a change to just a range of tools might be read by observers as signaling that the federal reserve was pulling back more sharply from its support programs than the revision in language was intended to suggest 
but the committee might see the recent strongerthanexpected economic data as indicating that buying less than the full 125 trillion of mbs is desirable and thus see alternative c page 4 as appropriate alternatively members might be inclined toward alternative c if they were particularly concerned about the possible implications of very high reserve balances for inflation expectations or for actual monetary stimulus in that vein a decision to purchase less than the previously specified maximum amounts might also be motivated by concern that the treasury will not rapidly rebuild balances in the sfp even after the debt ceiling is lifted thus injecting more reserves into the banking system than the committee had anticipated 
in comparison with alternative b the first paragraph of alternative c would give less emphasis to remaining economic weaknesses and downside risks  the statement would also put less stress on resource utilization and suggest less of a role for slack in restraining inflation  under this alternative the committee would indicate its intention to purchase about 1 trillion of mortgagebacked securities and about 150 billion of agency debt less than the current 125 trillion and 200 billion maximum amounts  these purchases would be tapered and completed by the end of 
this year the committee would also revise its forward rate guidance to indicate that 
the funds rate would be kept at its current exceptionally low level only so long as 
inflation remains well contained and only until the committee has greater assurance 
that the economic recovery will be sustained  with investors apparently coming to 
the conclusion recently that exceptional policy accommodation will indeed be 
maintained for a protracted period market participants would be quite surprised by a 
statement along the lines of alternative c and as discussed yesterday interest rates 
would likely jump noticeably
 
for your reference the table on the next page summarizes the alternatives and draft directives are provided on the final pages  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you brian are there questions for brian no response i understand coffee is ready we could have coffee now so that we dont break up the goround so well take 20 minutes for coffee  thank you 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke okay why dont we recommence and begin the policy goround with president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  my preferred statement for this meeting is a slight variant of alternative c for basically most of the reasons that brian madigan alluded to  i think that the committee is not yet ready to begin exiting from the extended period language of the statement  i happen to think it is time to do that and im hoping that the committee will get to that point relatively soon  so given my understanding of the committees preferences id like to address instead the language in alternative b  i think its important to try to explain to the committee my concerns and why 
i think that this debate about slack is at the core of thinking about policy and that means the phillips curve is at the core of how we think about monetary policy  in my view it is true that the data and most of the empirical research suggest that the relationship between inflation and the output gap at least the simple bivariate relationship is not terribly stableit tends to vary over time  and it tends to vary over time in part because as president lacker said the phillips curve is usually estimated as a reducedform statistical relationship  it is not necessarily a structural one one of the things that i think we know about the phillips curve relationship as it is usually thought of is that a necessary although not sufficient condition for this relationship is stable expectations of inflation  in order for us to have any predictable relationship between the output gap and inflation we need stable inflation expectations  and one of the things that is important for the stability of inflation expectations is that the public forms expectations about inflation and the actions and language of monetary policymakers can shape those expectations 
therefore my concerns are about the language we use to explain our current policy actions and how it may shape expectations going forward  and i think we have to be careful about that language so that it reflects the importance of expectations and so that it reflects the fact that expectations dont move independently of either our words or our actions  we know that expectations matter from past episodes  marvin goodfriend identifies inflations scares in 1983 and 1987 they tended to occur when the fed has tried to exploit the phillips curve by delaying in raising rates or in cutting rates after the economy has weakened  the response to both of these inflation scares was that inflation expectations were cut off by the feds reacting and raising rates to fight the inflation scare thereby preserving its credibility to maintain price stability 
i think one of the questions that the committee has to ask itself and be prepared to act on is how would it react if there were an episode where inflation expectations do begin to rise or inflation begins to rise because of fears of the size of the feds balance sheet because of fears of monetizing the debt or whatever and if that happens when slack is high and large as it is now how will the committee respond 
i think that putting expectations of inflation in paragraph 2 of the statement was a very important step forward although from a language standpoint i think it should be stronger than it is i think the statement ought to read with longerterm inflation expectations stable substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and keep inflation low  i want it to be a conditioning statement not a passive statement as if expectations were kind of an afterthought  if we can reverse those clauses it would be a more accurate statement about i think what we actually know about the phillips curve 
i also think that the language in the statement has to be consistent with giving us the option to raise rates at some time in the future when slack however you choose to measure it whether it be unemployment or outputis high  what i fear about this language and our persistent use of resource slack in the statement is that were creating the impression that we will not act in response to inflationary concerns  i think we need to be more balanced and nuanced about the nature of the language we are using to ensure that we will act if required to preserve both aspects of our dual mandate  i also worry that without both the conditioning aspects of inflationary expectations and more about preserving price stability were potentially creating a problem where the public will come to perceive that we will not act until resource utilization is high or higher at some point 
the measures of resource utilization i think are problematic  i think we have a very difficult time measuring resource utilization and i think we have a difficult time measuring inflation expectations but i dont think that absolves us of the responsibility of having to deal with both of them  choices among measures of resources utilization depend a lot not only on statistics and on measurement problems but also on what kind of model one has and different models yield different measures  at the philadelphia fed we have a dsge model sort of a workhorse neokeynesian macro model  there our resource slack measures are about minus 3 percent as opposed to minus 6 or 7 percent as in the greenbook  well what does that say they both contain measurement error clearly yet where do you start 
the question is not what we do today but what we do down the road when we reach the point where we are going to have to make a decision  and im terribly worried that we might get ourselves into a position where we cannot make that decision  as the resource gap narrows obviously well get closer and closer to facing a very difficult choice 
so i think this is really about language  its about shaping the statecontingent nature of our policy actions and those policy actions depend not just on resource slack but also on the path of inflation and inflation expectations  i think we need to make that clearer and i think the language in alternative b is unnecessarily distorted towards saying that we dont care about inflationthat policy is going to be flat for as far as the eye can see  and i think thats potentially misleading  it is also problematic because it sends a signal about how policy will react i think we have to be very worried about that and im very sensitive about that which is why my focus and my comments yesterday were a lot about expectationsnot that theyre easy to measure but that they matter a lot in this context  and i think we have to preserve our flexibility 
id like to make three points about the language in alternative b  first in paragraph 1 we added new language about a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization  im not exactly sure where that language came from  its new language  i dont know why we want to bring it back in id prefer just to see us say strengthening of economic growth and eliminate the phrase and gradual return to higher resource utilization and in the context of price stability i have real problems with in the context of price stability i dont know what that means  it seems to convey that somehow were not responsible for that context or that we dont have to be accountable for itits sort of an environmental factor that we react to  i think higher inflation and higher inflation expectations should not be treated as an environmental factor  they should be something we take responsibility for  second in paragraph 2 i have already suggested that i would prefer to see with longerterm expectations stable as the opening clause as a conditioning clause that says that is what permits slack to keep inflation contained  and third as to the up to phrases i think it is terribly important that we keep up to  even if were not ready to cut i think given the nature of the recovery if we stretch this out too far we may find ourselves in this conundrum of buying mbs and maybe trying to raise rates at the same time in which case undoubtedly we would stop buying mbs  so i think we need that up to language 
i think this debate is really about forming the language and the expectations of the path of monetary policy not about what inflation is doing today or maybe even what it is going to be doing next quarter or the quarter after that  i have no fears of inflation in the near term but its about shaping the longer term about keeping our options open so that we have the ability to act and do act when the time comes  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b the greenbook forecasts disinflation and high unemployment rates over the next two years i agree with this forecast these outcomes occur with an assumption that the federal funds rate will remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time so i am very comfortable continuing to say that in the statement 
in terms of the lsap program we should purchase the entire 1 trillion in mortgagebacked securities we should also taper the program though i would prefer to leave the completion date flexible depending on market conditions  i have a strong preference not to end the program prematurely 
i agree with presidents evans and yeltsinyellenlaughter 
mr fisher ive gone drinking with janet  shes no yeltsin  laughter 
chairman bernanke okay the last two minutes will be struck  laughter 
mr rosengren continuing with my statement that persistently high unemployment is likely to result in low and falling inflation  this suggests that we will need to maintain an accommodative stance for some time to come  we have only tentative signs of a recovery at this point and we should not take actions that risk reversing these initial positive signs 
i too have a couple of comments on the language  i would remove up to for two reasons not completing the 1 trillion purchase will signal that we are content with the path where inflation is below my target and the unemployment rate is above my target through the forecast horizon  i do not want to send such a signal  second housing is improving  however the firsttime homebuyer tax incentive is ending at the end of november and i would not want our support for housing to end at the same time  i would also change the sentence on tapering to remove the last clause and instead say the committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets  this would provide flexibility in tapering and highlight our goal of ensuring a smooth transition  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  now that the economy has stabilized and looks as if its beginning to recover albeit perhaps tentatively i think its time to start calibrating our policy stance a little more carefully you argued i think quite convincingly for the array of factors affecting the outlook and obviously the implication is the great uncertainty about just how that balance of forces is going to play out  and you argued compellingly i think as well for nuance in our views and i think that needs to be reflected in our policy stance as well 
the maximum amounts for our purchase programs were set back in march amidst the bleakest days of the recession we made very rough estimates of what was needed based on the best analysis we could muster coming into that meeting  but if you read the transcript we changed those numbers on the fly  things looked potentially very grim and we picked large numbers and raised them during the meeting and i think it was out of a sense that we wanted to convey credibility to our commitment to do what it took  but to some extent looking back on that and looking back at the deliberative process the numbers were somewhat arbitrary at the time  we deliberately set maximums rather than predetermined amounts so that we could take advantage of incoming information and adjust our plans accordingly  we explicitly have acknowledged in our statements that we would monitor programs and make adjustments as warranted 
weve talked a lot at this meeting and previous meetings about the extent to which until now our asset purchases have just amounted to our displacing shortterm borrowing and about the fact that our shortterm borrowing has had us basically accommodating an elevated demand for reserves and about the fact that we havent perhaps done much by quantitative easing until maybe the last couple of months perhaps we did so as well in the february to may time frame i dont know but as i said yesterday i think were at the point where from here on out every additional purchase represents additional monetary stimulus in the quantitative easing sense as if we were continuing to cut rates 
i would point out again over 300 billion is going to be added to reserve balances from mbs settlements and the runoff in the sfp and new mbs purchases would provide additional reserves on top of that if we continue with our asset purchases my sense is that thats going to give us further declines in rates albeit from very low levels and albeit of an uncertain amount and ill acknowledge that it could be small as bill englishs analysis yesterday showed  but my sense is that were going to get more stimulus than the greenbook assumes  again how much more is quite hard to know obviously 
a couple of other factors are relevant here at least to my thinking  first of all its not clear what net stimulus the mbs purchases are providing over and above their effect on reserves if you look at the ois spread which has been relative to its historic fluctuations essentially near zero for a lot of this year it suggests we have gotten to the point where maybe mbs which are issued by an entity that is after all in government receivership is a perfect substitute for treasuries and you would expect at that point that buying mbs is just like buying treasuries 
we talked earlier this year about the effect of different purchase program strategies whether to buy treasuries or mbs the staff did the best job it could with limited data and limited natural experiments to go on to give us a sense of what yields would do  but they didnt give us any evidence that would refute the hypothesis that you would come to naturally from just looking at a standard model namely that if were successful in driving down mbs rates then that would come at the expense of raising rates elsewhere in the economy  it has never been clear to me that lowering mortgage rates is on net stimulative to the economy  and ill admit we dont have much evidence one way or the other but its hard for me to rule out the notion that were just shifting credit from one sector of the economy to the other 
im happy to stipulate as vice chairman dudley requests that we are not worried about an exit strategy im sure we can find an exit  the question is which exit we want to take im fine with the idea that we can find an exit strategy that raises rates but i think theres an important question as to what we are going to exit to what regime were going to be in afterwards and i think the open question has to do with how big our balance sheet is and whats in it when we finally exit  im sure theres going to be resistance to selling mbs down the roadi can just sense it our plans are to hold on to it let it roll off there would be political headwinds on that so im reluctant to have us essentially be the housing lender of last resort  and it strikes me as odd that we would head towards a configuration of our balance sheet in which were issuing nonmonetary liabilities to fund housing debtthe political economy of that for a central bank just strikes me as odd  and i think we ought to strive to avoid it 
so all of these factors make me wary of increasing our mbs portfolio any more than we need to im not ready to say now that we ought to scale back and cancel all the rest of the purchases but i think we need to leave our options open  between now and the next meeting i think well learn a lot about this quantitative easing question if the projections are correct  so i would argue strongly for retaining the up to language 
on other questions i like the idea of tapering  i like president rosengrens suggestion of language that is less committal about the timing  in particular if we do include the phrase second quarter the preposition in implies that were going to get all the way there so it might be better to say by the second quarter or by the end of the second quarter  that way were not committing to purchase enough to get us to the second quarter  and im happy with dropping the word wide thank you very much mr chairman 
chairman bernanke i just wasnt quite clear on your last point  what was your preferred language for the end of that sentence 
mr lacker well if were going to do second quarter it should be by the second quarter or by the end of the second quarter rather than in the second quarter which implies we get all the way there 
chairman bernanke i see okay thank you president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  i can support alternative b today but i do so reluctantly i think our asset purchases especially our mbs purchases have been successful in lowering longerterm borrowing costs and supporting the housing sector and the broader economy  in addition i believe our toolkit to remove accommodation when the time comes is ample  that said i agree that further expansion of our mbs program entails some risks and possible costs along with the benefits 
given the improvement in the economic outlook and in financial conditions since our last meeting im not prepared to argue for an expansion of the program today  but i strongly agree with vice chairman dudley and president rosengren that we need to complete the full 1 trillion in mbs purchases that markets now anticipate and id like to do so in a manner that is least disruptive to the mortgage market  i therefore favor striking the words up to in alternative b curtailing our purchases at this late stage in the program would likely push up mortgage rates and i believe it would be taken as a signal of an earlier exit from nearzero interest rates than markets now consider likely 
in addition to removing the words up to i would like to soften some of the language concerning the timing and completion of the program  and following president rosengrens suggestion i think we dont need to announce a definite end date for the program at all and i would support his suggestion this would give added flexibility i think to the desk in gearing the timing of the phasedown to evolving marketing conditions  if we do end up giving a time frameq1 or q2i would like to propose that we substitute the word executed for completed in paragraph 3 of alternative b in other words to say that we anticipate that they will be executed by say the end of the first quarter or however thats decided  i think that substitution subtly distinguishes our characterization of the treasury program where we use the term completed from our mbs purchases  i believe that leaves the door slightly more open to ramping up the pace of our purchases again if the recovery does end up suffering a significant setback and we facegovernor tarullo what was the name you gave the scenario 
mr tarullo relapse 
ms yellen a relapse scenario in that event the balance of costs and benefits of further mbs purchases could reverse so i do not want further expansion of mbs purchases or other initiatives to be entirely off the table   
although i can agree to leave the size of our mbs program at 1 trillion today i see a strong case on policy grounds for further monetary stimulus  core inflation is currently below my price stability goal of about 2 percent and the unemployment rate is well above my full employment goal of about 5 percent  i anticipate a tepid recovery but even if the recovery is somewhat more robust this situation will persist for many years 
i am pretty sure that if it were possible we would at this point have taken the federal funds rate into negative territory that would be consistent with our historical behavior with optimal policy calculations such as those reported in the bluebook and with the guidance of most policy rules unfortunately so far this year the nominal funds rate has been fixed near zero while core inflation has fallen so the real funds rate has risen  in this sense monetary policy has actually tightened this year although circumstancesnamely the increase in unemployment and decline in core inflationseem to call for more monetary stimulus  even taking account of our largescale asset purchases i think the effective degree of easing given the dislocation in financial markets likely has been modest relative to past recessions 
i agree with president plosser that communications are a logical device to use and i think the most obvious way to provide additional stimulus without further balance sheet expansion is to use language designed to bring market expectations of the funds rate path into closer alignment with the greenbook path thereby lowering mediumterm rates  market expectations concerning the likely path of the funds rate have come down over the intermeeting period but there is still a gap between market expectations and the greenbook path which coincides with my own preferred path to help narrow that gap i propose replacing the language in paragraph 3 of alternative b with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative a specifically i would replace the vague phase economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period with the alternative phrasing stating that the committee anticipates that low resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels  this language would indicate to markets that the fomc will not raise rates merely on the basis of strong economic growth if in fact we are nowhere near maximum sustainable levels of employment and activity and if inflation is subdued  it would provide a conditional statement that would usefully inform the expectations of financial market participants  i know that this phrasing will not appeal to those members of the committee who reject the notion that slack influences inflation  but it is consistent with the language of b that already embraces the logic of such a linkage 
chairman bernanke thank you governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b and ill discuss some of the different language choices in a second  there are three premises to my policy recommendations  the first is that the most likely outcome for the economy even with rates very accommodative for an extended period is still unsatisfactory  its less unsatisfactory than it was at the last meeting the meeting before that and the meeting before that but its still unsatisfactory one of our legislative objectives is high employment which i take to be somewhere in the neighborhood of the nairu  even if the nairu is higher than 5 or 5 percent we are going to be in my view above that for a long long time  furthermore inflation is more likely to be below the 2 percent that most members of this committee favor for an objective than above it so i think were going to be away from our legislative objectives for a while i agree with president hoenig and president plosser that were going to have to raise rates before we get to full employment  weve always done that and were going to have to do it again as well as anticipate getting there  but i just think that the size of the output gapeven given a range of estimatesand the likelihood that the economic recovery is going to be gradual suggest that it will be at least an extended periodwhatever that isbefore we have to do that  so one implication is that i dont think we need to tighten in any way shape or form in response to the better outlook the better outlook just gets us to a less bad place 
the second premise is that were in a liquidity trap  reserves and other shortterm obligations particularly riskless obligations are pretty much perfect substitutes  banks will hold more reserves now without much if any effect on other interest rates  so i dont view additional reserve provision as an easing of policy and its certainly not comparable with reducing interest rates now these reserves could be stimulative in the futurei agree with thatif riskadjusted returns on bank loans and securities begin to look favorable relative to the rate were paying on deposits but they dont look favorable nowwe got that from the survey bill english reported on i think that when they begin to look favorablewhen we begin to see the movement we were looking at beforei think we can begin to exit 
that leads me to my third premise which is that we do have the tools or the staff is in the process of making us the tools to neutralize or absorb reserves and raise rates when we need to do so the efficacy of those tools is not materially affected by 200 billion or 300 billion more of reservestheyll work just as well  now i agree mr chairman this is something we need to continue to worry about and to work on  but i am confident that we will be successful in designing the exit tools  using them is something else but we will have the tools when we need them 
that leads me to some comments on alternative b  i think paragraph 1 strikes about the right balance things are looking better but its not clear how much better  the labor market remains very weak  weve had all of one month of an increase in sales in the retail control group so to say that consumption is really on a strong upward track i think is a very very tenuous conclusion so i think that paragraph is about right 
with respect to the last sentence that president plosser discussed i view this sentence as a forecast rather than an objectivewere forecasting that this is going to happen  however when we reference what we will do its in the first sentence of paragraph 3  specifically when we reference our tools we say we will employ our tools to preserve price stability thats a key message and i agree with you president plosser that its critical to keep that message in there but i dont see it being contradicted by the last sentence of paragraph 1  i like the addition of the gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization  now that the economy has turned around and is improving our actions arent keyed just to whether the economy is growing or not but also to how fast its growing so i thought this was a good addition 
in paragraph 3 id like to focus on a couple of things  i think the shift from all available tools to a range or a wide range of tools is a nontrivial shift in tone and will be noticed  i think its fair to say that our intention is not to use all available tools if the economy follows something like the baseline forecast because there are costs to using these tools relative to the benefits but i think as governor tarullo said if the economy is less robust if inflation continues to decline if inflation expectations start following inflation downand i think there is a significant risk of thatthe committee should consider using longerterm lsaps and lowering the rate on excess reserves  and certainly under those circumstances ill be arguing for those actions with inflation coming down the adverse effectsthat is the costs in terms of potential inflation expectationswill be much less than they might have been before  i do not interpret the change in language here as ruling out the possibility of using those tools if circumstances change and dont turn out the way we want them to be and i wanted to make that clear to the rest of the committee  i think its important to retain the extended period  i dont know whether that means 2011 or the second half of 2010 but even if its the second half of 2010 thats quite a ways from now and its way too early to signal anything 
i would taper the agencies down and i dont feel that we have to go to the full 200 billionif we fall short of it thats fine  so i would certainly keep the up to for the agencies with respect to the mbs i would taper that also but in the context of announcing that well complete the program  i think completing it is what the market expectsits built into rates not doing so would raise interest rates  i dont know by how muchit could be 5 basis points it could be 35 basis pointsbut im pretty sure the direction it would go in and given my outlook for the economy thats not the right thing to do  to me that would be a tightening of policy relative to market expectations  and i do think markets also expect that the additional purchases will result in more reserves and if theyre thinking in quantitative easing terms theyve probably also built that into market prices  so i think not completing it would be contrary to expectations and would be a tightening of policy and as vice chairman dudley noted yesterday i think the effect to be concerned abouteven more than the rise of a few basis pointswould be the signaling that were getting ready to exit a lot of things very quickly  so although i dont think keeping up to in there would be a major problem i do think it would leave uncertainty i think now is the logical time to announce the full programs consistent with what we did with the treasury why leave markets uncertain so i would delete up to in front of the agency mortgagebacked securities phrase  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  as i see it current fomc policy has three parts one part is our liquidity programs one part is an asset purchase program and the third part is a nearzero interest rate policy 
the liquidity programs are running off and in my view that seems to be going smoothly  i would see that as the panic receding and as our having performed our lenderoflastresort function by developing liquidity programs to address the crisis 
on the nearzero rate policy if you look at the previous two recessions it was about two and a half to three years before a rate move following the end of a recession  so it could be that this fomc is different from previous incarnations and i do think that the too low for too long argument will weigh heavy on us in the coming quarters  but just taking the staff forecast at face value and taking the experience in the previous two recessions we are looking at a rate move in the first half of 2012 if you believe that back of the envelope estimate  during the interim more shocks are going to hit the economy  in my mind the question is how to run an active monetary policy to be able to react to these shocks while your interest rate policy is going to remain on hold for some period it seems to me like any reaction it would have to come through asset purchases so the question is how to do this 
the policy were contemplating to me looks like this  were contemplating ending the assetpurchase program in the first half of 2010 and were contemplating letting the natural runoff draw down the purchased mbs over a period of several years as long as six years  a round number for that runoff is 200 billion a year so lets just tuck that away and keep that in mind  were going to use other tools to control the flow of excess reserves into the money supply if we should get into a situation where the excess reserves start to move in that direction  in my view theres nothing optimal about relying on this natural runoff  this is just an unconditional decline regardless of how news arrives about economic performance  so in my view the question would be can we do something that leaves the committee in a better position to control this situation 
heres my suggestion  i think we could taper as suggested by the staff but not to a full exit from the mbs purchase program or more generally asset purchase program as suggested by president rosengren president yellen and many others in the discussion just now  in my view if we quit the program altogether it will be harder to make adjustments  of course you could always come back and say im going to restart the program but its going to be very difficult and it would take a big event to get that going  so one idea would beand i talked about this last timeto taper to a very low number a number that makes sense to me just to fix ideas in our head would be something like 4 billion per week  that would add up to roughly 200 billion a year and i would leave it to the desk as to the best way to transition to that 
you could think of that maybe as a neutral policy thenyoud be replacing the natural runoff and youd still have a program that was intact  then you could take action from there depending on how conditions evolve and how the recovery evolves going forward  so this is one way to go to a much lower growth rate of mbs purchases  by keeping the program open we can react as news arrives on the economy  if the recovery is unexpectedly soft or we face renewed problems we could increase the pace of purchases though probably not up to numbers like 50 billion a week if the recovery is unexpectedly robust we could consider selling some amount per week probably without too much market disruption  of course we would do all of this in conjunction with other tools such as interest on reserves and reverse repos 
one idea about going in this direction is that it might help us avoid an early pullback from our quantitative easing program like the one that doomed the japanese quantitative easing program in the early part of this decade  i dont think we want to get into that boat  im describing an alternative strategy for where to place the asset purchase program in 2010  the discussion today is mostly about tapering and the size of the mbs program  my proposal is to think less about the size of the program in an absolute sense and more about how we might want to adjust the program going forward based on incoming information  i would agree with president lacker that as long as we continue to purchase assets were implementing a policy of further easing  so i dont really see how were pulling back in any sense on that  the liquidity programs are running off but i see those as related to the panic 
for today i support alternative b with some caveats  like president plosser i think we should retain the up to language to retain flexibility  im talking about transitioning to a slow pace of purchases but not to zero in a reasonable time frame  we may end up at a level of anywhere between 1 trillion to 125 trillion but it does not have to be 125 trillion  for the agency debt it may be reasonable to stop short of the 200 billion given the market disruption and the difficulties there so like governor kohn i would want to retain flexibility by keeping the up to language 
i prefer the second quarter of 2010 for the transition  i guess my idea was at least for today that would give us some room to continue to adjust our program at future meetings and maybe move to this small flow purchases model at some future date 
and lastly i think it is entirely appropriate as in alternatives b and c to mention the stability of inflation expectations in paragraph 2 when talking about the inflation outlook  in my view this better reflects modern theories of inflation determination and i think views around the table i think most everyone talks about slack in the context of stable inflation expectations  as i said yesterday im actually suspicious of how anchored these expectations really are  i think were seeing a lot of faith in the fed even in the face of our unprecedented policy actions  my sense is that informed opinion on inflation is as widely dispersed as it has been at any time since the 1970s in the united states  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke so president bullard you said that you wanted to retain up to did you have a thought on the next sentence about the tapering that would fit with your proposal 
mr bullard starting with the red part 
chairman bernanke the committee will gradually 
mr bullard the committee will gradually slow 
chairman bernanke it says it will be completed 
mr bullard i would like to leave it more open  i dont have exact language was this what you were proposing president rosengren 
mr rosengren i was talking about putting a period after markets and taking out the last clause 
mr lacker those seem consistent 
mr bullard i wasnt sure if what he was suggesting was consistent with what i said 
chairman bernanke president rosengren and president yellen suggested saying gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets  let me just say now that i think that theres an important interaction between that decision and the up to decision if were going to be unclear about our time frame and unclear about the final amount those two things together are somewhat concerning  but thats one possibility 
mr bullard i guess my thought was just to take it to the second quarter and then if you wanted to go this direction you could do so at a future meeting 
chairman bernanke okay thank you 
vice chairman dudley mr chairman a twohander 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  i think that i have some sympathy with taking out the first quartersecond quarter but we have to recognize that the desk has to have instructions on what it actually has to do so theres an issue of what their baseline is in terms of their action  if we take out the language about first quartersecond quarter there still needs to be an understanding in terms of what is communicated to the desk so that at least they know the starting point of the taper trajectory 
chairman bernanke thank you president hoenig 
mr hoenig thank you mr chairman  as i look at the circumstances that were in i would prefer alternative c  and i dont say that lightly and i dont say it because i dont happen to be voting i dont have to put it out therethats an issue sometimes 
i think its important that we look at the stance of policy and were in a very accommodative stance today  and looking ahead to 2010 2011 2012 were still going to have a reasonably accommodative policy  i recognize that the shortrun costs are always right before us and i dont want to stanch this recovery any more than anyone else does and that is a major concern i remember perhaps unfortunately sitting around worrying about 1 percent inflation in 2002 and 2003 worrying whether we would have deflation and worrying about shortrun issues as we kept rates low for an extended period of timei think that was our language  i just want to make sure that were thinking about the longrun costs of this much stimulus and of the difficulties we will face ahead in withdrawing it because weve never before used these tools to neutralize this much stimulus  we have enormous reserves in and already some of the chasing yield has begun with this amount of funds out there and available  we are taking on not only risk in the short term and on the downside but by delaying we also are taking on longerterm risks which may seem easier to take on precisely because they are longer term  so im very sensitive to that 
i also am very sensitive to the fact that this might surprise the market and that is a very serious worry but at some point i think we need to surprise the market to some degree and that is why i was so interested in what the basispoint effect on mortgage rates would be as well as the psychological effect but i think its a risk that we need to take on at this point because if we dont announce this now we will be very close to yearend at our next meeting and i dont think we can then say that were really pulling this stuff back  at that point i think wed be even more reluctant to do it so now we can shoot for yearend  we could tell them were not getting out now and were going to move this very carefully towards yearend  in the long run i suspect that wed havei cant say better outcomesreasonable outcomes 
there are a couple of other things  i would push for first quarterif at all possible  also im uneasy with the phrase extended period because it has been such an issue with me in the past so ill end with that thank you 
chairman bernanke i infer that you want to keep the up to though 
mr hoenig up to yes laughter safe bet 
chairman bernanke okay thats what i thought  president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  like so many others im also going to support alternative b to me its the staythecourse alternative at this stage  so many have said that the recovery is under way but fragile or tentative so i think it is still appropriate to be cautious about that and the inflation outlook in my mind doesnt warrant a policy response  i think theres a great deal of consensus around the table about the state of the economy and the outlook so it strikes me that this is really more about the language in the statement and the way we communicate with markets and the public which is to some degree more in the realm of psychology 
as i think about that i certainly believe that paragraph 1 is sufficient to convey an accurate depiction of the economy as it stands today and im comfortable enough with it  i do think its important to convey a commitment that we are going to stay the course to follow through i think the removal of the up to language conveys this i dont have terribly strong feelings about it so im certainly not going to argue strongly if the consensus is to keep it  i do think its a small change but it does help build confidence that well follow through with the programs that we have in place  at this point i dont think we want to suggest an itchy trigger finger regarding exit 
i have a couple of other comments on the suggested language again im a bit ambivalent about the inclusion of the word wide  i think it could generate a lot of speculation about what we mean by it and i think continuing with the language of simply a range of tools which is a little more measured is adequate   
there are a lot of language revisions already on the table and its going to be difficult to sort all of them out so i wont add to them  but i would make the final comment that the difference of opinion around the table is more about language than it is about the conditions   and i agree with your comment mr chairman on the need for a nuanced policy  im a little concerned about a too nuanced statement that tries to capture all of those sentiments  so i tend to prefer much of whats on the page now and whats been proposed along with the removal of up to i think that will convey the necessary continuity and followthrough that we want  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president fisher 
mr fisher mr chairman i submitted comments on september 16  many of them were incorporated in the statement  i dont want to repeat myself  i assume brian they are somewhere in the record 
someone at the end of the table mentioned hamlet and the prince earlier and it brought to mind the debate over the b2 bomber which was b2 or not b2 that is the question laughter it seems to me that what this discussion is all about is up to or not up to that is the question by my count we have had four in favor of keeping up to and four in favor of striking or deleting up to  im in favor of keeping up to because i think it gives us maximum flexibility  im in favor of incorporating the phrase these purchases and i would favor president yellens executed by the end of the first quarter  i would strike the word wide because a range is a range  i dont think wide adds much  it does probably raise some questions of what other ideas we might have up our sleeves and it might raise questions that we are not able to answer  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b  it seems that this is the most disparate set of commentary ive heard on policy alternatives  its a very interesting meeting and i hope i can add to that spirit  laughter the economy is beginning the recovery phase i think the risk profile is betterits more balanced  that doesnt change the fact that its not a very desirable path as many have pointed out the unemployment rate is going to remain high for quite some time  in terms of the inflation outlook it seems to me that were going to be undershooting our implicit objective in that were likely to stay below i would say a 1 percent inflation rate for some period of time  there is a wide range of risk as we have said and as president yellen mentioned by some estimates of the tips inflation compensation markets compensations up and that must mean that the variability in inflation is up higher or lower i find that quite interesting 
mr chairman i agree with you that viewing the balance of the social costs that we are facing those costs seem a little towards the downside  with that in mind looking at paragraph 1 my reaction was different from president plossers and more like governor kohns regarding the phrase a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability this seems to me the only place where we can possibly point out that the unemployment rate will remain high over some period of time  the only other reference to job loss is with respect to its influence on consumption  we could change resource utilization to something more like the unemployment rate will gradually decline but im not anticipating many people would prefer that type of language  and i view the phrase in a context of price stability as consistent with the observation that inflation is going to remain below 2 percent for a couple of years we can disagree on that but thats how i view that sentence so i found it to be quite good 
in terms of policy i think were responding appropriately according to the circumstances  monetary policy is accommodative  the federal funds rate is about zero weve got our largescale asset purchase programs and theres no real expectation that the funds rate is going to rise in the foreseeable futurenine to twelve months maybe it will be longer  im sympathetic to the arguments that the current path of the recovery is highly undesirablewed like a lower unemployment rate  but i just think that there are limits to our policy effectiveness  i think i am different from many of the views expressed here  given the limitations i see in our effectiveness at this point i think were at a pretty good position and i dont think that we can really do that much more 
so i favor alternative b having heard some of the comments that you made mr chairman and that the vice chairman made on our exit tools at the end of the day i do trust that our exit tools are going to be sufficient to allow us to embark upon a more restrictive policy when we deem that appropriate  if we can sell our assets i think that will work if interest on reserves doesnt work 
in terms of mbs heres where ill be different  i prefer a definitive choice today  i just dont see any benefit to postponing what strikes me as the inevitable purchase of 1 trillion after listening to everybody around the table  i would be aghast if we found a way not to do 1 trillion why not recognize that now inject a little more certainty into markets on that score  i think that if we leave it open we are going to struggle with this issue later in terms of the rate effect we dont fully appreciate why mbs yields are lower  is it the stock effect or is it the flow effect  well theres an unfortunate aspect to putting a lot of weight on the flow effectas brian at one point said maybe its 5050  if its 5050 then when we are done those rates will go back up because the flow will no longer be there  if we have to look higher rates in the eye in the first quarter of next year i think were going to be wringing our hands over it now maybe thats the right thing  i dont have a problem with being definitive now and then saying that circumstances are such that we need to apply more accommodation  we did that all the time with the funds rate and i just dont think that these policies ought to be that different  so i would prefer a more definitive choice  because of that i guess ill make it five and fivei would take out the up to well see how that goes  i would like to complete it as soon as possiblein the first quarter and i wouldnt mind the middle of the first quarterbut thats a minority view im sure  i thought that president plossers suggestion on moving the inflation expectations ahead of resource slack was perfectly acceptable if there was any appetite for that  thanks mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b  it is good to see more data showing that the economy is on a path to recovery but as i noted earlier the gains have been very limited and the recovery remains quite fragile  my view about the direction of inflation is more balanced fortunately inflation expectations have been a lot more stable than we might have anticipated even a few months ago when we were concerned that inflation expectations would fall i attribute this stability at least in part to our communications strategy  given the minimal extent of the recovery so far and the very moderate levels of inflation i believe the continuation of our current accommodative policy is appropriate 
regarding the language in paragraph 3 i support inserting the word wide in the first sentence i also think that we will be purchasing and should be purchasing the entire 1 trillion in mortgagebacked securities  in addition i think its important to be as transparent as we can be so i would delete the up to in front of the 1 trillion of agency mortgagebacked securities i would obviously leave the up to in front of the 200 billion in agency debt  regarding the language on tapering our purchases brian sackss comments and analysis yesterday moved me to support using the end of the first quarter language in that section  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  first vice president lyon 
mr lyon thank you mr chairman  i also favor alternative b  although the recent data have generally surprised on the upside im hesitant to place too much emphasis on one or two months worth of data  we have been unpleasantly surprised several times in the last two years and in part as a result im disinclined to change policy quite yet 
i think that market expectations are particularly important at times like these and i place a fair amount of weight on the fact that alternative b is most closely aligned with existing market expectations in this regard while i prefer the retention of the up to language due to its consistency with prior statements i would not object to the removal of this language 
the tapering strategy for the purchases of agency mbs and agency debt specified in alternative b strikes me as prudent and appropriate  i support ending these purchases in the first quarter of next year based on brians presentation yesterday i dont see the need or the justification to extend them further 
given that neither inflation nor inflation expectations have increased worries about the size of our balance sheet seem to me to be premature  in my view we have viable exit strategies available that we can implement as conditions warrant  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  ill support alternative b with some suggestions but ill confine most of my remarks to the mortgage markets  let me begin by talking about this odd market dynamic which i think is leading to much of the discussion around the table the mortgage market strikes me as neither particularly sustainable in its current form nor twosided in the sense of matching private parties who meet at some market clearing price and the blame for that is not even predominantly because of the federal reserves role in the market   
when i think about the mortgage market ecosystem i break it into three parts  the mortgage origination market even dominated by three or four banks with different degrees of implicit and explicit support is by far and away the most competitive market in this ecosystem compared with what im going to talk about next  in between the originators and the holders of these portfolios we have this odd duopoly of government guarantors that are now competing with a new entity the federal housing administration all of whom have confused and overlapping objective functions and confused exit regimes  they cant say what theyre solving for whether its minimizing draws from treasury maximizing the support of congress or minimizing or changing the number of folks that go into foreclosure the guarantors are in between this bizarre group of mortgage originators and buyers  and who are the buyers  well the buyers are us that is the federal reserve the treasury department and fannie and freddie who have mixed views about whether theyre also going to be portfolio buyers of whole mortgages or mortgagebacked securities  taking all this together i think we shouldnt be surprised that were having a hard time figuring out what the incremental change in spreads would be based on whether we do up to or not up to at various sizes 
all of these pieces are subject to debate  markets are trying to figure out whos going to do what to whom and what the consequences of this bizarre ecosystem are and noting that this market is not clearing in any effective way  i would say again that we have participated in but are not predominant in that rather unfavorable diagnosis 
in light of that dynamic and whats in the realm of the possible we can talk about losses on our portfolio and we can talk about complications for the exit strategy  but i think as one of the prior speakers made clear that for the purposes of this discussion we can stipulate that we can and will figure it out i have great confidence in that 
it strikes me that the central question is  what can we do to provide whatever help is in the realm of the possible to this targeted mortgage market  i think its likely that given the uncertainties that weve all spoken about regarding the real economy and financial markets in 2010 were going to have to provide support as best we can throughout much of the year  this isnt support such that we say boy once were done with the first quarter all will be rosy thereafter as a way to frame what the operative choices are in front of us i ask myself  what is most conducive to bringing private buyers back into this confused market in as seamless a way as possible  now we shouldnt be surprised that markets want more  again i said this with treasuries and its equally true here because were doing more  they want more purchases more certainty more commitment and i think that that is as expected  what should we want i think we should be solving for bringing real investors back into this market to give it any chance of pricing mortgages at rates that are conducive to recovery  so i think that brings us to the operative questions mostly in paragraph 3 
with respect to the up to language i learned from one of you that in the academy they say the debates are so angry because the stakes are so small  i think thats true on the up to language here markets expect were going to do 125 trillion  if we leave up to in there theyre going to expect it and if we take it out they expect it so i cant get all that energized over where to cast my vote in this very close call  because they already expect were going to do the whole thing and because we are reasonably comfortable with the progress from the last fomc meeting to this one i would have a mild preference for leaving up to in there and i think that the differences in market practicality here are really quite small 
what about the timing  when should we end this or complete this exercise i am generally in the category of flexibility given these uncertainties but taken to its extreme i think the flexibility would give not only the desk some concerns about what exactly theyre solving for but also the markets  therefore while im sympathetic to the idea of extending this out in general i think if we want market investors to get back in and to prepare to get back in we should tell them when were planning on exiting this thing because i think were going to have cliff effects at any point that we complete these purchases  i suspect that we should give them as much notice as possible  my preference as a result would be to say that we are going to complete or execute this by the end of the second quarter of 2010 giving full warning to them and to all of us about how to proceed 
as a final comment mr chairman on the agency debt i think the staff has been incredibly up front with us that were really making that market even harder to operate effectively  i think the benefits that we are drawing from continuing to be in that market are particularly limited if not zero  so if i had the pen i would actually end the increases in the agency debt side i dont think thats the center of consensus around the table  so just to be practical you can leave that as up to as well  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you governor duke 
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  everybody around this table has more experience with these issues than i do  
mr tarullo no thats not true  laughter 
ms duke  but im struck as i look at the statements and as i listen to the discussion that it sounds like were doing one smooth maneuver that has been the same over a period of time when the underlying dynamics are really very different  i would agree with president lacker that the purchases of the mbs and the support of the housing markets has been smooth has acted as a substitute for the financial markets that havent yet restarted  but on the other hand the waxing and waning of programs on the asset side of the balance sheet are going to result in bursts of quantitative easing in the form of reserves and were just beginning to see that given my impression that reserves are currently at desired levels i think that it will result in some lowering of interest rates  i would disagree with governor kohn on that and then disagree with president lacker and agree with president yellen that this is not necessarily a bad thing that its probably warranted by the conditions that we are facing  also i would point out that while the talf is supporting lending on the one hand our regulatory policies are generally acting to restrict credit on the other so those two things are working at crosspurposes perhaps 
with all of these different things going on i have difficulty weighing the relative impact of each one on the final outcomes but i do remain concerned that on balance were going to see too little credit availability leading to too much saving and a slower recovery than we would like  so i do support alternative b i think through tapering we actually are likely to learn a little bit more about the effects of stock versus flow as well as about the bank response to this second big tranch of reserves coming in so it certainly would be possible in the future to argue for an extension into the second quarter but im not sure whether that would be through more gradual tapering or through an increase in the purchases i think it just depends on how those develop 
in keeping with my banker roots i do find paragraph 1 awfully rosy compared with the reservations that were expressed in the policy round but i dont have any changes to offer 
i would delete the up to language but again im not sure im terribly strongly in favor of that i would probably also use the first quarter again saying that in the future i may prefer the second quarter thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  i can support alternative b although like president yellen not without some reluctance  i have two difficulties with the language of alternative b as drafted  in paragraph 1 although i think it does reflect accurately our sense of the current trajectory of the economy i dont think it captures the level of uncertainty about what may happen next year and thus i would be substantially more comfortable with an explicit indication of that uncertainty 
with respect to paragraph 3 i think president bullard captured the most important point from my point of view which is that the world should understand that were prepared to respond as required by economic circumstances  i worry that there is a sense of finality that is projected in the language as currently drafted and i dont think it turns on the up to language for the reasons that governor warsh suggested  i think it turns more upon the way its stated and to be perfectly honest upon a lot of external commentary which has begun to impute a certain finality to us so whether through the mechanism that president bullard suggested or president rosengren suggested or some other means i would be substantially more comfortable with alternative b if it states in more or lessand i say more or less given that we are a central bankexplicit fashion that we are prepared to respond to changing economic conditions so that people do understand this is not final in the sense that even if things begin to deteriorate next year were not going to think theres a high hurdle rate because after all we ended that program  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you i guess i would note that we are proposing to retain the last sentence i realize that if you repeat a sentence too many times it begins to lose meaning 
mr tarullo that is exactly my idea of it  people look at the deltas i think 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  first i just want to talk to some points that president plosser raised about inflation expectations  i completely agree that inflation expectations matter i think we have to be careful though that our concern about inflation expectations does not imply to others that well be forced to take back accommodation sooner on the inflation expectations front we can actually make considerable progress by explaining to people clearly why we can exit i thought it was interesting that everyone here has stipulated that we can exit but i dont think that the market believes that everybody on this committee believes that we can exit  i think it would be helpful to the markets if we did explain that and that would help keep inflation expectations more anchored  i also think that we could help keep inflation expectations better anchored by explaining that we think inflation will be subdued given the large output gap we can actually accomplish both goalsexplain our policy a little better and work at keeping inflation expectations anchored  so i think communication is something that we need to continue to work on  weve made quite a bit of progress this summeryour speech and testimony mr chairman on the exit strategy helped  but i think the more people who are confident that we can manage our exit the more helpful it will be on the inflation expectations front 
yesterday i was hoping to talk about largescale asset purchases  laughter now as next to the last speaker i think im going to be very repetitive but i do think its important to commit to do the entire 1 trillion and a lot of people already touched on the reasons  governor kohn talked about the fact that the trajectory of the unemployment rate is still unsatisfactory and i completely agree its less unsatisfactory than it was before but its still very unsatisfactory so taking back any sort of accommodation that is discretionary to us at this meeting seems inappropriate  in terms of the specific reasons that i was going to give yesterday the first is that this is whats expected  if we dont do what the market expects in this case it would lead to an inadvertent tightening of financial conditions and not just directly in terms of the effects on agency mbs yields because of the potential lack of additional purchases but also because it would be a new signal that were closer to exit in a broader sense  remember if you compare where the market is in terms of the timing of raising the federal funds rate and where the greenbook is theres a pretty big gap so for the market to be surprised were going to have to move faster than the market expects  it seems to be a pretty strong presumption that were probably going to go slower than the market expects 
second we are pretty far along in this program so this idea of not completing it gets difficult if you also want to do tapering that lasts through the end of the first quarter  by the end of this week we will have purchased what 895 billion roughly that leaves 355 billion with twentyseven weeks until the end of the first quarter  that means weve been purchasing at 25 billion a week roughly up to now  if we decided to do the whole amount were still cutting the rate of purchases roughly in half over the next six months  if you imagine that we cut the purchases to 20 billion a week between now and the next meeting wed only have about 235 billion left at the next meeting and then wed have to say  well do we really want to have the taper be so dramatic that we cannot actually do the whole program  i just think that we have to recognize that were so far along in this program that its extraordinarily likely that were going to want to complete it  in that case i dont really see the benefit of retaining this very small degree of optionality relative to the high probability that were actually going to go through with this program 
last this is a new point surprisingly although brian did raise it in his comments yesterday when we did implement the tapering language for the treasury purchase program we also committed to do the entire 300 billion at the same time  so there is a risk and i dont know how big a risk it isprobably a slight riskthat if we dont take the up to language out the market may note the difference  we committed to the entire amount when we did tapering with the treasury purchase program and in this case wed be committed to tapering but wed keep the up to language in i think that will create unnecessary ambiguity that will create some risk so obviously im in favor of taking the up to language out  in terms of the other language i have some sympathy with this idea of being a little bit more vague but my problem with that is how does the desk then know what to do  i think theres a bit of a tension there  i dont think theres that big a problem bringing back the purchase programs  if the economy behaves in a really bad way i think the market would probably expect it  i think if we say by the end of the first quarter that doesnt really rule out bringing it back if things go adversely 
on the question of wide range i agree with governor kohn  i think all available tools is the broadest phrase wide is less broad  range is less broad than that  i think it makes sense for us to err on that intermediate step and maybe we can go to a range of tools two or three meetings from now 
chairman bernanke okay thank you president plosser 
mr plosser mr chairman before you do your summary id like to put something back on the table that really hasnt been addressed as much as i think it needs to be  i raised it yesterday and president lacker raised it today and thats this issue of the sfp program and the importance it plays in fact it will be adding more stimulus to our balance sheet and more reserves to the economy  the treasury has the authority to make this decision at the end of the day and if this committee is consciously choosing not to sterilize that and therefore increase stimulus then we need to acknowledge that we are choosing to do that rather than accepting it passively its not clear whether the discussion about the increase in stimulus around this table and the options for providing it have been under the premise that the sfp is going to be there  as you suggested yesterday when you alluded to this and talked about it briefly it is important that this committee make an active decision to accept that additional stimulus if thats what the committee so chooses or to reject it and sterilize it  but i would not like that to be just sort of skipped over and accepted without a conscious discussion about how we think that fits into our broader strategy thats my issue mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you well let me try to summarize  first on the substance weve all agreed that the intermeeting data were more favorablethats a great relief and i think to some extent it validates the approach we took back in march  if we had known in march where wed be today i think we would be reasonably relieved about it  so i think thats all encouraging that being said as i mentioned in my goround comments on the outlook the economy does remain quite weak certainly quite far from meeting our maximum employment objective and there are costs on the downsideand im not talking about an insurance argument here im talking about the neutralrisk size of the costs  i think the downside risks are still dangerous because on the downside lies the possibility of renewed financial crisis and of course the marginal cost of higher unemploymentor less employmentis greater when youre starting from such an adverse position so i dont think that scaling back stimulus significantly at this meeting is warranted
  having said that i see it as a nuanced situation  i think its not right to say that we are going full bore and not in the process of exiting  we have both actively and passively allowed the rundown of substantial amounts of our liquidity programs and my own assumption is that as the early 2010 deadline comes around we will in fact close many if not most of those programs  second we have ended the treasury program  so i think its clearweve talked a good bit about exitto the markets and the public that we are in a mode now of thinking about the exit and have taken some concrete steps in that direction 
a second point thats come up which i think is an interesting one is to put it most bluntly the question of whether completing the 1 billion of mbs purchases is a further easing or a staying in place  because ive been focused on the asset side and on the effects on interest rates i guess i would conclude that its closer to staying in place than it is to a further easing first mortgage rates have been fairly constant throughout this entire program and i think that what well be seeing when we stop the program is probably some backup in mortgage rates so that measure of ease has been constant over the period of the program  in fact whether you believe in a stock effect or a flow effect either one would suggest that if you were to cut back your planned purchases it would cause rates to rise and it would be a tightening relative to expectations 
now the quantitative easing theory is a little bit more ambiguous  if were putting more reserves into the system then arguably that is a further easing  but i have two observations  one is that those effects may be small and the other is as governor duke mentioned that its uncertain to what extent the effects of that are anticipated in the markets already  so its a complicated question  my own feeling is that if we were to adopt something like alternative c and actively cut back on our plan today not only would it be tightening in the sense of pulling back on the assetpurchase program but it also would send a very strong signal that we were very close to exit and i still dont think were there yet  so i do think that our options really are to continue with the program and one of the key decisions that we have is exactly how to describe how were going to go forward with the program at this point 
now theres the other side of the question that president yellen and governor tarullo and others mentioned  if were unsatisfied with the situation and we think the federal funds rate ought to be minus 4 percent why arent we doing even more here again i dont think we should rule that out but i feel some sympathy to what president evans said which is that given all the uncertainties we have and the issues about our balance sheet and exit and our uncertainties about the effects of these programs its not obvious that we do have a lot of ammunition left even on this unconventional dimension  having said that i think we should obviously keep this possibility alive if the situation warrants it but its not clear to me at this point we should be doing more either  so i do support the language in alternative b but there are a couple of decisions that we need to make 
to get to the most substantive one first im not sure governor tarullo if i got your vote on the up to language but excluding your vote i think i have five for keeping up to six for dropping it and four who were split evenly between slightly favored one or the other did you have a preference 
mr tarullo yes i think it depends for me ultimately mr chairman on what other language might change  were you to tell me that no other language was going to change and i get to do up to or not i would want it out 
chairman bernanke okay im happy to take another straw vote but personally i lean slightly towards taking it out on the grounds of market certainty and on the argument that the vice chairman made namely that by november we will in any case be already up to 1 trillion and we wont have a lot of flexibility to fall short  but frankly im with president lockharti think its a pretty close call and i dont think it necessarily is a firstorder issue but we do need to resolve it so if its okay i think id like to take a straw vote of the full committee including all participants  president plosser is that okay with you 
mr plosser thats okay but there are two elements to this 
chairman bernanke okay 
mr plosser one is the up to and the other is how long we extend it for  so im trying to figure out whether we want to treat those separately 
chairman bernanke all right 
mr plosser for some of us that might be dependent 
chairman bernanke okay so i think if we keep up to again and we taper i think we ought to have an end date at a minimum  if we take away the end date then theres just too much uncertainty involved  so lets talk for a moment about the end date  brian how strong is the preference of the desk for the first quarter  what arguments can you make about first quarter versus what i think are the two other options weve heard one is end of second quarter and the other is in the second quarter the difference being i guess that the end of second quarter theoretically could encompass a much earlier decline 
mr sack i think even using the end of first quarter provides a sixmonth tapering period which is actually pretty long  the concerns i raised in the briefing were that a longer tapering period certainly will require a much steeper dropoff in the pace of purchases in the near term  as policymakers the risk to be taken into consideration is whether that will actually prompt a quicker backup in mortgage rates 
my main point was that from a market functioning perspective i thought q1 is a sufficient tapering period so i wouldnt use market functioning as an argument for going all the way to q2 i think that decision would have to be based instead on market effects and policy flexibility and things that fall in your domain not mine 
chairman bernanke i have the following proposed compromise on that  president yellen correctly made an interesting suggestion of replacing completed with executed and the reason that matters is that unlike treasuries mbs take weeks to clear so if we execute by the end of the first quarter that means the balance sheet effects will probably go into the second quarter  is that going to be okay  all right so lets take that as given if we will that were going to execute these things by the end of the first quarter  then conditional on that can i have a straw vote on whether to keep up to  those in favor of keeping up to please raise your hand i see one two three four five those in favor of dropping up to one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  the preference is to drop up to  that has the advantage of being parallel to the treasury language and creating some more certainty 
that all being said i think its always clear that we have flexibility  we have a last sentence here that says well be reviewing the timing and purchase of securities so i dont think we have abandoned flexibility i for one certainly would be open to adjusting the program if we do see significant changes in the outlook in the next few weeks 
yes president lacker 
mr lacker taking out up to is a firm commitment to the program  if we were to see some problems in banking markets caused by the expansion of reserves would we consider running off treasuries or selling treasuries in order to drain reserves  is that an element of flexibility that remains on the table 
chairman bernanke actually thats a good question and i was going to respond to president plossers point 
mr lacker its related to this question as well 
chairman bernanke yes so i think there are a couple of things going on there  first its my expectation that the sfp program will come back after the debt ceiling issue is resolved although of course as i said we shouldnt count on that definitively  second these programsthe reverse repos the term deposits these tools that we want to have in placei think we ought to put them into operation on some small scale early that is if possible by the end of the year or early next year just so that we can be assured that they work and the market can see that they work so i would encourage staff to keep that goal in mind  i think that would give us certainly an additional wayand this actually corresponds to about the time that the sfp is going to run down around the end of the yearto finetune if reserves were becoming a concern of course we could always sell treasuries  
mr plosser excuse me 
chairman bernanke yes president plosser 
mr plosser im just trying to make sure i understand  does that mean that your view would be that in the absence of the return of the sfp program we would actually use these tools to offset in effect that increase in stimulus or increase in reserves thats happening is that what im hearing you say or is it something different 
chairman bernanke what im saying is that in any event we ought to start these programs on a small scale to assure ourselves that they work  if the sfp program doesnt come back then i agree that as you said we ought to actively decide about how much reserves we want in the system 
i think president lacker raised the possibility that the high level of reserves was actually causing some kind of dysfunction or problem  ill tell you my bias  185 billion in reserves from a macro stimulus point of view is not that big a deal  it might be a bigger deal in terms of market function or banking function  in that case there would be a good reason to explain to the markets why were doing this operation without necessarily changing the overall intent or the thrust of our policy so yes we then could use one of several methods if the committee decided to offset some of that 
mr plosser i guess im being difficult but im worried about the perception of the marketplace namely that we are passively accepting an increase of 185 billion of reserves without an active decision by this committee to do so  if we do anticipate that sfp comes back in some ways that eases our exit strategies and i understand why that may in fact be desirable  but given the political interaction between debt ceilings and other things do we want it to go away or do we want it to come back  those are knotty little questions about how then we manage these extra reserves in terms of this committees view of policy going forward 
chairman bernanke well have the tools to manage it  as for market expectations because of our communication for better or worse i think expectations are mostly formed around the size of the purchase programs and not the size of the reserves in the banking system  because theres no way to keep the purchase programs and reduce the reserves were effectively locked into that 
there were a couple of other things that i might as well ask about  there was the question of wide range versus not having wide range and i guess the argument is its somewhat less jarring to go to a wide range but again i dont think this is a firstorder issue would anyone like to comment on that before i ask for a straw vote  president lockhart 
mr lockhart i thought vice chairman dudley laid it out well and i hadnt thought of it so cleanly but there are essentially three degrees of emphasis here  one is the old language i gather which would have been all available tools then wide range is sort of the middle ground and range is the weakest  is that the way you thought of it so were actually moving from all available tools to something else 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley  you raised it i mean is that how you thought of it 
mr kohn yes i thought that backing away from all available tools would be seen as a consequential step in that the committee as the chairman said was at least putting the exit strategy into place even though it wasnt executing it so i guess i have a mild preference for including wide 
chairman bernanke okay any other comments on wide 
mr lacker well theres narrow range and wide is in between narrow and laughter 
mr plosser or we could say broad range which is in between 
chairman bernanke all right  laughter  im putting an end to this  let me ask how many are in favor of putting in wide one two three four five six seven eight nine ten just for the record how many are against it  one two three okay so lets include wide i think those are the major decisions 
i will comment on the first paragraph  we had some views on both sides that is whether it was too cheery or not cheery enough whether it was certain enough or uncertain enough  im at a little bit of a loss as to where to go with it  i felt the comments were pretty balanced around where we were but if anyone else would like to address that  would you like to address that governor tarullo 
mr tarullo yes but i dont get the sense that anybody else has any appetite for it so i dont want to take peoples time up  after although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time i would have inserted and there remains considerable uncertainty as to future economic performance the committee anticipates that 
chairman bernanke yes i understand i think the likely to remain weak probably conveys a lot of your uncertainty 
mr tarullo its the same point i think that you made before which is that there is language which has been in there for a while but now we have cheered up the rest of the paragraph just as in paragraph 3 the language in the last sentence has been in there for a while but weve firmed up the rest of the paragraph  thats why i was hoping for at least mildly offsetting phraseology changes 
chairman bernanke president plosser 
mr plosser i would just comment that we do have this phrase that household spending will be constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit so we have some caveats in there about weaknesses that are inherent in the economy already in this paragraph 
chairman bernanke if we wanted to finetune one other suggestionand i promise this is the last thingin the sentence beginning businesses are still cutting back there is the part about slower pace  we could go back to the august language which says businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but they are continuing to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  so it would be the same sentence as last time and we would eliminate one element of cheeriness from the description is there any interest in that 
mr tarullo even im not interested in that 
chairman bernanke all right i think we i hope have executed effective directive wording 
mr madigan mr chairman i have some suggested wording for that 
chairman bernanke okay 
mr madigan but before we get to that could i ask about paragraph 2 
chairman bernanke sure 
mr madigan are we taking that as it is here or not 
chairman bernanke we could reverse the order  the way its written president plosser its intended to say that these are both necessary conditions that theyre both part of the model one version we had earlier started off by saying longerterm inflation expectations are stable and substantial resource slack is likely to continue dampening cost pressures  therefore the committee     i dont think thats any better from your perspective 
mr plosser no for my purposes i was trying to get some more conditionality into it 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr plosser the degree to which slack will damp pressures is conditional on these anchored expectations and thats the message i was trying to instill by reversing the order 
chairman bernanke what weve done of course is added inflationary expectations to the description 
mr plosser i acknowledged that was a step forward  i thought that was great 
chairman bernanke anything else   all right brian would you like to read the statement 
mr madigan mr chairman perhaps i could refer everybody to page 3 of my briefing materials and make sure that everybody agrees on whats being changed  no change to paragraph 1 no change to paragraph 2 in paragraph 3  inclusion of the word wide several lines down deletion of the phrase up to a few more lines down substitution of the word executed for completed just before the bracket and inclusion of the phrase by the end of the first quarter no other changes i believe to the statement 
mr evans can i ask just one question 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans by using the word execute in the same sentence were going to refer to executed for the mbs but completed for treasuries  any 
chairman bernanke i think the market people will figure out the difference right 
vice chairman dudley because its settlement issues 
chairman bernanke were using the language thats technically correct  brian is that right do you have any problem with this 
mr sack no i dont have a problem  i dont think its a massive source of confusion if it says completed but i have no problem with executed either 
chairman bernanke all right 
mr madigan mr chairman on the directive 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr madigan im on page 8 of my handout directive 4 alternative b  to reflect the use of the word execute in the statement in the middle of the paragraph id suggest that we break the sentence beginning the desk is expected into two sentences so that the first sentence would end at after the end of october  that is the desk is expected to complete purchases of about 300 billion of longerterm treasury securities by the end of october period  it is also expected to execute purchases of up to 200 billion in housingrelated agency debt and about 125 trillion of agency mbs by the end of the first quarter  that applies execute to both debt and mbs but i dont think thats a problem 
chairman bernanke okay and let me just remind everybody that were retaining up to for the agency debt i think the sense of the committee brian is that well continue to slow that down we may well not want to go to the full amount of that category 
all right any other comments matt can you call the roll 
mr luecke yes this vote will encompass alternative b with the changes described by brian madigan as well as directive b also with the changes described by brian madigan chairman bernanke  yes vice chairman dudley  yes governor duke yes president evans yes governor kohn yes president lacker yes president lockhart yes governor tarullo yes governor warsh yes president yellen  yes 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  matt do you know if the lunch is ready at 1230 
mr luecke the lunch is ready now 
chairman bernanke we will be heading up to lunch for our colleague gary stern as i said yesterday in december well have a presentation on inflation dynamics  our next meeting is november 3 and 4  with nothing else the meeting is adjourned 
end of meeting
