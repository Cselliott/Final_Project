transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of
august 5 2008
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  today is the last meeting for
our colleague governor mishkin  rick has attended 16 fomc meetings as a committee
member and 23 additional meetings i assume mostly as the research director for new york  we
are certainly going to miss your singular interventionslaughter as well as your insights and
your collegiality  there will be a lunch today in honor of rick and we will have a chance then
to express our appreciation for your time here and for your contributions
there are comings and goings  today is also the first meeting for governor duke whom
i was pleased to swear in about 15 minutes ago in my office  laughter  it took an
unconscionably long time for this qualified person to be confirmed by the us senate  we are
very glad that she had the patience to stick it out and that she is finally here  she brings a great
deal to the table including a lot of experience in banking which obviously is something of great
interest to us these days  so welcome  we look forward to a long and productive association
turning to desk operations before bill begins a couple of issues were raised in our last
videoconference  one had to do with the concern about whether we have a sufficient balance
sheet to address liquidity needs going forward  bill i believe you are going to talk a bit about
thatgive an interim report on where we are on balance sheet issues and what we might do in
case those constraints start to bind  the second concern that was raised had to do with what we
mean by unusual and exigent and how we determine whether those conditions are still
prevailing  i have asked brian and the staff to put together a memo giving us some thoughts on
that issue and that will come to you before the next meeting and give us a chance to think about
it and as time permits discuss it at the next meeting  without further ado bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  i am going to be referring to the handout in front of you  it seems to be getting thicker at every meeting  since the june fomc meeting financial markets have been characterized by two distinct phases  until the middle of july share prices weakened substantially and credit spreads widened  the financial sectors difficulties were at the forefront as housing price declines continued to pressure this sector  the indymac failure led to uninsured depositors taking losses and this roiled the regional banking sector  the equity prices of fannie mae and freddie mac plummeted and their ongoing viability was called into question  the passage of housing legislation that provided support to the gses then led to an improvement in investor sentiment and a modest recovery in share prices  as shown in exhibit 1 financial sector shares led the recovery
however the overall improvement in the broad market indexes was very modest both in the united states and abroad exhibit 2  moreover no meaningful improvement was evident in the corporate debt or cds markets  cds spreads have not changed much and spreads of assetbacked securities have begun to widen again exhibits 3 and 4
despite intermeeting news that i would characterize on balance as more bad than good this news did not trigger the type of riskreduction spasms by investors that have sporadically plagued financial markets over the past year  exhibits 5 and 6 compare the correlation of daily asset price changes across a broad array of asset classes in july to the corresponding period in march  the blue boxes denote correlations with absolute values of more than 05  as can be seen asset price movements have become much less correlated
although the mood is slightly improved today compared with a few weeks ago the underlying news especially from the financial sector remains quite bleak in most respects  in particular there is little conviction that financial shares have reached a bottom  this can be seen in the unusually high volatility of financial share prices exhibit 7 and the positive skew in options prices for financial firms in which the price of a put has been much higher than an equivalent outofthe money call exhibit 8  financial market participants are paying more to protect the downside than to participate on the upside
merrill lynchs recent experience is reflective of the challenging environment faced by financial firms  merrill lynch raised new equity capital and announced that it had sharply reduced its net abs cdo exposure  investors were initially pleased that the company had bitten the bullet and the share price rallied in response  but further consideration tempered the initial enthusiasmand there are more articles on this in the wall street journal today  a closer look revealed some troubling aspects of the transactions  first merrill lynch took an additional 44 billion of cdo write downs from the june quarterend valuation date  merrill lynch sold cdo exposures with a par value of 306 billion to lone star for 67 billion  at quarterend these positions had been carried on the books for 111 billion  second this transaction resulted in a drop in net cdo exposure of only 17 billion because merrill lynch

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
provided 75 percent nonrecourse financing to lone star  merrill lynch gave away all the upside on these assets in exchange for a payment equal to 6 percent of their par value  third merrill lynchs equity issuance reportedly resulted in 38 percent dilution to existing shareholders  the dilution was exacerbated by the terms of an earlier share issuance agreement with temasek a singapore sovereign wealth fund
this agreement granted temasek a make whole provision if within 12 months common stock was issued at a price below temaseks 48 per share investment  this resulted in merrill lynchs paying 25 billion to temasek which temasek then rolled into a new 34 billion share investment
over the past month the troubles of fannie mae and freddie mac have taken center stage  rising loan delinquencies for prime singlefamily mortgages caused share prices to plunge  this eroded confidence that the firms would be able to raise new equity capital and raised concerns about the viability of these firms  this in turn intensified the downward pressure on share prices  as a result investors began to lose their enthusiasm for the firms debt  investors in shortterm discount notes were uninterested in taking on any potential credit risk  as a result issuance volumes fell and discount note rates climbed exhibits 9 and 10  some investors in the firms longerterm debt obligationsincluding some major foreign central banksbecame unwilling to add to their longterm agency debt and agency mbs positions and one or two of the central banks actually cut their positions somewhat  however longer term debt spreads did not change much because the loss of central bank demand was offset by buying from us fixedincome asset managers who believed that the implicit treasury support of gse debt was likely to be hardened exhibit 11  fannie and freddie responded by issuing less debt  to husband their liquidity the two firms have backed away from purchasing agency mortgagebacked securities for their own portfolios  the removal of this bid was one factor that caused the mortgage basis the spreads between the optionadjusted yield on agency mbs and other benchmark yields such as treasuries and interest rate swapsto widen significantly exhibit 12
the congress responded by enacting housing legislation that included provisions that hardened the implicit government guarantee and thus reduced debt rollover risk the treasury now has authority to lend the gses an unlimited amount of funds the magnitude being constrained only by the debtlimit ceiling  in response discount note issuance costs have fallen in the most recent auctions  however enactment of the legislation has not generated any comparable narrowing in the mortgage basis or resolved the longerterm outlook for the gses  the mortgage basis remains wide in part because fannie mae and freddie mac have few incentives to expand their balance sheets  although their regulatory capital is still well above minimum levels these capital standards are under review  moreover because further losses are likely in coming quarters it is unclear how long this excess capital will be available to support portfolio growth  of course the two firms could respond by issuing new equity  however the low level of these companies share prices makes this option unattractive  to raise sufficient funds to ensure longterm viability would cause massive dilution for existing shareholders  to put this in perspective the current market capitalization of freddie mac is only about 5 billion  this compares with a
book of business in terms of its portfolio and guaranteed book of 22 trillion because the gses will likely remain reluctant to expand their balance sheets in the near term the mortgage basis will probably remain elevated keeping mortgage rates high  this will intensify the downward pressure on housing activity and prices which in turn will lead to greater loan delinquencies and losses  the consequence will likely put further pressure on fannies and freddies capital positions  so whats the bottom line  in my view the legislation has helped to avertat least for nowa meltdown in the agency debt and agency mbs markets  but the passage is no panacea for ensuring the viability of fannie mae and freddie mac or in enabling the two firms to provide significant support to the us housing market
one consequence of the gserelated turbulence was a temporary pickup in demand in the most recent schedule 1 tslf auction on july 25 exhibit 13  as term mortgage agency repo spreads widened relative to term treasury repo rates the cost of borrowing via the tslf became more attractive  this illustrates how the tslf program can act as a shock absorber and reduce volatility in term repo rates  with the exception of the july 25 auction the tslf auctions continue to be undersubscribed with relatively stable bidtocover ratios
in contrast to the turbulence evident in the financial sector the bank term funding markets have been relatively stable since the june fomc meeting  as shown in exhibits 14 and 15 the spreads of onemonth libor and threemonth libor to ois remain elevated in the united states europe and the united kingdom  however this masks the fact that forward funding rates appear to have risen significantly  as shown in exhibit 16 the forward threemonth liborois spread has risen about
20 basis points over the past three months  this spread is now anticipated to remain elevated at around 50 basis points on a onetotwoyear time horizon indicating that market participants expect term funding pressures to persist for the foreseeable future before the crisis the spread was about 10 basis points
the us taf auctions also show a stable trend  as shown in exhibit 17 the bid tocover ratio remains around 12 to 1 and the stopout rate has been quite steady over the past five auctions  in contrast as shown in exhibit 18 the bidtocover ratio for the ecb dollar auction continues to climb  as i noted in an earlier briefing part of this rise reflects the fact that the ecb auction is noncompetitive  the bids are prorated and the banks pay the us stopout rate  larger bids by european banks in the ecb auction do not affect the interest rate they pay for such funding and that encourages moreaggressive bidding  conversations with the ecb staff indicate that they are concerned that the outcome could be a bidding spiral  individual banks could keep raising the size of their bid submissions to ensure a stable amount of dollar funding  it is possible that these pressures could eventually encourage the ecb to switch to a swiss national bank type of multipleprice auction  this would eliminate the incentives to bid more and more aggressively on the part of the european banks  however such a change probably would result in a higher stopout rate in the ecb auctions compared with the united states or switzerland  ecb officials might not be fully comfortable with such an outcome
early reactions by primary dealers and depository institutions to the two refinements to our liquidity facilitiesthe 50 billion program of options on the tslf and the introduction of the longer 84day maturity taf auctionshave been favorable  we recentlylast friday and this mondaycompleted an extensive set of interviews with the primary dealer community about the tslf options program and will be proposing final terms within the set of parameters approved by the fomc on july 24 by the end of this week  of course we will keep you fully apprised as we go forward on this
as you know our liquidity facilities have placed significant demands on the federal reserves balance sheet as the chairman mentioned  as the liquidity facilities have been expanded we have reduced the size of our treasury portfolio  we do this to drain the reserves added by our liquidity programs  the use of our balance sheet to sterilize these reserve additions has raised questions about whether sufficient capacity is still available to meet prospective demandespecially a large unanticipated rise in pdcf or pcf borrowing  exhibit 19 illustrates the transformation of the federal reserve systems balance sheet over the past year out of treasuries into nontreasury lending  as shown in exhibit 20 the nontreasury portion consists mainly of 150 billion of taf loans the 62 billion in steady state of foreign exchange swaps executed with the ecb and the snb and our 80 billion 28day maturity singletranche repo program  although the amount of treasuries held in the soma portfolio still totals 479 billion a majority of these securities are encumbered in one way or another  as shown in exhibit 21 from that 479 billion we need to allocate 45 billion of treasuries to collateralize the foreign central bank repo pool retain 35 billion of ontherun treasury securities to keep available for our traditional treasury securities lending program and set aside 175 billion for the tslf program and now an additional 50 billion for the tslf options program top  when the options program is included we have about 174 billion of unencumbered treasuries available to offset additional pcf and pdcf borrowing or to fund further expansion of our liquidity programs  obviously further expansion of our taf or tslf auctions or singletranche repo operations would be at our discretion and thus does not pose a meaningful problem in terms of reserve management  we wouldnt expand these programs if we didnt have the ability to conduct offsetting reserve draining operations  however what would we do if faced with a huge rise in pcf or pdcf borrowing  an inability to drain the reserves added by such lending would cause the federal funds rate to collapse below the target
fortunately we have a number of alternatives that would enable us to offset very large demands for pcf or pdcf borrowing  first we could sell our remaining unencumbered treasury holdings or use them to engage in reverse repo operations with the primary dealer community  this could be augmented by the 35 billion of ontherun treasury securities currently set aside for securities lending  together these two sources could be used to drain more than 200 billion of reserves  second we have made arrangements with the treasury so that if the need arises the treasury would issue special treasury bills into the market on our behalf and take the proceeds
and deposit them at the federal reserve  putting the proceeds of such tbill sales on the feds balance sheet would drain reserves from the banking system  the potential scope here is large  the housing legislation raised the debt limit substantially  there is now about 12 trillion of headroom under the debt limit compared with only about
400 billion previously  third we continue to press for legislation that would accelerate the timing of the federal reserves authority to pay interest on reserves being able to pay interest on reserves would put a floor under the federal funds rate in this case an inability to drain additional reserves from the banking system would not result in the federal funds rate collapsing toward zero  finally we continue to explore the legal and operational feasibility of expanding our balance sheet in other ways  for example could we engage in reverse repurchase transactions using the collateral obtained from our singletranche repo and from our tslf operations
i wouldnt say i am confident that we can handle any eventualityafter all the triparty repo system provides trillions of dollars of funding to the primary dealers  in the unlikely event that it all came to us we wouldnt have the capacity to fully offset it at present  but we could accommodate hundreds of billions of dollars of demand if that proved to be necessary  that said i want to go on record that any very large unanticipated demand for funding from the federal reserve by dealers or depository institutions might take a few days or more to offset by reservedraining operations
thus in such a circumstance the federal funds rate could temporarily trade below its target
turning now to interest rate expectations monetary policy expectations have reverted back to the very slow path toward tightening that was evident before the april fomc meeting  as shown in exhibits 22 and 23 the federal funds rate and eurodollar futures curves have shifted down sharply since the june fomc meeting our current survey of the primary dealers shows an even slower anticipated pace of tightening  as shown in exhibit 24 the average of the dealer forecasts in our most recent survey anticipates no tightening until the second quarter of 2009  but the change in the dealers forecasts since the june fomc meeting is more modest than the shift in market expectations compare exhibits 24 and 25  looking at the probabilities of different rate outcomes implied by options on federal funds rate futures in exhibits 26 and 27 one sees that there has been a steady trend upward in the probability that the fomc will keep its policy target rate unchanged at both the august and the september fomc meetings  note also that the probability assigned by market participants to further easing is lower than the probability assigned to tightening
the past month has been marked by a significant decline in commodity prices
as shown in exhibit 28 although the energy complex has led the way down agriculture and industrial metals prices have also declined significantly  these declines have spurred a large decline in breakeven rates of inflation measured by the spread of nominal treasury and tips yields exhibit 29  as shown in exhibit 30 longerterm marketbased indicators of inflation expectations have increased a bit
both the barclays and the board staffs measures of fiveyear fiveyearforward
inflation implied by nominal treasury versus tips yields have drifted upward since the june fomc meeting  however both measures remain well below the peaks reached in early march
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the june fomc meeting  as always i am very happy to take any questions
chairman bernanke  thank you very much bill  any questions for bill
president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  bill at our recent intermeeting call i wasnt
expecting the characterization of the financial stresses to sort of backtrack to the point that it
feels like march  maybe somebody said it was as scary as march  i have noticed in a lot of our
speeches that many have noted that financial conditions have not returned to normal and i have
always kind of wondered what normal would be  with hundreds of billions of dollars of losses
at major financial institutions i guess i am wondering whether we can reasonably expect that
this distress and adjustment will be alleviated over some reasonably short period of time  we are
12 months in  isnt this likely to take 12 more months or longer  financial institutions have a
lot to digest  what do you think financial institutions and markets have to do to signal a return to
acceptable functionality  what are we looking for and what changes in fundamentals are likely
to occur that would deliver sustainable liquidity improvements
mr dudley  okay  that is a big question  laughter
mr evans  i think this is a good time to revisit our strategy and what we are thinking
about accomplishing here  it is my understanding that the chairman has asked you to look at
unusual and exigent circumstances
mr dudley  i think the first thing we can say is that market participants expect this
to last a long time  the fact that the forward liborois spreads are elevated looking out a
year or two years suggests that the market views the balance sheet adjustment process as taking
quite a long time  second i would say that how long is really going to depend in part on how
the macroeconomy evolves  if the macroeconomy evolves in a favorable way then the losses
that will be borne by the financial sector will be discretely smaller and so you can get through
this process sooner  in contrast if the economy has a bad macroeconomic outcome then
obviously this is going to be a lot worse  we dont really know the answer to that yet  part of
that is also going to be very sensitive to what happens in terms of individual institutions over the
next 6 to 12 months because we are putting a tremendous amount of strain on the financial
sector  if there is little breakage then the chance of our getting through relatively quickly say in
12 months is pretty high  but if that stress creates failures and systemic contagion because of
those failures then this could last quite a long time  so the answer is that we dont really know
yet  i think there is a long way to go  we are about one year in by my measure  i date this back
to august 9 when the ecb did their massive reserve intervention  so i wouldnt want to make a
bet on what inning this is but it is definitely not the ninth inning
mr fisher  please no baseball analogies  laughter
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i want to follow up on that a little because it
seems to me that over a year ago now there was a lot of discussion by various parties that had to
do with risk premiums being very low  people were worried that the economy and the financial
markets were underpricing risk  now all of a sudden these spreads have increased  if you look
at the ois spread that you referred to the onetotwo years out is there a possibility that this is
permanentthat in some sense the level of spreads in the pricing of the risk is just now higher
and it is going to stay higher maybe not as high as the peak but at some higher level  if that is
true then using those spreads as a measure of how distressed the market is could be very
misleading  as a consequence it would seem as though you would want to be asking questions
not just about the prices and the spreads but also about volumes in these markets  maybe bill
you can elaborate on what volumes are doingcertainly in the nearterm the overnight and the
onemonth interbank funding markets  are volumes back to their levels even though the spreads
are higher  i think we have to be a little careful that if this really is a permanent shift in risk
premiums looking at these things may be the wrong metric for assessing what is going on  if
you have any observations about that i would like to hear them
mr dudley  i think it is a fair point that we shouldnt assume that normal is
returning to the liborois spreads that applied before august 2007 so we have to look at a
broader set of indicators  for example i think that it would be worthwhile looking at the spread
between jumbo mortgage rates and conforming mortgage rates as evidence of the degree of the
shadow price of balance sheet capacity  i think that once financial institutions either raise
sufficient capital or stop taking loanloss provisions or writing down assets so that they have
enough capacity to expand their balance sheets we will be getting to the end of this process
another thing i would say to add to the answer i gave earlier to president evans is that
the trajectory of housing in all of this is going to be hugely important  one thing that may signal
the next phase maybe the beginning of the end is when people really do get a sign that the
housing sector is starting to bottom probably first in activity and then in price  once that
happens the huge risk premium embedded in some of these mortgagerelated assets will then
collapse  that means that the marktomarket losses in a lot of institutions will start to fall  so i
think that is going to be a very very important metric once housing starts to really bottom and
people get some visibility about how much home prices will go down  you know when the
argument is about whether home prices are going to go down 15 percent or 20 percent that will
be a very different argument from the argument now which is whether home prices are going to
go down 15 percent or 30 percent
mr plosser  how about volumes
mr dudley  i think that the market function has varied frankly  in the middle of the
gse turmoil the agency market was basically shut down  with the passage of the legislation it
has improved  haircuts are still quite elevated  liquidity is certainly not as good as it was back
before this crisis  the cost of funding through the fx swap market is still very elevated relative
to libor  i think things are improving though in the sense that shocks are not as broadly
contagious as they were before  the reason is that people now are pretty cognizant of what the
problems are and so when there are new bad pieces of information people arent quite as
shocked and they dont revise their outlook to the same degree about a whole variety of asset
classes  but i think that is why the correlation slide that i showed you in the exhibits showed
less of a correlation between different asset classes  we are still getting tremendous amounts of
movement in asset prices but it doesnt seem as though if something happens in one sector it
necessarily ripples through to other sectors
chairman bernanke  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  im just following up here  i mean as
much as i love exhibits 14 15 and 16and i have used a lot of them myself when i talk about
the economyit is not really appropriate to look at these as measures of stress  you could just
say that these are the equilibrium prices in an economy that is adjusting to a big shock  you
could have a completely flat line here that would indicate stress in markets because these prices
arent moving around appropriately to the risks that have developed and opened up  so a lot of
the concern around the table has been exactly that when markets freeze up you cant do any
trade at any price and for that the volume data would seem to be a much better indicator of the
kinds of things that we are worried about  i think that this is conditioning a lot of our thinking
about the economyyou look at this picture and you naturally think it has to go back to 10 basis
points before the crisis is over  that probably is not going to happen anytime soon and maybe
never  thanks
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i thought that part of president evanss question was whether markets
are back to normal for a period in which they are adjusting to hundreds of billions of dollars of
losses on mortgage loans  so i would be interested in your characterization of how markets are
working relative to how well they ought to work in that circumstance
mr dudley  i guess we dont have a lot of observations to know what normal is in
that environment  i think that the markets are generally doing somewhat better as i said relative
to the flow of new information  i dont think the information flow has improved but i think the
markets are responding a little better to the bad information  that is how i would characterize it
mr lacker  if i could follow up the reactions you described sound warranted by the
information coming in  the market is digesting information about the location and magnitude of
losses and the extent to which housing is going to recover
mr dudley  i think the market is reacting pretty appropriately to the information it is
seeing although i would say that the risk premiums are still high in a pretty broad array of assets
relative to what one would think would be normal  haircuts are high and market liquidity is still
impaired  we are definitely not back to normal market function in a pretty broad array of asset
classes
mr lacker  but when you use normal in that sentence you mean a time period
without hundreds of millions of dollars of losses that we dont know quite the magnitude of
right
mr dudley  yes  it is hard to benchmark how markets are supposed to behave in a
period with hundreds of billions of dollars of lossesbecause how many times have we actually
gone through this experience
mr lacker  so if i could just follow upin these graphs what would you point to as
the effects of our actions or our lending
mr dudley  the effects of our actions have been to mitigate the rise in term funding
pressures and to somewhat mitigate the forced liquidation of collateral because of the inability to
obtain funding  because of that our actions have helped prevent the kind of pernicious margin
spiral that we saw in march when volatility was going up and haircuts were going up which
was then causing marktomarket losses which were causing forced selling  so i think our
actions have mitigated those to some degree  now obviously we dont know what the
counterfactual would have been in the absence of our actions but i believeand most market
participants believethat our actions have been helpful in those respects
chairman bernanke  thank you  i guess i would comment that there is an
asymmetry here which is the possibility of systemic risk  there are situations in which
failuresmajor collapses of certain marketscan have discontinuous and large effects on the
economy  we have seen that in many contexts across a large number of countries  these
stresses do reflect the working out of equilibriums given fundamental losses which we cant do
very much or anything about  but they do create machinery that is less flexible and less able to
respond to new shocks and that raises systemic risk  that is the risk that we want to try to
minimize even as we allow the markets to work their way through and to price the changes we
have seen
mr dudley  we have never argued that the role of our facilities is to prevent the
adjustment  we have always argued that the role of the facilities is to allow the adjustment to be
orderly rather than disorderly  that is what we have been going for
mr lacker  i would be interested in seeing a model mr chairman  thank you
chairman bernanke  certainly  any other questions for bill  if not let me turn
to david wilcox for the economic situation
mr wilcox  thank you mr chairman  in putting together the economic outlook for the current greenbook we confronted three main changes in circumstances relative to the situation as it stood in june  first the labor market looked distinctly weaker than we had anticipated  in the employment report that was released in early july payroll employment declined by more in june than we had been expecting and the unemployment rate held at 5 percent rather than dropping back as we had anticipated following the increase of 05 percentage point in the previous month  the fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons had moved up sharply and claims for unemployment insurance were trending up  the second major change in circumstance that we confronted was a second quarter increase in real gdp that apparently continued to outpace our expectations
in last wednesdays greenbook we projected growth at an annual rate of 27 percent in the second quarter 1 percentage point stronger than in the june greenbook  at that pace gdp growth would have slightly exceeded our estimate of the rate of growth of potential output  the third major change was a financial sector that looked more hostile to economic activity on balance than at the time of the last meeting despite the improvement during the second half of the intermeeting period that bill dudley has just described  when we put the greenbook to bed the stock market was about 7 percent lower than we had expected as of june a variety of spreads remained wide or had widened further since the previous greenbook and concerns had been heightened about some key institutions  in addition the latest reading from the senior loan officer opinion survey pointed to a remarkably widespread continued tightening of terms and standards for both households and businesses
these three factorsa weaker labor market apparently stronger aggregate demand and a more hostile financial environmentdid not easily fit together  to
resolve the situation we began by ruling in favor of the profile presented by the labor market and heavily discounting the greater vigor being signaled by the spending indicators  in our judgment the story being told by the labor market seemed by far the more credible one what with housing prices continuing to decline at a rapid pace consumer sentiment dropping into subbasement levels energy prices remaining high even after their recent partial reversal loan officers reporting a pervasive tightening of credit terms and standards and other measures of financial stress flashing at least amber  moreover while quartertoquarter discrepancies between gdp and ip are commonplace the nearly 4 percent drop in manufacturing ip during the second quarter fueled our skepticism that the economy was on a fundamentally sound footing
as you know for several greenbooks our gdp projection has been substantially weaker than it would have been if we had kept in line with the advice from our forecasting models  we were motivated to impose this judgmental weakness partly in recognition of the possibility that we might be entering a recession and recessions are times when spending tends to fall short of the level that would be indicated by the fundamentals  we also were motivated by the restraint that we think financial markets are imposing on real activity and which our models are illequipped to capture  in the current projection we had to modify these assumptions in light of the changed circumstances  in effect we interpreted the greaterthanexpected strength of real gdp during the second quarter as reflecting an error of timing with respect to the judgmental weakness that we had built into the forecast but not a misjudgment about the overall magnitude of that weakness
implementing that interpretation involved three steps  first we responded to the unexpected strength in firsthalf gdp growth by shifting some judgmental weakness into the second half  second we deepened the overall amount of restraint that we imposed in light of the less favorable financial climate  third we stretched out the period of financial recuperation  whereas previously we had financial market conditions essentially returning to normal by the middle of next year in this projection we have the period of recuperation extending into 2010  these adjustments left our projection for real gdp growth 01 percentage point lower over the second half of this year and 02 lower next year despite the offsets from lower oil prices and a slightly greater dose of fiscal stimulus reflecting the introduction of extended unemployment insurance benefits
for the most part the avalanche of information that we received since putting out the greenbook last wednesday has corroborated our projection  this years revision of the national income and product accounts threw us no real curve balls  sorry for the baseball analogy  laughter  the growth of real gdp was revised down by an average of 02 percentage point per year  the revisions to the pce price indexes both core and total were very slight  while the bea has given us some homework to do between now and the september meeting in folding these data into our thinking any adjustments that we might be prompted to make including to the supply side of our forecast are likely to be slight
on the face of it the advance estimate of real gdp growth in the second quarter of this year seemed to hold a bigger surprise  the beas estimate at 19 percent came in  percentage point below our estimate in the greenbook  however as best as we can tellbased on stillincomplete informationthe miss was attributable to lower estimates by the bea of farm inventory investment and of value added in the trading of used motor vehicles  our preliminary reading is that neither of these errors carries any signal for the forward momentum of the economy moving into the second half of the year  fridays employment report was likewise mercifully well behaved at least in the narrow sense of conforming to our expectation  private payroll employment declined an estimated 76000 in july together with small downward revisions to may and june that left the level of employment in july very close to our forecast  in addition the unemployment rate came in only a few basis points higher than we had expected
the only real news since greenbook publication came from the motor vehicle manufacturers  on friday they reported that sales of light vehicles in july were at an annual pace of 125 million units much weaker than our already weak forecast of
133 million units  moreover they knocked their assembly schedules for the third quarter down from 94 million units to 89 million units  taking their schedules on board would slice another  percentage point from our estimate of gdp growth in the third quarter  the manufacturers have already announced increases in incentives but it remains to be seen how vigorously consumers will respond in the current environment and how great the financial wherewithal of the manufacturers will prove to be to sustain such moves  in any event the drop in sales and production is certainly large enough to give renewed urgency to the question as to whether a broader retrenchment in spending might be in train
turning to the inflation side of the projection our forecast for core pce prices over the remainder of this year is nearly unchanged from the june greenbook  we still have core inflation stepping up from a little more than 2 percent during the first half of this year to a little more than 2 percent in the second half as the surge in prices for imports energy and other commodities passes through to retail prices and as some components that saw unusually low readings earlier in the year accelerate to a more normal rate of increase  next year with the pressures from import energy and commodity prices diminishing and with slack in resource utilization becoming a little greater we have core inflation dropping back to 2 percent  the projection for next year is also the same as in the june greenbook as the influences from lower energy prices and slightly greater economic slack are roughly offset by the pass through of higher import prices
the more dramatic changes in our inflation outlook came in the noncore pieces not surprisingly the plunge in oil prices since the june meeting caused us to whack our forecast for retail energy price inflation over the second half of this year  for next year however we marked up pce energy price inflation a little partly because natural gas futures prices have a more positive tilt than they did before and partly
because gasoline margins will still have some recovering to do  at the same time we have become more pessimistic about the outlook for food price inflation  the cpi for food in june came in at 08 percent much higher than our forecast of 03 percent
because we have mostly been surprised to the upside thus far this year we decided to move closer to our food price model which has been calling for larger increases than we were previously willing to write down  the net result as you saw in the greenbook is an outlook with faster food price inflation despite the fact that futures curves for both livestock and crops have moved down since the last meeting  all told we now have headline pce inflation running at an average annual pace of
3 percent over the second half of this year nearly 1 percentage point slower than in the june greenbook  for next year we have marked up total pce inflation by a few tenths in light of our reassessment of the food price situation and the slightly greater rise in energy prices that we now see next year
with regard to the risks in the outlook my sense is that the downside risks to economic activity have increased since the time of the june greenbook  that view is informed by two main factors  first while we have factored the more unsettled nature of the financial environment into our baseline outlook the situation seems more fragile than before and the implications for real activity of a sharp deterioration in financial conditions could be quite large  the first alternative scenario that we presented in the greenbookentitled severe financial stressupdates our periodic attempt to assemble an integrated macroeconomic and financial scenario  second the deterioration in the motor vehicles sector now to my eye more convincingly takes on the profile of what we usually see in the course of a typical recession  during the intermeeting period we will be on high alert for evidence suggesting that the weakness in vehicle sales is a harbinger of a broader shortfall in consumer spending
as for inflation the upside risks have in my view diminished somewhat  again two factors inform this assessment  first the downtick in the longterm inflation expectations measured in the reutersmichigan survey is somewhat reassuring
second the drop in oil prices is a welcome relief from the steady drumbeat of bad news from that sector and suggests a somewhat diminished probability that persistently high topline inflation will be reflected in a more serious erosion of household expectations with all the adverse implications for monetary policy that would entail  to be sure even with those favorable developments upside risks remain  we illustrated one such risk in the scenario entitled inflationary spiral in which we posited an initial shock to inflation expectations of 50 basis points followed by an adverse feedback loop that causes actual and expected inflation to chase each other up nearly 1 percentage point above baseline  monetary policy eventually brings the process under control but only over a lengthy period of time partly because the rule that we use in the simulations has policy responding to actual but not to expected inflation  steve kamin will now continue our presentation
mr kamin  for the next couple of weeks millions of people around the world will be watching the olympic games in beijing  for those of us charged with forecasting the global economy of course chinawatching is a yearround task  but
notably the most salient developments since your last meeting have arisen outside of china  chief among them of course have been the precipitous fluctuations in the price of oil  when the last fomc meeting concluded on june 25 the spot price of wti crude oil was running at 134 per barrel  it soared to over 145 by midjuly before plunging to about 119 as of this morning  the 26 per barrel drop over a threeweek period was the largest on record in nominal dollar terms although in percent terms the 18 percent decline weve seen has been exceeded on a couple of occasions in recent years  notably many other commodity prices especially those for natural gas and many food crops also declined sharply
it has been heartening and a welcome change to see oil prices undershoot rather than overshoot our previous forecast  but it would be premature to pop open the champagne  weve seen several other steep declines in oil prices in recent years that gave way to renewed upward surges and it remains to be seen whether an important shift in the supplydemand balance has occurred  saudi arabia added a total of 400000 barrels a day to its production of oil in may and june and there are indications that its production rose in july too  however these increases bring total opec production up only to their level in early 2006 and the world economy has grown considerably larger since then  analysts have cited gloomier forecasts of global economic growth and thus global oil demand as contributing to the weaker oil prices but those forecasts have been coming down for the past year with little apparent effect  although oil consumption in the industrial economies clearly has slowed over the past year we have yet to see either a concerted buildup in us oil inventories or any indications that oil demand among developing countries is slowing therefore a further lurch upward in oil prices is a distinct possibility  moreover  with spot and futures prices having first soared and then plunged since your last meeting the relatively flat path of oil prices that we are projecting is only about
12 per barrel lower on balance than in the previous forecast  in the meantime indicators of foreign growth have come in a bit weaker than we expected and inflation readings have been on the high side  these gloomier aspects of the international outlook counterbalance to some extent the improved tone of oil and other commodity markets
clearly prospects appear weakest in the advanced economies  consistent with our earlier forecasts of a sharp deceleration in activity we estimate that growth in all four of our largest industrial country trading partnerscanada the euro area the united kingdom and japancame in below 1 percent in the second quarter  in the united kingdom a sharp contraction in the housing sector appears set to drag the economy into a mild recession in the second half of this year  the remaining major economies should skirt recession but remain quite weak in the near term amid slackening export performance continued stresses in financial markets tightening credit standards and very sharp erosions in business and consumer confidence
why are the foreign industrial economies slowing about as much as in the united states when the subprime crisis originated in this country and the major drag on the
us economy is the slump in a nontradables sector housing  clearly part of the
story involves the international financial linkages that have led foreign markets and institutions to share in the stresses and losses induced by the us subprime crisis another part of the story involves a common shockthe global boom in oil and food pricesthat has cut into real household income and spending around the globe
third even as the persistent decline in the dollar since 2002 has buoyed us exports and growth this has come at the cost of trade performance and economic activity in our trading partners  finally the foreign industrial countries have enjoyed little or none of the substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus weve seen in the united states over the past year
we estimate that growth in the emerging market economies also slowed further in the second quarter to a pace of roughly 4 percent where we have it staying for the remainder of the year  obviously this is well above the growth rate of roughly
1 percent that weve penciled in for the industrial economies but it is still below their likely potential rate as many developing countries struggle with softening export demand and rising food and energy prices  notably however even after slowing in the second quarter estimated chinese growth powered on at about 10 percent
by 2009 we see both foreign advanced and emerging market economies accelerating as financial stresses ease the us economy picks up and commodity prices stop restraining the growth of real household incomes  this recovery scenario depends crucially on our projection that headline inflation starts moving down within the next quarter or two so that substantial monetary tightening is not needed  the recent decline in oil and other commodities prices provides some comfort that this scenario will materialize  however we saw some surprisingly sharp increases in consumer prices in june bringing 12month headline inflation to around 4 percent in the euro area and the united kingdom 5 percent in mexico and 6 percent in brazil in most of our major trading partners inflation excluding energy and food prices has remained better contained and in china headline inflation has actually moved down from its february peak of 87 percent registering 71 percent in june  even so until we see several quarters in a row of declines in aggregate measures of inflation we will not be out of the woods
so far the imprint of slowing foreign growth and rising foreign inflation on the
us external sector has been limited but not negligible  turning first to prices core import price inflation has moved up sharply from about 3 percent last year to
11 percent in the second quarter this was the fastest quarterly increase since 1987 most of this acceleration was concentrated in materialintensive goods such as food and industrial supplies and was likely due to rising commodity prices rather than to moregeneralized pricing pressures abroad  however inflation in imported finished goods also increased this year  as we noted in a special box in the greenbook prices of imports from china have been moving up briskly as a result of increases in domestic costs and in the value of the renminbi  this stepup in the socalled china price explains less than onefifth of the overall acceleration of core import prices but about onethird of the runup in inflation for finished goods imports  even so
assuming commodity prices stabilize going forward we expect changes in overall core import prices to slow quite substantially in coming quarters
so far us external sector performance has held up well in spite of the slowing global economy  net exports added 2 percentage points to real gdp growth in the second quarter the largest quarterly positive contribution since 1980  admittedly much of this reflected a 6 percent decline in imports which were dragged down both by weak us demand and the quirky seasonal pattern in the data on oil imports
even so exports expanded at a very healthy 9 percent supported both by the depreciation of the dollar and by continued robust demand for commodities  going forward we anticipate export growth holding up at a still healthy 7 percent or so as foreign economic growth picks up right around the time that the boost from previous dollar depreciation starts wearing off  the contribution of net exports to us gdp growth should move down but this will chiefly reflect a recovery in imports as the
us economy picks up  thank you  david and i will now be happy to address your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions for our colleagues  president fisher
mr fisher  david in terms of the relatively benign outlook for core inflation now and
for headline inflation im wondering what your assumptions are about margin compression and for
the ability of corporations to pass through price increases  by the way i found the core revisions
somewhat alarming because theyre well above 2 percent but less alarming than what i think i
heard you say about headline inflation projections  if my memory is correct over the past two years
there has been a wider spread between core and headline and part of that has been due to the ability
of firms at least to restrain or not to exploit any perceived pricing power  if youre assuming that
core will be relatively well behaved over time some assumptions must be in there about margins
and margin management and i wonder what they are  then i have a question for steve on the
international side to follow up on that
mr wilcox  by our highly imperfect measure of margins which we see through the
filter of the national income and product accounts margins at this point are somewhat above the
average over the past 30 years and we have them coming down for the nonfarm business sector
we have them coming down a little but not very much  so we have some slight erosion in
margins but they remain above average  in the corporate sector which is measured a little
differently from the overall nonfarm business sector margins are about average at the moment  so i
would not say that a big move in the markup of price over cost is a material driving factor in our
inflation outlook
mr fisher  obviously the implication of this more dire outlook for economic growth is
that movement of the top line will be very very difficult so again more pressure comes into the
margin side to see that one can satisfy shareholders that things arent as bad as they might be
thats really the nature of my concern  i dont know if were surveying or getting a sense as to the
pressures that people feel  im going to talk about some of that but you may be doing this more
formally than im able to do to get a sense of what kinds of pressures are occurring on margins
on the international side mr chairman if i maysteve im curious about these chinese
inflation numbers  as i understand from the chinese ministry of human resources the average
wage of urban workers rose 18 percent year over year in the first half of 08 and yet they report an
official inflation number that i believe you say is 4 or 5 percent of something  how do you square
that corner
mr kamin  well the short answer is that we dont have enough consistent sources of
data to square it  but you certainly point to a factor that many people have talked aboutthe
rapidly increasing wages particularly in those industrial areas on the seaboard that are responsible
for most of the manufacturing  its hard to square the relatively limited data that we have on those
wages with movements in overall cpi  but there too is a limitationthose cpi numbers that are
cited from china are mainly for urban areas so its hard to know how comparable those are with the
others  as you know theres also an extremely large food component in the chinese cpi  so
because basically food is probably less laborintensive than the types of manufacturing in which
most of the workers are working thats part of the way to square that  in some sense the food
prices arent reflecting those high wages as much  then a final wild card is that there are different
views on whats happening on both the level of profit margins in china and what theyve been
doing  a lot of anecdotal reports suggest that profit margins are razor thin and that they are being
squeezed  other analyses including some of the world banks suggest that those profit margins
are still pretty ample  so i think you correctly allude to an important phenomenonthe rising
wages because of high demand for workersbut were still busy sorting out the data to figure out
exactly how that maps into prices
mr fisher  thank you  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have two questions  first on the greenbook
forecast one thing that struck me is that there was a fairly large revision in your forecast for
nonresidential structures going forward  in fact after a pretty good showing in the first half of this
year you marked down the second half of this year for that and marked down substantially 2009  in
the last greenbook you had structures actually growing positively in 2009 now its minus 4
percent something like that  is that driven by something in the model or is that some adjustment
factor that was added in  if so what was the rationale for that or why might it be coming out
why do we have that change  then ill follow up with another question
mr wilcox  we dont quite understand why this sector seems to have resembled the
cartoon character that keeps running along when we think there shouldnt be any support
underneath it  laughter  we are staunchly negative about the second half for this sector and that
view is informed by the precipitous drop in the architectural billings index  thats one of the
relatively few indicators that gives us any purchase on whats going to happen in this sector  its a
helpful indicator of spending about six months ahead  we think that financial conditions are pretty
tough in this area  were getting a lot of anecdotal evidence that people are having greater difficulty
financing projects than was the case before and weve seen some uptick in vacancy rates as well
so we think all of those are factors  i guess i would say that weve heard very persistently negative
reports from our supervision colleagues as well about whats going on in that area
mr plosser  but the change is not just in the second half of this year  youve got a big
change for 09 too
mr wilcox  yes
mr plosser  if we think about the phrase that people usefinancial headwindsand
the credit problems that we see my interpretation of how the staff has modeled that is on the
demand sideof restrained credit limiting demand  but i can also think of the financial sector as
having been hit by a very significant productivity shock if you will where the production function
for intermediation has taken a huge productivity shock to it  so in thinking about a model in which
that has happened you might find yourself thinking about the consequences of that particularly
how that affects the path of potential output over the near term  if you think that type of shock is
driving potential output down over the near term depending on the magnitude of that it is going to
affect your estimates of the gaps and therefore your estimates of inflation and what the economy
looks like going forward  so i guess my second question is have you thought much about this or
is much of this incorporated in the evolution of your output gaps or your potential output measures
working through that channel  if so what might be the ramifications for inflation and policy going
forward
mr reifschneider  ill take that because we did have a bit of an internal debate on
that issue awhile back  in particular spencer dale who was visiting us from the bank of england
was basically making exactly the same point youre making and raising that issue
mr plosser  so maybe im not so kooky after all  laughter
mr reifschneider  no
mr kroszner  but we sent him out of the country  laughter
mr reifschneider  one test is whether in previous periods of financial stress like
this we saw what might be more upward inflation pressure than we otherwise could explain or
productivity performance that we had trouble explaining  after looking at the experience during the
early 1990s in the headwinds period and trying to think about the likely magnitude of the effects of
such a productivity shock coming out of the financial system we decided that you could see a
negative productivity shock of that sort going on but that its effects are overwhelmed by the fallout
from its effect on demand  so although there might be some negative productivity shock on net it
turns out to be more of a disinflationary effect  but we also had difficulty seeing it show up in
productivity data  that said that would be extremely hard for us to find  you know it could be
there and we just couldnt find it
mr plosser  so in the way youve modeled this in your forecast are you thinking of
yourselves as modeling that net effect or do you think of yourselves as modeling and forecasting
just one side  have you made any effort to incorporate both sides of this potential effect  even
though it may be small the question is how small it is
mr reifschneider  weve made no explicit adjustment for that in the potential output
assumptions we have going in  looking back it was hard to see that there was much if any effect
but thats a risk knowing that there could be some productivity effect and its just hard to find
mr plosser  thank you
mr wilcox  may i just augment my earlier answer  i spoke about the nonresidential
building sector  another factor taking down overall nonresidential spending is that the lower energy
price trajectory reduces our expectation for drilling and mining expenditures which have also
fallen
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  a question for steve  could you review
your thought process on core import prices and comment on how sensitive our inflation projections
are to the assumption of i believe moderation in core import prices in 2009
mr kamin  sure  as i mentioned core import price inflation shot up very rapidly to
over 10 percent in the second quarter and our approach toward modeling and predicting core import
price inflation focuses on three main sources of increase  first are increases in foreign cost
pressures which we proxy by cpis which have not been a particularly important driver of core
import prices as of late though they are not negligible  then the other two which are more
important are declines in the dollar which push up our prices and finally increases in commodity
prices because a lot of our imports even core imports which exclude oil and hightech products
still have a lot of commodity input into them  for the past few years our experience has been that
the passthrough of declines in the dollar into core import prices has been relatively moderate  it
has definitely contributed materially to the increase in core import prices but not as much we feel
as the runup in commodity prices which has had a pretty substantial effect  one way that we can
sort of confirm that impression is that we know that the prices of imported materialintensive
products that have the most commodity input have gone up much more rapidly than prices of
finished goods and that has been true over the past year as well  so for all of those reasons we feel
that commodity prices have been the prime impetus for the runup in core import price inflation
going forward we take our guidance from the futures markets which indicate that oil prices and
other commodity prices will flatten out  as a result we anticipate that relatively shortly core
import price inflation also should start to decline  at the same time our anticipation is that
compared with the past few years the dollar will fall less rapidly going forward than in the past and
that should be another factor supporting our view that core import price inflation should diminish
chairman bernanke  steve you might want to define core import price inflation
its not analogous to the other core
mr kamin  right  so yes thank you  in the case of core imports we exclude oil
which is very important as well as computers and semiconductors
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i have a question similar to president plossers  both the
financial shockthe housing adjustmentand the big relative price shock you could say all in
different forms could hurt the rate of growth of the economys productive potential  you could say
that they all might in some dimension reduce the nearterm expected path of potential growth  i
guess my question is that you have this costly sectoral reallocation alternative scenariodo you
attribute any effect on potential growth over the forecast period in your baseline to the combined
effect of the housing adjustment and the big relative price shock from energy
mr wilcox  no  one of the facts that we learn from microeconomic data about for
example job flows is that there is always a huge astonishing amount of churnjob destruction and
job creationjust astonishing and thats true even in normal macroeconomic times  so the
background radiation level is not zero  but we havent incorporated in our baseline any allowance
for greater cost and thats what this alternative scenario was intended to illustrate making a pretty
generous allowance for the potential effect of that sectoral reallocation on the productive capacity of
the economy  but its a serious question
mr reifschneider  theres one minor qualification to what david just said  we do
keep track of rough estimates of what we think that the rise in energy prices over the past few years
is possibly doing to trend productivity and weve come up with estimates that maybe its 01  we
think that effect has been ongoing and it is built into the data  in some sense its occurring and so
in some sense its in our trend estimates  it is not as though our trends arent implicitly taking in the
fact that theres an ongoing loss in productivity associated with rising energy prices
vice chairman geithner  i was just going to say that i thought the interesting thing
about that scenario was that it doesnt really change your view about the appropriate path of
monetary policy going forward  its basically at the baseline  so even if you were to build in a
material change in potential growth because of the effects on demand going forward it doesnt
affect your view about the appropriate path of policy
mr wilcox  the reason is that it operates like a classic supply shock which presents
monetary policy with just simply a less pleasant policy menu to choose from and in the context of
that costly sectoral reallocation the economy is running closer to its productive capacity  lets see
i lost my train of thought here
mr reifschneider  well basically you can just stop there  laughter  its the
tradeoff between the two  obviously if you were more concerned about inflation outcomes than
real activity outcomes you might tilt it a different way
chairman bernanke  isnt it true though that changes in potential growth also have
demand effects as wellto some extent offsetting
mr reifschneider  yes
vice chairman geithner  yes  it means that its another way of saying that you
wouldnt expect the estimates of the nowprevailing equilibrium real fed funds rate to be higher
not to stretch this too far but another way of saying why the likely expected path or the appropriate
path of policy doesnt change in terms of the nominal fed funds rate is that we have these offsetting
effects on demand
mr reifschneider  yes
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  regarding a comment that bill dudley made
about housing prices for financial institutions its going to matter a lot whether were looking at a
decline from 15 percent to 20 percent or from 15 percent to 30 percent  housing inventories unsold
homes are very high and i guess im wondering againwe have gone over this a few timeswhat
factors are likely to get housing advancing if its not a sharp decline in housing prices  im having a
hard time understanding why the expectation would not be for a relatively sharp decline  im
translating the greenbookofheo numbers to bills numbers and im not sure but it seems to me
that financial institutions ought to be thinking that a significant adjustment must still be in train if
were not expecting demand to pick up all of a sudden  the mortgage origination challenges are
there  or is this disequilibrium just going to sit there for an extended period of time
mr wilcox  i guess i would push back on the premise that we dont have a pretty
significant adjustment in house prices built into our baseline  we have house prices as measured by
ofheo declining 7 percent this year and another 5 percent in 2009 and i wouldnt anticipate any
rebound in 2010  you know our ability to measure where that would leave house prices relative to
some notion of fair valuation is incredibly imprecise  but one regressionbased indicator that we
follow suggests that it would have house prices relative to rents swinging from a relatively high
valuation to a noticeably low valuation  charles fleischman illustrated this yesterday in his pre
fomc briefing  the major factor that provides some reason for optimism is that construction starts
are now low enough that builders are making progress in chipping away their inventory of unsold
homes  the months supply figures remain extraordinarily high because the denominator is very
low but in terms of units of unsold homes my recollection is that weve chipped away about half
the runup in terms of absolute number of units in inventory  we also have starts continuing to
come down materially from their current level  so we think that the process will begin to get
inventories into a more normal alignment
mr evans  the staff has been way out front in projecting the housing decline and that
has been very helpful  is there any dissonance between what bill said and your pretty substantial
expectation of housingprice declines
mr wilcox  i dont think so
mr evans  was it 15 to 20 or 15 to 30
mr dudley  i think what makes it complicated though is that theres a nonlinearity  if
the housingprice declines do turn out to be on the higher side it then puts more stress on the
financial system and on credit availability which then leads to a weaker economy which then puts
more stress on the housing sector  so small differences in the path get amplified
mr evans  i agree with that chain and those risks but what i thought i was hearing from
david was that the staff estimate has in it quite a substantial adjustment process in housing and then
i would expect financial players to share that assessment
mr dudley  i wasnt really addressing the point estimate of where housing was going
as opposed to the uncertainty around that estimate  i would argue that the uncertainty around that
estimate is still quite wide  at some point it will be resolved  when it is resolved that will be a
favorable development but i dont think were there yet
mr wilcox  i would just augment bills comment with two other observations  theres
plenty of probability mass out in the tail  i think it actually is twosided risk  we illustrated one
side of that risk in our severe financial stress scenario  the other point i would make is that our
projection for national houseprice declines of 12 percent cumulative in 2008 and 2009 makes
plenty of room for a very much more severe decline in florida california and other highly stressed
areas and we have attempted to take that regional diversity into account  its a rough exercise to be
sure but were not oblivious to the fact that some areas are doing much worse than the average
that is the nature of averages
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  vice chairman did you have an intervention
vice chairman geithner  i was just going to say this  i think that you can do crude
estimates of likely total losses across the us economy and credit markets in a scenario like the
baseline scenario in the greenbook and if you use nellie liangs study or the stuff done in new
york theres a huge amount ahead still  even though financial market prices now reflect an
expectation for houseprice declines that are not significantly more optimistic than davids baseline
scenario i dont think you can say with confidence now that financial institutions have already
provisioned for or written down losses to accommodate that  because the trajectory of house prices
will depend in part on financial behaviorthe availability of creditas financial institutions catch
up and adjust to that and adjust capital and asset growth et cetera there is some risk that youll push
that expected path of house prices down further from where it is  so if institutions have to prepare
for the possibility that youre going to have a much weaker economic outcome because theres
some probability around that then theres a risk that they will produce that outcome through the
combined effects of their behavior which is why were living with such a delicate balance
mr evans  they do seem to be taking out a lot of insurance on the downside right
like your merrill lynch put option
mr dudley  theyve had to pay a lot for not very much insurance in the case of merrill
lynch
chairman bernanke  president rosengrensorry  president lacker an
intervention
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  just to point out that it must be the case that
lower house prices have a positive effect on the homeownership rate  so there must be some
mitigation some good effect  were obviously getting to where we need to get eventually  the
question i have for the staff about this is have you thought about the sequence  i mean it strikes
me that were likely to get to a point of stability in prices and construction activity before we get
months supply back down to some historical norm  because its sort of a stop variable are you
guys expecting it to converge smoothly and have you thought about what measures of activity you
expect to see stabilize first
mr wilcox  we expect starts to stabilize next year and that will be followed by a pretty
considerable period of several quarters with house prices finally stabilizing  but we think that
builders will look ahead and see that theyve cut their additions to supply by enough to make even
more rapid progress against their inventory of unsold homes  the question of the dynamics of
house prices is a tricky one because it depends on what model of expectations one assumes that
homebuyers will have  if every homeowner were a rational economic being then its pretty
unambiguous that a lower level of home prices would elicit greater optimism on the part of home
shoppers that gee the valuation is better compared with yesterday i should be more enthusiastic
about getting into the housing market i should be happier today than i was yesterday  i think its at
least an open question as to whether expectations arent more extrapolative than that  we havent
seen any diminution in for example the michigan survey in response to what homeowners expect
to happen over the coming 12 months and i think its a serious possibility that they look at their
recent experience and extrapolate that forward and conclude that over the next 12 months the user
cost of owning a home is going to be really high  we just dont have a very good grip on exactly
what the dynamics of prices and housing demand will be
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  i just want to point out that we hear a fair amount of anecdotal feedback
suggesting that just determining what is the net real price for a house is not so easy because of
incentives particularly in multifamily but also new homes in general  you pay list but you get a
mercedes and a years worth of gasoline and your lawn mowed and a lot of things thrown in for the
seller to hold the price close to what the list is  so i dont know how these things are actually
measured to take into account those kinds of incentives
mr wilcox  i dont know what the ofheo does to capture the quality of automobile
that comes in the driveway  laughter  i suspect that theres no adjustment for that
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  on the inventories and the sequencing which i think is very interesting
because of how it plays out i learned recentlyand you can correct me if this is wrongthat in
the inventory of new homes for sale the way thats counted includes permits that have been issued
even though theres no home thats been built  so a developer may get permits but may not have
started the home yet  it may just be sitting on a pile of permits  so if thats correct and i think it is
it means that if you think about the sequencing of whats going to happen as demand begins to turn
around those permits dont have to get bought but they may start building on permits that theyve
already been issued and they havent started building yet  is that a correct way of looking at the
data
mr wilcox  i dont know what the story is with regard to permits that youre
mentioning  i do know that the cancellation rate of new home sales has declined a bit  previously
we were emphasizing that the high level of cancellations that the builders were experiencing was
actually causing the supply situation to be even worse than one would infer from the census bureau
data  now the cancellation rates have come down and so that situation is not as severe as it was six
or nine months ago i believe
chairman bernanke  president rosengren you have been patient
mr rosengren  my question is for steve  there have been judgmental adjustments to
the domestic forecast reflecting financial headwinds in the united states  im wondering if we
made the same adjustments for financial headwinds in europe  you highlighted that residential
investment looks a bit different in europe but they do have a lot of capital losses in their banking
system  their liborois spread is quite elevated and at least in some european countries
ireland and spain as well as the united kingdom which you mentionedhousing has been quite
soft  are you doing judgmental forecasts to reflect those headwinds or do we do it on the domestic
side but not for the european outlook
mr kamin  as you correctly point out europe in particular does indeed have a lot of
financial stresses and some parts of europe particularly the united kingdom as well as ireland and
spain are looking at some very serious weaknesses on the housing side  so we are indeed kind of
in parallel but not exactly the same as our domestic colleagues building financial stresses into our
outlook  we dont necessarily increase or decrease the amount of financial stress in our forecast in
lockstep with the domestic side  in particular the european financial situation has probably gotten
a bit worse over the intermeeting period but some indicators havent deteriorated to quite the extent
that they have in the united states  nonetheless we have built in a fair amount of financial stress
one factor thats worth keeping in mind is that we built it into our outlook fairly early on  so we
havent adjusted downward the outlook for europe by that much compared with the last couple of
greenbooks but we had already built in quite a bit of weakening of activity and a lot of that does
reflect both the direct effects of financial stresses as well as their knockon effects on tightening
credit standards for banks
chairman bernanke  i have president fisher and then if its okay with everybody
we should probably start our goround  president fisher
mr fisher  very quickly i want to come back to the housing issue  you know ive
been more pessimistic than i think anybody around the table from the standpoint of peaktotrough
correction and i find the numbers you mentioned very benign relative to my expectations  one
issue that im trying to understand a little better in terms of its likely effect is that the real bulge in
resets comes in 2009 to 2012 because thats when the alta resets kick in  we talked about this
many many moons ago the ultrapoor documentation on those types of loans in particular and im
wondering to what degree youre factoring this into your outlook going forward particularly for
those outyears
mr wilcox  were certainly aware of that  to my eye the numbers look astonishingly
negative  for foreclosures we have 25 million foreclosures this year and another 2 million
foreclosures next year  we have a very bleak landscape built into the projection
mr fisher  on that happy note mr chairman thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you president fisher  the goround  president
lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  the contours and basic outcomes of
atlantas forecast are similar to the baseline of the greenbook forecast  so i want to focus my
remarks this morning on the underlying assumptions in both forecastsassumptions that i view as
pivotal and if we miscalculate could result in a longerterm policy error
it seems that at every meeting theres great uncertainty around the outlook and this juncture
is no different  i perceive considerable uncertainty and debatable assumptions in the basecase
scenario  as i see it the key assumptions broadly are that housing stabilizes perhaps as indicated
by housing prices in the second half of 09  inflation pressures intensify in the near term but then
abate because of economic slack and lower commodity prices and as discussed core import prices
recent declines in oil prices stick and prices remain more or less flat  certainly since the
greenbook was published we note the fluctuations just in the past few days that were referred to
earlier and i also cant dismiss geopolitical risks and the potential of a severe shock  finally
financial market stress will persist for some months but diminish next year  these assumptions
using the respectable term assumptions have the feeling to me of bets not so respectable a
term  the policy assumption integral to both the greenbook and the atlanta forecasts could be
added to this and that is that rate rises starting in 2009 wont choke off improving growth and will
be enough to blunt remaining inflation pressures
so ill devote my comments to input from regional and other contacts that either serve to
confirm or cast doubt on these assumptions  we oriented this cycles questions to our atlanta and
branch directors to first evidence of wage pressures and passthrough of higher costs  in
interpreting the feedback we noted some confusion between a businesss management of its labor
costs versus general wage pressures  we heard that businesses are working to keep their total wage
bills in check by raising wages for key talent but letting less critical employees go or cutting their
work hours as an offset  the reduction in hours is attributed to some combination of weaker
product demand and increased average productivity  rising unemployment appears to be keeping
wage demands in check  there are exceptions such as the oil field services industry for which
qualified staff are in short supply and certain skilled industrial and business trades in which local
bottlenecks exist  in businesses enjoying strong export demand some employers are utilizing
bonuses rather than commitment to permanent wage increases  so our regional contacts did not
indicate the development of broadbased underlying pressures on labor costs reflecting wage
demands  as for inflation passthrough our contacts reported widespread and growing efforts to
pass through higher input costs  passthrough efforts appear to be the rule rather than the exception
as one branch director put it people are passing through costs like crazy using high energy costs as
cover
the reports of my supervision staff regarding banking conditions indicate a continuing
decline in asset quality and a very nervous interbank funding market  foreclosed properties both
singlefamily and condo are making up the majority of house sales and slowing the absorption of
the oversupply of new homes  some contacts are very concerned about the prospect of a second
wave of foreclosures as option arm mortgage borrowers mostly concentrated in large states like
florida and californiathese are borrowers who are currently paying less than the accrued
interestrun up against maximum loantovalue ceilings  new higher gse standards are resulting
in fewer borrowers being qualified putting downward pressure on house prices and bringing more
foreclosures  virtually all comparables for florida residential valuation are based on forced sales
and foreclosures we are told  beyond the deterioration in real estate portfolios banks are reporting
growing problems in credits to food distributors restaurants trucking and other petroleum fuel or
inputintensive industries
based on my calls with financial market contacts it seems thatno surprisemuch of the
attention in financial markets has shifted from private fixedincome markets to fannie and freddie
fixedincome markets for private securities appeared to have improved relative to their lows since
the current financial turmoil began  although significant concerns remain it appears that
leveragedloan deals are getting done  volume is down spreads are up and the deals are very
conservative but deals are getting done  that said one of the patterns in my calls over the past year
has been that every time one concern abates another seems to jump up and take its place
although the recent legislation appears to have alleviated concerns about the fannie and freddie
senior debt my contacts indicate that there is widespread uncertainty about what will happen to
junior securities if the treasury injects funds  furthermore more than once i heard the view that
foreign holders of gse debt are concerned that their positions are not as safe as they believed  one
contact mentioned that the 18month term of the guarantee is reportedly affecting some holders
maturity choices  in response to my question about the relative weakness of european banks one
contact suggested that they have booked much of their troubled assets in the hold to maturity
account suggesting slower recognition of losses and difficulties ahead  we confirmed with one
large regional bank cfo significant deterioration of helocs in their portfolio and by implication
broadly among regional banks  the option arm problem by contrast is perceived to be possibly
the next shoe to drop but as i said earlier not uniformly distributed across the country  finally we
heard the view that markets perceive banks as facing protracted difficulty raising capital
to conclude the downside risks to growth have not diminished in my opinion  on the flip
side i agree that the upside risks to inflation are obviously a serious concern  in particular i put a
fair amount of weight on the possibility that inflation will not moderate sufficiently without a more
substantial tightening of monetary policy than that projected in the greenbook baseline  my
intermeeting internal and external discussions make it difficult for me to dismiss some of the
alternative scenarios in the greenbook specifically the severe financial stress scenario the
typical recession scenario and the inflationary spiral scenario and in a highuncertainty
environment i dont view any of these scenarios as exclusive of another  that said i see the risks
to both the inflation and the growth objectives as very roughly in balance at this time  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  overall there has been little change in the
sentiment of my business contacts since our last meeting  most are still reporting sluggish domestic
demand with little evidence of any improvement over the near term  on the price front everyone
continued to cite cost pressures  manufacturers have long lists of materials cost increases while
retailers note large increases in wholesale prices of imported consumer goods  everyone discusses
how they are planning to continue passing these costs along to customers in secondround effects
undoubtedly weak market conditions will limit their efforts but i suspect that many will be
successful in raising prices significantly
turning to the financial situation to start i should note that i did hear some good reports
with regard to liquidity in chicago financial markets  a contact at the chicago mercantile
exchange told us that they conducted extensive liquidity reviews for their largest clearing members
with special scrutiny of firms that had substantial volumes of hardtovalue assets on their books
the clearinghouse was very pleased with the results finding that these firms had good access to
liquidity
overall however my financial conversations this round were relatively downbeat  i did
hear some interesting details though about the dynamics of the restructuring of credit
intermediation  with commercialmortgagebacked securities markets effectively shut down a
highly rated ownerdeveloper of highend shopping malls described his increasingly difficult
attempts to find funding for his regular flow of balloon payments on mortgage properties  he has
gone from restrictive loans from life insurance companies to attempting to put together his own
structureddebt securitization  they want to issue bonds backed by the revenues generated from a
pool of their highquality properties and sell them to major fixedincome investment funds  this is
one example of what economists like kashyap and shin estimate will be a reduction of at least
1 trillion in lending to nonfinancial institutions due to mortgagerelated losses at us financial
institutions  it is also an example of how firms are trying to find workarounds for the functions that
intermediaries used to do for them  but such restructuring must be raising the cost of financing in
ways that are not obviously amenable to mitigation through liquidity policies
turning to the national outlook the information we have received over the past several
weeks has contained many crosscurrents but overall our forecast for output growth is little changed
from our june projections  with regard to prices i am concerned that inflation risks continue to
grow  the most recent news on core prices has not been good  oil prices may be coming off the
boil but they are still scalding  prices are still down only to where they were in may  my
impression from my contact calls is that the ultimate passthrough to final product prices of earlier
increases could take a disconcertingly long period of time  furthermore i continue to think that the
current funds rate in conjunction with our enhanced lending facilities represents a quite
accommodative monetary policy stance even given the disruptions in financial markets  if the
policy path remains as accommodative as futures markets expect then improvement in inflation will
most likely require fortuitous favorable developments in inflation expectations and more restraint
from resource slack than we might have otherwise expected
this brings me to three considerations that i would like to highlight as we evaluate the risk
management positions underlying our views on appropriate policy and our economic projections
the first factor is that according to many econometric estimates the 5 to 6 percent unemployment
rate envisioned in the projections would provide only very modest restraint on inflation  in
addition costly reallocation could lead to less resource slack perhaps temporarily driving the
nairu above 5 percent  you know when i talk to my staff they assure me that there are very
good reasons demographically based to believe a nairu under 5 percent  but i tend to think ive
read a few too many papers on policy and policy mistakes where thats exactly the issuewhen you
think the sustainable unemployment rate is lower than it actually is  so thats a risk i think
the second factor is that many individuals and businesses see the large relative price
changes in oil food and commodities as precursors to morepersistent inflation  whether or not
their assessments are analytically correct depends on their expectations of our policy response  a
substantive response may be necessary to prevent selffulfilling price increases and keep inflation
under control  words can take us only so far
the third consideration is the potential diminishing returns through our efforts to mitigate
distressed financial market conditions  it is my interpretation that our current accommodative
monetary policy and suite of lending facilities are set to mitigate severe downside risks and the
systemic risks that you mentioned earlier mr chairman  this is helpful under the assumption that
reducing liquidity strains will assist financial markets to return to normal operations and prevent a
permanent impairment of our financial infrastructure  but financial conditions seem unlikely to
return to our previous perceptions of normal at least for some time  thus i see a risk that extra
accommodation intended to grease the financial wheels could be left in place too long and prove
counterproductive for price stability  indeed the old perception of normal likely is not the correct
benchmark for us to use in looking for whether we are experiencing structural changes in the
intermediation process in which new liquidity providers are playing enhanced roles in the lending
process and in which risk standards are changing  so when thinking about market functioning it
would be useful to discuss this within a longerterm framework of what we can feasibly expect from
market functioning and what central bank liquidity has the ability to usefully and appropriately
influence  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i may have to leave the lunch early  so before i start i do
want to bid rick adieu  rick i remember describing you as charming in one of our early meetings
you have charmed me by your intellect and devotion  anyway im going to miss you  so i
wanted to say that in case i do have to leave early
mr chairman in the intermeeting period i spent almost as much time in president
rosengrens district as i did in my ownpart as vacation but the rest consulting with some
advisers and mentors in the peoples republic of cambridge at my alma mater  laughter  i
mention this because i want to underscore that in arguing a perspective i tend to move away from
the rather felicitous circumstances that prevail in my district  even though things are slowing we
still expect employment growth to come in a little short of 2 percent a year and our banking
situation thus far is holding up rather well
in terms of my national soundings and you know the list and the group is familiar with it
the anecdotal evidence from everyonefrom the bankers to the credit card companies to retailers to
fuel producers food producers energy companies shippers equipment manufacturers
homebuilders and entertainment companiesconfirms reports of progressively higher obstacles to
growing their top lines and continued efforts to drive down their cost of goods sold through
reducing their head counts running very tight inventory cycles tightening their operating expenses
and reexamining and in many cases cutting back significantly on capex  nationally i expect
continued anemia on the growth side  we are as you know not at the extreme but at the low end of
expectations for economic growth  i would expect zero growth as we approach yearend  as i said
earlier from our perspective were only about twothirds through the peaktotrough correction on
housing and i view that as a continued weak influence  so the summary is that most of my contacts
are planning around expectations of a prolonged us and advancedcountry slowdown and have a
rather woeful outlook as to the growth side
at the same time there is also a woeful concern with regard to price pressuresintensifying
cost pressures affecting their margins at a time when the stock market is most unforgiving of people
who miss their mark  even in the first district i might note  i want to quote the beige book report
from boston  almost all contacted manufacturers voiced concerns about elevated    costs   
respondents generally have raised their selling prices in recent months    over onehalf of
contacts expect to increase their selling prices further in the second half of 2008 andor early 2009
it went on to say that while some contacts express worry that price increases have led or will lead to
loss of market shares others indicate thatand these are the key operative wordscustomers have
become more receptive to price increases because they see them as a consequence of generalized
cost pressures  mr chairman that passage captures the message that im receiving from my ceo
and cfo contacts around the country  by and large we appear to be transitioning from vigilance
on the price front to acquiescence  inflation expectations are i think becoming unmoored and i
believe they are if not already adrift at risk of drifting
on the small business front i do like to look at bill dunkelbergs recent reports from the
national federation of independent business  his most recent report indicates that the percentage
of small business owners citing inflation as the number one problem they face rose to 20 percent
in june the highest rating since 1982 and that 41 percent of his respondents report raising selling
prices  at the other extreme of size to put this in perspective walmarts ceo for the united
states reported last weekand i quote this  my biggest concern is inflation  this month we had
an experience that walmart has never everthats literally what he saidhad before which is
that a major supplier told us we need a 9 percent increase or we will not supply you at all  now he
did not mention the name of that supplier  it could have been unilever which saw the volume of
goods it ships slip 05 percent year over year in the second quarter  yet according to our
conversations but also quoted in the wall street journal on august 1 unilevers ceo reported that
he raised average prices on his thousands of products 74 percent and then added that he doesnt
plan to reverse any price increases  or it could have been one of the largest snack food companies
whose cfo has informed us that after taking and having stick a 9 percent increase in price in
marchi reported this at our last meetingthey will effect another 9 percent increase in october
heres the pithy quote he gave me  thus far weve been bleeding out price increases to our
customers  now our strategy is to bludgeon themto broadcast our increases in the expectation
that competitors will do the same  i doubt the supplier to walmart was kodak  last week the
new york times reported that hurt by higher manufacturing and materials costs the company said
it will combat these cost pressures by passing on to consumers and raising prices on some products
by as much as 20 percent
i have lots of examples of similar responses  president evans indicated similar pressures
president lockhart did too  im not going to go through them  i will add by the way the one thing
that surprised me  despite disneys brilliant annual report of record earnings they too plan to
raise their single day prices by 5 percent to 60 in the next quarter  there is also a growing
feeling which i havent heard before among semiconductor manufacturers that after years and
years of constant price deflation they expect that there mayand the operative word is maybe
a bottoming out because of the raw materials prices they face and the wage prices and pressures
they are receiving in china which has become a major semiconductor manufacturer
one might take heart from the recent correction in commodity prices  i agree with steve
that we have to be very careful about that  my smartest energy contacts have been expecting a
correction in prices  markets were overshooting  natural gas prices have reacted to recent
developments like the barnett shale and even more important the socalled haynesville play in
louisiana  the oilies note that increased saudi supply hit our shores with the normal sixweek
lag  they were talking about production increases in may and june and those have just hit our
shores recently  so theyre not surprised at the price reaction at the pump  but none feels that the
basic demandsupply situation has been dramatically alteredmuch as you argued steveand
most expect structural prices to obtain at or near current levels  now what does at or near current
levels mean in terms of price impact  i had a long conversation with the ceo of burlington
northern and just for data purposes in terms of what they call their rcafan automatic cost
adjustment contract that covers 25 percent of the goods shipped by their railtheir thirdquarter
rcaf is 17 percent  the 75 percent of products that are not covered by that automatic contract are
subject to a fuel surcharge  that fuel surcharge at 120 a barrel is a 30 percent increase for the third
quarter
one might also take comfort in the purported calmness in compensation growth seen so far
along the lines of what i read in the financial times by mark gertler on july 29  i dont hear
confirmation of that benign argument among business operators  first as president evans and mr
stockton pointed out in our last meeting labor compensation is not a good predictor of inflation  i
remember dave said that its not that labor costs which are a significant chunk of business costs
dont matter but that you cant necessarily take comfort from the wellbehaved compensation thus
far that you are not going to confront some inflation problems going forward  now the last
anecdote i want to give you illustrates that point  yesterday i had a lengthy visit with the cfo of
general mills  until their fiscal year 08 which ended in may they priced over many years an
average increase of 0 percent  they took 2 percent as the year ended and theyre taking another 5
percent this year  they are having to reexamine their elasticity models he said  here is what he
said that worried me the most  they are finding those models less predictive because a
everybody is raising prices and b consumer perception is that inflation is back  so again
vigilance is giving way to acquiescence
mr chairman i do want to comment very briefly on something i mentioned last time
which regards calculating the cost of goods sold  i am hearing more and more from companies that
have shifted production to china a verification of the 18 percent number that the ministry gave us
whether its a hospital producer whom i talked to in california or a black  decker tool assembler
in china theyre complaining not only about cost increases of 15 to 20 percent depending on
whether youre operating in the north or south but also about the employee contract law that was
just put into place which in essence allows for almost an oldfashioned scala mobile italianfrench
model which feeds a wageprice spiral and it is beginning to infect their wage cost and inject
rigidities into their ability to operate in china
so overall mr chairman i am concerned obviously about economic growth  i think we
as president lockhart mentioned are in a very difficult spot  we have three enormously worrisome
scenarios facing us  i think we have to be very careful how we word ourselves on inflation  last
night at 600 national public radio opened their marketplace report with this headline  the fed
fuels your pain  we have a perception issue that we must address and there are two ways to do
it  one is by being strong in terms of how we argue the case of inflation  the other is to act by
raising rates  im going to listen very very carefully because frankly im undecided here as to
what the right approach is  but i think we have to be careful when we state a balance of risks
which are enormous that we dont understate the fact that inflation is now being accommodated in
the minds of the marketplace  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher im going to ask you a very innocent
question  youve given many chilling anecdotes over the last few meetings about increases in
prices but the official statistics just dont show anything like that outside of oil gas gasoline and
the direct commodity price increases  do you believe that the cpi is not an accurate measure
mr fisher  well i do see the cpi rising  the monthly report was not encouraging  the
last 12 months have not been encouraging and i think what worries me is the spread between core
and headline  core is rising as well by the way  even our own estimates indicate that  i do see it
in headline numbers  the numbers i saw that were just reported i thought were quite alarming
you are seeing the passthrough  youre hearing evidence of this in the anecdotal reports  i do
believe mr chairman that its visible in the data  im just trying to report what im hearing from
the field against the background of much more sophisticated analysis which i respect enormously
what im worried about is the perception
i do believe that the data are very imperfect on inflation expectationsi noticed that david
said that about the furtherout expectations in the michigan survey  if you look at the reliability of
the data the oneyear survey which has risen significantly has been quite reliable over time  the
fivetotenyeari dont know if theyre talking about ten years five years or somewhere between
the two and i dont think statistically thats been a very accurate indicator historically but im not
sure about that  so we have very imperfect hard data on inflation expectations and i think thats
when anecdotal evidence may be helpful  all im trying to do mr chairman is report to you what
im hearing from the field and not from my district and i hope it is useful in the deliberations
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i think theres no question that headline inflation is very high right now
clearly when you get these kinds of increases in energy prices and food costs youre going to have
to reflect them in current prices  in fact thats exactly what you need to have happen so that relative
prices shift  the reality is that high oil prices have to mean that real wages fall  people have to
conserve and not drive as much and so forth  so this is a normal process and monetary policy does
not control these relative price shifts  what i think is more critical is that although there are some
problems in terms of core the effect has actually been quite limited given the incredible rise in
energy prices  while its important to think about headline in the long run the information from
core is very useful in terms of thinking about policy because it tells you whether this is spilling over
into underlying inflation
one of my concerns about going to anecdotal information and why i think we need to use an
analytic framework in thinking about what is really driving the inflation process is that we do need
to focus on the longerrun because thats what monetary policy can control  i get a bit nervous
about these anecdotal concerns which i think can tell us something about headline  then we have
to ask what they tell us about the longerrun context but not put too much weight on them  thats
one reason that i think some of the analytic frameworks that weve developed here are very useful
for thinking about these things  thank you
mr fisher  well in terms of the weight again im just one of 17 or 18 and i would
weigh it accordingly  but i am worried that weve had a spread between headline and core for a
long period now  i am worried that were seeing core expectations pick upmodestly but they are
beginning to pick up  i am worried that core expectations are above 2 percent  and i am
particularly worried about developments on the global wage front in terms of how it affects the cost
of goods sold here in the united states
one last thing that i just started to detectand again its all just hearsaybut im
increasingly hearing reports of concerns of people who operate companies about the welfare of their
employees and about their ability to pay transportation costs pay food costs and maintain the value
of their 401k plans and as president lockhart reported some way to try to manage if not through
formal demands on wages at least to try to cushion their welfare  these are marginal influences
and i dont disrespect the analytical side  i do worry that data capture history and im trying to give
myself a sense for what is happening at the margin in terms of microeconomic behavior and the
report is only what its worth  its just one input in the many  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  economic activity in the eighth district has
remained roughly stable during the summer  activity in the services sector has increased slightly
and except for the auto industry manufacturing activity is also stable to slightly higher  automotive
contacts reported a variety of plans to lay off workers or to idle production and at least three
automotive parts suppliers will close plants in the district  contacts in the auto industry are not
optimistic that production will increase in the short term  retail and auto sales have softened in
recent weeks and some district retail contacts have expressed concerns about summer sales  many
contacts continue to emphasize commodity price levels as a key factor in business decisions  they
are concerned both about the necessary business adjustments given the new pricing structure and
about the implications for the overall level of inflation going forward
the residential real estate sector continues to decline  across four of the main metropolitan
areas in the district home sales through may declined about 18 percent compared with 2007
whereas singlefamily construction permits declined about 40 percent  the number of foreclosures
in the st louis area in the second quarter increased to about 6300 filings up about 77 percent from
last year  i am impressed however with the regionalism in the foreclosure situation as some areas
of the nation continue to have far higher foreclosure rates than others  in contrast with the generally
positive reports in commercial real estate activity for the earlier part of 2008 recent reports have
indicated more uneven conditions in the nonresidential real estate sector across the district
turning to the national outlook i was encouraged by the recent gdp report for the second
quarter which showed growth at an annual rate of 19 percent  real final sales increased at an
annual rate of 39 percent  it now appears that the worst quarter associated with the current episode
of financial turmoil was probably the fourth quarter of 2007 when the economy abruptly stalled
the slow or nogrowth period was through the winter with the economy gradually regaining
footing through the spring and summer  if there were no further shocks i would expect the
economy to grow at a more rapid rate in the second half of this year  but there has been another
shocknamely substantial increases in commodity and energy prices  i think its important to be
careful not to confuse the effects of this latter shock with the effects of the housingsector shock
my sense is that the level of systemic risk associated with financial turmoil has fallen
dramatically  for this reason i think the fomc should begin to deemphasize systemic risk
worries  my reasoning is as follows  systemic risk means that the sudden failure of a particular
financial firm would so shock other ostensibly healthy firms in the industry that it would put them
out of business at the same time  the simultaneous departure of many firms would badly damage
the financial services industry causing a substantial decline in economic activity for the entire
economy  this story depends critically on the idea that the initial failure is sudden and unexpected
by the healthy firms in the industry  but why should this be once the crisis has been ongoing for
some time  are the firms asleep  did they not realize that they may be doing business with a firm
that may be about to default on its obligations  are they not demanding risk premiums to
compensate them for exactly this possibility  my sense is that because the turmoil has been
ongoing for some time all of the major players have made adjustments as best they can to contain
the fallout from the failure of another firm in the industry  they have done this not out of
benevolence but out of their own instincts for selfpreservation  as one of my contacts at a large
bank described it the discovery process is clearly over  i say that the level of systemic risk has
dropped dramatically and possibly to zero
let me stress that to be sure there are some financial firms that are in trouble and that may
fail in the coming months or weeks depending on how nimble their managements are at keeping
them afloat  this is why many interest rate spreads remain elevated and may be expected to remain
elevated for some time  these spreads are entirely appropriate for a financial system reacting to a
large shock  but at this point failures of certain financial firms should not be regarded as so
surprising that they will cause ostensibly healthy firms to fail along with them  the period of
substantial systemic risk has passed  of course we have also endured a bout of systemic risk
worries stemming from the operations of the gses  however my view is that the recent legislation
has addressed the systemic risk component of that situation as well  because of these
considerations my assessment is that the chances of unchecked systemic risk pushing the us
economy into a severe downturn at this point are small no larger than in ordinary times
unfortunately while the threat from this source is retreating another threat is upon us
namely a substantial shock from increased energy and certain commodities prices which is leading
many to forecast slower growth during the fall  real automotive output subtracted 11 percentage
points from real gdp growth in the second quarter  many contacts seem to attribute this largely to
consumer reaction to increased gasoline prices  if this is true then it seems to me that some of the
most visible reaction to this shock may have already occurred being pulled forward into the second
quarter
labor markets have been weak but i am not as pessimistic as most on this dimension  so
far this year the us economy has shed about 387000 nonfarm payroll jobs as compared with a
drop in employment of 402000 jobs during the first seven months of 2003 or 315000 during the
first seven months of 2002  neither of these latter two episodes is associated with the recession
label  these two years might provide better historical guides to the behavior of todays economy
than those associated with the recession label such as 2001 199091 or 198082  this is one
reason that i think the labeling game can mislead us in our thinking about the economy
the main contribution that the fomc can make to the economy is to keep inflation low and
stable  the headline cpi inflation rate is running close to 5 percent measured from one year earlier
the university of michigan survey of inflation expectations one year ahead reflects this reality with
the most recent reading at 5 percent  the june cpi annualized inflation rate was a 1970s
sounding 134 percent  of course much of this is due to energy prices  still with these kinds of
numbers were going to have to do more than talk about inflation risks  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  developments during the intermeeting
period have heightened my concern about downside risks to economic growth and slightly
allayed my concern about upside risks to inflation  let me begin with growth  the moderate
growth rate registered in the second quarter was disappointing especially because it benefited
from the temporary effects of the fiscal stimulus package  moreover the pattern of consumer
spending during the quarter with weakness in june is worrisome  with all the publicity
surrounding the rebate checks households may have put them to work earlier than usual
especially since they were facing significantly higher prices for food and gasoline  this
interpretation does not bode well for activity in the current quarter  assuming no change in the
funds rate this year we have lowered our forecast for real gdp growth for the second half of the
year about  percentage point to just  percent and project a correspondingly higher
unemployment rate
our forecast for weak secondhalf growth reflects not only the unwinding of fiscal
stimulus but also adverse financial sector developments  the credit crunch appears to have
intensified since we last met  evidence of tighter financial conditions abound  risk spreads and
the interest rates charged on a variety of private loans including mortgages are up noticeably
and lending standards have tightened further  credit losses have risen not only on mortgages but
also on auto loans credit cards and home equity lines of credit  as a consequence the list of
troubled depository institutions is growing longer  indymac and first national will not be the
last banks in our region to fail  indeed the decline in broad stock market indexes is partly a
reflection of the markets concerns about the health of the financial sector  many financial
institutions are deleveraging their balance sheets and reducing loan originations  for example a
large bank in my district has begun now in earnest to cancel or cap outstanding home equity
loans and lines of credit despite an ongoing concern about alienating consumers  tighter credit
is affecting demand  anecdotal reports suggest that the plunge in july car sales partly reflects a
tightening of credit standards for auto loans and leases  a large bank reports a substantial drop
in demand for mortgage credit in response to the recent rise in mortgage interest rates and the
anecdotal reports that we hear support the greenbooks negative view of the effect of credit
conditions on investment in nonresidential structures
the housing sector is of considerable concern  house prices have continued to fall at a
rapid rate and futures prices suggest a further decline of around 10 percent over the next 12
months  this forecast seems reasonable given the overhang of homes for sale the recent rise in
mortgage rates and the tightening of credit  unfortunately the risk of an adverse feedback loop
from tighter credit to higher unemployment to rising foreclosures to escalating financial sector
losses to yet tighter credit remains alive and well in my opinion  indeed stress tests conducted
by some of the large financial institutions in our district reveal an exceptionally high sensitivity
of credit losses to both homeprice movements and unemployment  the severe financial stress
simulation in the greenbook illustrates my concern  it is not my modal forecast but it certainly
seems well within a reasonable range of outcomes  the probability of such a scenario has risen
in my view since we met in june
one partially mitigating factor that should help to support consumer spending is the drop
in the price of oil since our last meeting  but to the extent that the decline in oil prices partly
reflects reduced expectations for global growth the net impetus from stronger domestic spending
will be offset by weaker export growth  continued declines or even stabilization in oil prices
will however be good for inflation  we have revised down slightly our forecast for core
inflation as a consequence  moreover the fact that we were not once again surprised on the
upside by oil prices has had a small favorable effect on my perception of inflation risks going
forward  that said inflation risks obviously remain  even with the recent decline energy prices
are well above yearago levels and are not only pushing up headline inflation but also spilling to
some extent into core  higher headline inflation could undermine our credibility and raise
inflation expectations  if the public concludes that our implicit inflation objective has drifted up
workers may demand higher compensation setting off a wageprice dynamic that would be
costly to unwind
fortunately the reports i hear are consistent with the view that no such dynamic has
taken hold  my contacts uniformly report that they see no signs of wage pressures  they note
that high unemployment is suppressing wage gains  growth in our two broad measures of labor
compensation are low and stable and taking productivity growth into account unit labor costs
have risen only modestly  i tend to think of the chain of causation in a wageprice spiral running
from wages to prices but it is certainly possible that the causation also or instead runs in the
opposite direction  either way though faster wage growth is an inherent part of the process by
which underlying inflation drifts up and at present we see not the slightest inkling of emerging
wage pressures
growth in unit labor costs also remains at exceptionally low levels  i would also note
that i have looked for evidence of some increase in the nairu due to sectoral reallocation by
examining the beveridge curve thinking that if there were sectoral reallocation we might see an
outward shift in the beveridge curve  i have detected no evidence of such an outward shift
these facts provide me with some comfort  moreover various measures of longerterm inflation
expectations suggest that they remain relatively well contained  when we met in june the
michigan survey of inflation expectations five to ten years ahead had recently jumped a couple
tenths of a percentage point  i argued then that the respondents to that survey typically
overrespond to contemporaneous headline inflation  since that meeting oil prices have come
down a bit and so have the michigan survey measures  assuming that the funds rate is raised
from 2 percent to 3 percent in 2009 my forecast shows both headline and core pce inflation
falling to about 2 percent in that year  so in summary during the intermeeting period my
forecast for economic growth has weakened and that for inflation has edged down slightly  i
consider the risks to our two policy objectives pretty evenly balanced at the present time
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  my outlook for economic growth and
inflation over the next few years is broadly similar to the one that i held last meeting although i
think that the prospects for both inflation and economic growth in the near term have
deteriorated since june  to a close approximation my outlook ends up looking very similar to
the greenbooks baseline scenario
the most significant change i am making to my outlook is to mark down the prospects
for business fixed investment this year and next based on the reports that i am hearing from the
manufacturers in my district  there is an interesting shorttermlongterm dynamic taking place
in the manufacturing sector  the manufacturing ceos with whom i have spoken say that over
the long term they are very bullish on america  the dollar depreciation increased transport
costs and rising wages in china all favor more usbased production  a senior executive from
alcoa told me that in his 35 years of working in the manufacturing sector he has never seen the
fundamentals point so strongly toward the united states as a profitable location for
manufacturing  the short term however presents a more mixed picture for manufacturers
although some industries such as power generation equipment and aerospace are running flat
out and expect to continue doing so companies in other manufacturing industries have received
or expect to receive order cancellations  in particular the manufacturers that supply the
automotive and commercial construction sectors are reporting a worsening outlook  perhaps the
best way to summarize the sentiments that i am hearing from manufacturers is to say that they
see a bright future but they see challenging conditions over the next 12 months
we all know that housing markets are extremely weak  housing prices began their
decline earlier in cleveland than in the rest of the country and we are now seeing some stability
in housing prices  despite that hopeful glimmer we have not seen any pickup in home sales
based on this experience it seems that we still have a long way to go nationally before we see
any pickup in residential construction
in regard to financial markets my chief concern is that lending is going to be constrained
by lenders needing to maintain sound capital ratios in the face of asset writedowns and loan
chargeoffs  balance sheet constraints and a declining risk appetite on the part of bankers mean
that some worthy borrowers are going to be rationed out of credit markets further restraining
economic activity
turning to inflation i anticipate that price pressures will intensify further before we see
some relief just as the greenbook baseline scenario depicts  manufacturers are still raising their
prices in response to rising prices for raw materials that they purchase  some companies have
had fixedprice contracts in place for five and ten years and as these contracts mature the
companies are passing on huge price increases to their customers  consequently i think that
even after a point at which energy and commodity prices flatten out prices at the wholesale and
retail levels are likely to adjust upward for a while longer
i just said that manufacturers are expecting some challenging times ahead  one reason is
that many of them are caught between weakening demand conditions and soaring input costs
sherwinwilliams represents an extreme case but i think it illustrates the situation pretty starkly
the ceo of sherwinwilliams told me last week that their business is down more than
20 percent in sales channels both to new construction and to existing homes  they have been in
business for 126 years and the last time this occurred was during the great depression  despite
these dismal sales they are having to raise prices  the ceo told me that the company typically
raises prices once a year but in july they announced their third price increase this year  in the
entire history of the company they have never before had three price increases in one year
so i continue to see the risk to my projection for output as being to the downside for the
reasons that we have been discussing for some timehigh energy prices severe financial stress
and a depression in the housing markets  the risk to my inflation outlook is weighted to the
upside because i am concerned that inflation could remain elevated for too long potentially
destabilizing inflation expectations  the greenbook baseline scenario expects the nearterm
inflation picture to worsen in the second half of this year before improving gradually over the
entire forecast period  this pattern is a concern to me  in that environment i worry that inaction
on our part before next year could be seen as complacency on our part  so when i stack up the
two risks against one another i regard them as fairly equal right now  but my outlook is
conditioned on a federal funds rate path that begins to increase about a quarter earlier than called
for in the greenbook baseline  i will speak to the relevance of this factor when we discuss
monetary policy in the next goround  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  economic conditions in the third district
remain relatively weak but they are not materially different from what we and our business
contacts have been expecting for the past several months  manufacturing and residential
construction sectors continue to show a slow decline  payroll employment in our three states fell
in june but it is still above the levels of where it was three months ago and so has been
performing somewhat better than in the nation as a whole
the pace of retail sales seems to have been softening and commercial real estate firms
indicate that most office and industrial markets have weakened slightly since the spring  my
business contacts generally expect weak growth for a while  manufacturers do expect a rebound
during the next six months but most other sectors particularly retail sales anticipate only soft or
slightly improving conditions in the near term  residential real estate is not expected to
strengthen appreciably in the second half of the year  banks expect somewhat sluggish growth
in overall lending for the rest of the year although compared with some regions banks in our
district are in pretty good shape  there are stresses but they seem to be manageable  credit
however is generally available to businesses and we hear only sporadic information from
businesses that they are unable to obtain needed loans
for some time my business contacts have expressed concern about rising energy and
commodity and transport prices  our business outlook surveys pricespaid index rose yet again
in july and it is now at its highest level since march 1980  although the pricesreceived index
edged down slightly it remains at a very very high level relative to historical standards  the
boss future pricesreceived index rose to 496 percent which is the highest level it has been
since january 1989  this indicates that roughly half the manufacturing firms that responded to
our survey expect the prices they receive for their products to be increased over the next six
months  to gauge the extent to which manufacturing firms have been able to pass on rising costs
to their customers we asked several special questions about product pricing in our july survey
more than 60 percent of our respondents indicated that since the beginning of the year they
have been able to raise prices and pass along increased costs to their customers  about
26 percent said this took the form of increases in base prices  almost half of them had increased
base prices  the rest said they have used either surcharges or escalator clauses and in some
cases combined those with base price increases as well  surcharges and escalation clauses are
not likely to go away anytime soon and may even become more widespread  about 56 percent
of our respondents indicated that price escalation clauses and surcharges are likely to be a part of
their pricing in the future  further since a large number of firms have already built cost
increases into their base prices it is not clear at all that prices will come down quickly even if
oil prices stabilize at a lower level
on the national level the incoming data since our june meeting have been mixed but
largely in line with my expectations for the nearterm path of the economy  real gdp growth
for the second quarter came in somewhat weaker than many expected although i will note that
as recently as april many people were expecting negative growth in the second quarter and it is
now almost 2 percent  but i think that the strength is a remarkable testament to the ability of this
economy to weather shocks from financial market disruptions a severe housing correction and
surges in energy and commodity prices  nonfarm payroll employment has fallen an average of
66000 jobs per month over the last seven monthsa weak number to be sure but not nearly as
severe as the job losses over the last three recessions which averaged nearly 180000 jobs a
month  since our june meeting we have taken further steps to address fragile financial markets
that were manifested by the difficulties surrounding the gses and the indymac takeover
on balance my outlook for the economy is little changed although the financial market
developments since our last meeting have marginally increased the uncertainty surrounding my
forecast  i do see nearterm weak growth for the economy but i continue to expect an
improvement in output and employment growth next year as the economy rebounds closer to
trend  unfortunately there has been a resurgence in financial market volatility especially on the
part of the banking sector and mortgage markets related to the problems of the gses  the
liquidity in the interbank and primary dealer markets appears to have improved somewhat
relative to the first quarter of this year
i read the conditions in the financial markets and the wide spreads on selected assets as
having improved somewhat on net and the spreads we are seeing increasingly reflecting real
credit risk as opposed to dysfunctional markets  as i indicated in my questions earlier we
should not use such spreads as the primary criteria for assessing the fragility of the financial
markets  moreover we must be cautious in using monetary policy or other tools at our disposal
as a form of forbearance that delays the necessary adjustments in the pricing of various financial
claims  i think we need a high hurdlethat there are real market failuresbefore we intervene
to stem liquidity desires on the part of traders or attempt to influence the price of specific asset
classes  to agree with president bullards comments we should begin to deemphasize and de
stress the importance of systemic risk because i think it is gradually dissipating as firms adjust to
the more volatile and risky environment
the current state of the financial markets seems to me to bear some resemblance to the
financial headwinds analogy that many people referred to during the early 1990s  indeed
spreads on many forms of business and consumer loans are behaving now much in the way as
they typically behave during recessionary times as credit risks rise  in the early 90s monetary
policy was less accommodative than it is nowat least the funds rate reached a low point of 3
percent from october 1992 to february 1994and during that time headline pce inflation ran
about 2 to 3 percent  the real funds rate measured by a onequarterahead forecast of the cpi
from the professional forecasters was minus 01 percent over the six quarters from 1993q3 to
1994q4  currently the real funds rate using the same measure of onequarterahead
professional forecasters cpi stands at minus 11 percent
the inflation outlook remains a cause of concern  headline inflation is higher and there
is evidence of modest passthrough to core inflation measures  inflation compensation on the
sixtotenyear horizon has risen modestly  inflation compensation at the near term has fallen
with recent declines in oil prices but it remains volatile  the staff has suggested that a portion of
the increase in the longerdated inflation compensation measures may reflect an increase in
inflation risk premiums  that is markets are uncertain about the longrun path of inflation  this
is not terribly comforting  it suggests that our credibility may be waning
despite the recent drop in oil prices i remain uncomfortable with the longerterm
inflation outlook  indeed the focus of monetary policy must be on the intermediate to longer
term and we must resist the temptation to act as if our funds rate decisions can manage the
outcomes over the very near term  yearoveryear inflation headline cpi and pce inflation
have now been consistently above 3 percent since october 1987  yearoveryear core pce
inflation has exceeded 2 percent every month but one since april 2004  that is four years
businesses are reporting an increased willingness to pass on cost increases  near term we might
get some moderation in headline inflation if the recent drop in oil prices holds  this might
result in less upward pressure on inflation expectations at least in the near term  of course as
has been pointed out oil prices are notoriously hard to predict and we may well see a resurgence
in oil prices before the years end but we dont know  more important a drop in oil prices will
only temporarily mask what i view as the underlying inflationary pressures  oil prices have
clearly exacerbated the recent numbers and may mitigate them in the near term going forward
but my concern is that the real source of intermediateterm to longerterm inflationary
pressures comes from our own accommodative policy whose consequences for inflation will be
felt only over time  we are unable to control the rise in oil prices and its consequences for
inflation in the short term but we must hold ourselves accountable for the longerterm
consequences of our choices  should we maintain our accommodative stance for too much
longer my view is that we are likely to see higher trend inflation in the intermediate term and a
ratcheting up of inflation expectations  if that scenario unfolds it will take a much more costly
policy action to reanchor those expectations than the cost of a preemptive move to raise the
funds rate in the near term
to be sure shifting policy to a less accommodative stance will be a difficult decision to
make given the continued volatility in financial markets and the projected nearterm weakness in
employment and output growth  however what has been referred to as the tail risk of a very
negative growth outcome has decreased since the start of the year whereas inflation risks have
increased  i think the enhancements we have made to our liquidity facilities should be sufficient
to address any remaining dysfunctions in the financial markets but they will not address the
credit or solvency issues nor should we expect them or desire them to do so  the markets will
have to do that admittedly heavy lifting  i do not believe that we can wait until employment
growth and the financial markets have completely turned around to begin to reverse course  but
by our aggressive attention to shortterm risk to growth and financial turmoil we do put at some
risk our ability to deliver on our intermediate and longerterm goals of both price stability and
sustainable growth  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a coffee break until 1120
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  the boston forecast used for the june
meeting expected that the unemployment rate would peak at approximately 57 percent
unfortunately with the july employment report the unemployment rate has already reached
57 percent and we expect the economy is likely to grow less than potential for the next several
quarters  with the unemployment rate rising in the past three months by 07 percentage point and
payroll employment declining for the past six months i am concerned that there remains a
significant risk that the second half of this year would look a lot like the severe financial stress or
typical recession scenarios  my concern reflects the potential impact of further deterioration
among financial institutions and financial markets that may create a significant headwind for the
economy and the likelihood that economic problems are growing in other countries which would
slow one of the few bright spots in the economyexports
since our last meeting much has been written about the problems at the gses  concern
with the viability of the gses and potential future losses has contributed to mortgage rates rising
despite our past easing the weak economy and diminished demand for mortgages  with financial
institutions showing little interest in lending to subprime or jumbo borrowers the increased cost for
individuals that qualify for conforming loans is likely to weaken the one part of the housing market
that had been relatively resilient to financial problems to date  for potential buyers higher interest
rates and the likelihood that housing prices will continue to fall provide little current incentive to
purchase a home while the job losses are providing an immediate need for some owners to sell their
homes  we need the housing market and housing prices to stabilize which i had hoped would
occur in the second half of this year but now it looks as though it will be deferred until next year
falling housing prices have created significant collateral damage  liquidity problems that
began one year ago remain in play  the capitalconstrained financial institutions that are forced to
shrink their balance sheets may pose a significant additional problem in the second half of this year
while many of the largest banks that suffered significant losses last year were able to raise
additional capital fairly readily the capital losses on newly issued bank equity may have reduced
many investors appetite for providing new capital for banks until it is clear that the economy is
recovering  the falling national housing prices and problems in commercial real estate in some
sectors of the economy are now affecting regional and community banking institutions many of
which are unlikely to get equity infusions and thus will be forced to shrink  a reduction in the
willingness to lend as represented by the senior loan officer opinion survey has often portended
a reduction in credit to bankdependent borrowers  as we get a more traditional credit crunch
compounding the liquidity problems i am concerned that credit will be less available to consumers
and businesses and further slow consumption and business investment
since the june meeting the stock market has fallen 7 percent and with the number of large
financial institutions experiencing very elevated cds spreads and stock prices in the single digits
the failure of one or more relatively large domestic or foreign financial institutions is a real
possibility  in such an environment the assumption of annual equity prices rising 7 percent in the
rest of this year and 12 percent in 2009 as assumed in the greenbook would seem to have some
significant downside risk  elevated unemployment rates and a flat or slightly falling trend in wage
and salary inflation suggest an absence of the inflationary pressures in labor markets that would lead
to rising inflation once energy and food prices stabilize
these factors give me some confidence that we will see core and total inflation in 2009
close to 2 percent  since our last meeting labor markets have been weaker than expected and oil
prices and many other commodity prices have fallen in part as a result of the concern with a
slowing global economy  although total inflation measures are clearly higher than any of us would
want these readings appear to be transitory responses to supply shocks that are not flowing through
to labor markets  in fact evidence from the labor market would seem to indicate that the downside
risks to the economy are affecting labor markets through job losses but are not creating an
environment in which labor tries to offset supply shocks with higher wage demands  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  before i begin let me add my words of
welcome to betsy duke welcoming governor duke back to the federal reserve system  i say
back because she has served excellently on our board of directors beginning almost 1 years ago
shes a fast friend and strong supporter of the federal reserve system  im delighted that the long
wait for her installation is over and i look forward to working with her but i dont want any of my
compliments to her to be detrimental to her effectiveness  laughter
the fifth district economy has remained weak in recent weeks  manufacturing and service
sector activity fell  real estate conditions remain sluggish  labor markets remain soft  export
activity remains the bright spot with reports of sustained growth in outbound cargo at district ports
in a new development however manufacturers expectations for the very near future turned
negative in our most recent survey  this is very unusual  respondents are typically relatively
optimistic about things six months from now  retail contacts indicate that the decline in sales
broadened in july in our survey and there arent many reports mentioning the effect of tax stimulus
checks  price expectations for both raw materials and final goods rose in our july survey and some
of those measures are at record highs
at the national level my outlook for real growth is broadly consistent with the greenbooks
this time  i expect sluggish growth to continue through the remainder of the year with a pickup
beginning sometime next year  housing is likely to continue to be a drag though a diminishing
one until then  consumer spending is likely to remain subdued and business investment is likely to
moderate somewhat  i expect payroll employment to continue to decline for a while at about the
current pacea pace that as others have noted is quite modest relative to what we typically see in a
recession  i think the most likely outcome is for us to continue to skirt an outright recession  i think
there is some risk of a broader and sharper contraction  i believe the magnitude of that risk is
modest but its not negligible to me  business investment could deteriorate a risk thats most
prominent in the nonresidential construction sector that we discussed earlier  but this is a small
component of aggregate demand smaller than housing and given the nature of gestation lags in this
sector i think a downturn is likely to be gradual rather than abrupt  household spending probably
poses the greatest risk to growth at this point  consumer spending has flattened out in real terms
although thats what one would expect given the increase in food and energy prices that weve seen
given the difficulty of assessing the extent to which tax rebates are propping up consumer spending
right now we do not know how much q4 consumption is going to be affected by the stimulus
rolling off
potential growth effects of credit constraints or financial headwinds have gotten a lot of
attention these days  i remain skeptical about the magnitude of the drag on consumption and
investment spending that credit market conditions are likely to create  we have of course seen
reports in the senior loan officer opinion survey of tightened credit terms but through june both
ci and consumer loans have continued to grow  i would note that we are hearing in the fifth
district concerns from some of our smaller institutions that some large banks are bidding
aggressively for depositsthis has been going on for several months now of courseand as a
result the smaller banks are paying more to fund their loans  were also hearing nowand this is a
new reportof larger banks cutting back on fed funds lending to smaller institutions no doubt out
of a concern about possible bank failures
what i think were seeing in banking markets is more of a reallocation of activity among
banks  different institutions have been affected very differently by recent events depending on the
strategies they chose to pursue in the years preceding this episode  as a consequence
intermediation is just shifting from some institutions to others  in fact weve heard of banks
picking up business that other banks are shedding  anecdotes about particular banks cutting back
on lending thus need to be taken with a grain of salt and i dont think theyre necessarily
representative of the banking sector as a whole  in fact there was a really egregious case in the new
york times of people not getting credit from banks because of this credit crunch  in paragraph 6
one is introduced to their lead anecdote  a borrower at wachovia who was denied credit  in
paragraph 22 we find out that he actually got credit two weeks later at this same institution  so im
a little skeptical about all of this anecdotal evidence about credit constraints  its undoubtedly the
case that credit standards have tightened but the environment is such that a lot of borrowers have
gotten genuinely weaker
i mention all of this just because it influences how i feel about arguments that credit market
conditions make the current level of the real funds rate any less meaningful as an indicator of the
stance of monetary policy  i just dont find those arguments convincing right now  the real funds
rate using the greenbooks forecast of overall inflation four quarters ahead is lower than it has been
at any time since the 1970s  in fact this measure is about 1 percentage points lower than the lows
it reached in 2003 or 1994 and i think this is to my mind a better way to measure the actual real
federal funds rate than whats plotted in the bluebook
the greenbook forecast is that core pce inflation will rise to 26 percent for the second half
of this year and then gradually subside to 1 percent a year or so after that  this forecast is a very
risky path i believe because at any point along that hump higher inflation could well become
embedded in expectations  i think getting back to price stability after this episode is going to
depend critically on the stability of inflation expectations as many of you have noted  it is true that
tips compensation measures have been reasonably steady for a few months and that wage rates
show no sign of accelerating as yet  but if we wait to raise rates until wage rates accelerate or tips
measures spike we will have waited too long  i think thats very clear and it will cost us too much
to recover our credibility
accordingly i believe that the biggest policy risk were going to be facing in the months
ahead is the risk of waiting too long  in past episodes of economic or financial weakness weve
been unwilling at times to raise the funds rate until we were almost completely certain that
economic recovery would be sustained  i do not think that we can afford that luxury at the present
time  the risk is too great that inflation expectations will ratchet up again  we need to be prepared
to raise rates even if growth is not back to potential and even if financial markets are not yet
tranquil and we need to be prepared to raise rates even if we think that we might have to reverse
course  after all we cut rates aggressively even though we were not certain that a recession was in
store for us and in part on the grounds that we could reverse course if it proved that we cut too far
to insist on more certainty to raise rates than to reduce them would introduce a fatal asymmetry in
our reaction function
let me add a comment or two inspired by some of the discussion around the table  i want to
commend president bullards discussion of systemic risk  you mentioned this earlier in your qa
session mr chairman  this is a notoriously slippery concept  in popular usage it seems to mean
an episode in which one bad thing happens followed by a lot of other seemingly related bad things
happening and as such its a purely empirical notion without any content or usefulness by itself as
a guide to policy  it doesnt say whether those other bad things are efficientthings that ought to
happenor inefficient and preventable by suitable policy intervention  to invoke the notion of
systemic risk to support a particular policy course requires theory  i spoke about theory last night
but it requires some theory some coherent understanding of the way you think the world works
the theoretical literature related to systemic risk is relatively young and this isnt the place to go
into it  ive said before that i think it would be useful for this committee to learn more about this
the committee might be surprised that the literature provides only relatively tenuous rationalesi
think is a fair judgmentfor policy intervention  i hope mr chairman that the group youve
commissioned to study the meaning of unusual and exigent circumstances can explore this terrain in
a little more depth  going forward i think our deliberations would be aided if we were to strive to
put our theoretical frameworks on the table when discussing how financial markets work and what
we ought to do about them
in case theres any suspense for my own moneyand this is just one mans viewi
havent seen a convincing case for the existence of policyrelevant market failures in the financial
markets in which weve intervened apart from the usual distortions owing to the federal financial
safety net  we systematically expanded that safety net  i believe what weve done has been to
subsidize selected borrower classes and prop up prices of various financial assets and i think the
problem we face now is the tremendous dependency of financial institutions and markets on our
credit  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me make just a few comments about the
greenbook forecast at this point which i found quite useful for thinking about policy going forward
only in part because it is quite close at least in broad overview to the forecast i submitted before
the june meeting on the economic outlook inflation and so forth  in any event given the alignment
in these forecasts i think there are several characteristics worth emphasizing  first financial
headwinds persistwe have talked about this for quite a whileand the greenbook now assumes
more stress and more persistence than it assumed earlier  second the inventory overhang in
housing persists with negative implications for activity and for prices in that sector  third real
growth is subdued over the next several quarters at least  against the background of the greenbook
forecast growth over the balance of this year in excess of 1 percent in real terms would have to be
considered a positive surprise  growth in excess of trend next year would have to be considered a
positive surprise  finally with regard to inflation headline inflation abates after the current quarter
although overall both headline inflation and core inflation remain above 2 percent through 2009
i realize that theres considerable uncertainty surrounding all of that and that not everybody
shares that assessment but i think its worth emphasizing those features because we need to try to
think several months and several quarters ahead in terms of the environment in which we will be
making policy decisions  if these forecasts are at least in the ballparkat the risk of perhaps
belaboring the obviousit seems to me that a major message of those forecasts is that the policy
environment is likely to remain significantly challenging for several more quarters at least  i could
put that another way  it seems that evolving readings on the economy and inflation are not likely to
line up appreciably at all with either aspect of the dual mandate over the next several quarters
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman let me say that the tenth district probably on the whole
performed a little better than the national average in the industries that we have but in terms of job
growth it has slowed  at the same time were still adding jobs in the region and our
unemployment rate remains relatively low compared with national measures  although wage
pressures actually do show some elevation relative to our beige book survey they have obviously
eased a bit in recent months  but its interesting that as we talk and monitor the labor conditions
and we talk to some of the labor unions there is a great understanding that theyre losing ground
they are going to begin entering contracts at the end of this year and in the next year and how they
approach that is extremely important because again they are looking and talking now about cost
ofliving adjustments and those sorts of things which gives me some pause  according to our
manufacturing survey our activity actually strengthened in july although the expectations for
future activity have diminished somewhat  not surprisingly manufacturers producing energy and
agriculture and in exportrelated markets continue to operate at relatively high levels whereas the
other areas within the district are showing some slowdown
let me talk just a second about oil  although oil prices have declined as was noted they
are still high enough that capital spending and production remain elevated and look to remain so in
the foreseeable future  in fact some of our industry contacts suggest that as long as expected prices
for oil remain in the 70 to 80 range there should continue to be a fair amount of investment in
that particular sector  as you well know from reading the wall street journal we did have the
semgroup go bankrupt in the tulsa area  it has had i think fairly confined effects  one of our
regional banks took some pretty heavy losses  theyre very well capitalized and did recapitalize
some of it so theyve not been dramatically affected by it  local producers are in the worst bind
because they havent been paid for some of the oil delivered and theres no other party to contract
with for future deliveries  so that has brought a lot of uncertainty in the local area about where to
provide some of this oil that theyre producing
in my discussions with businesses around the district its interesting that theres a lot more
conversation about and focus on managing your price strategy in this environment  as has been
true for a while fuel surcharges are prevalent and firms are able to pass those along with a fair
amount of ease  in addition businesses are reporting that materials suppliers are placing 10day to
30day time limits on their price quotes  finally most price indexes in our manufacturing survey
remain near historically high levels and plans for future passthroughs have actually intensified
turning to the national outlook my outlook for growth has not changed materially since the
last meeting  i expect that growth will slow in the second half because of these higher energy
prices some weakness in the labor market and sluggish activity in some of the manufacturing
sectors  the fact is that the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook is considerable and
downside risk to growth in the nearterm future is there  these risks are being addressed from our
perspective by our current stance of accommodative monetary policy  so we are addressing that
uncertainty  the point i would like to make is that im less uncertain about the outlook for core
inflation  we have seen erosion in longerterm inflation expectations and i believe inflation risks
have actually risen  if core inflation rises in the second half as expected there is a real possibility
that inflation expectations will become unanchored especially if we maintain our current
accommodative stance of policy  an expected levelingoff of food and energy prices and slack in
the economy could help moderate upward pressure on inflation but i do not think they will be
enough to actually bring inflation down to an acceptable level  in fact if we maintain the funds rate
at 2 percent i think inflation is more likely to move higher than lower over the medium term and
that concerns me  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  like the greenbook our
modal forecast shows weaker real activity and slightly higher core inflation over the forecast period
downside risks to growth remain substantial in my view and have probably increased relative to
what we thought in june  risks on the inflation front remain weighted to the upside perhaps
somewhat less than in june but this is hard to know with confidence  the adverse growth risks are
worse for several reasons  the labor market and labor income are weakening more quickly than
expected  although there were some tentative signs of stabilization of housing demand in the
spring demand seems to have fallen further since  credit conditions are tighter and are expected to
be tighter longer and this seems likely to produce a further deterioration in overall demandnote
of course the reduction in credit for autos the rise in mortgage rates and the more conservative
lending standards for consumer and corporate credit  growth outside the united states seems likely
to slow further  of course fundamental to this dynamic as has been true for 12 months each shift
in perceptions that the bottom in overall economic growth is further away produces additional stress
for financial institutions and markets adding to the intensity of prospective financial headwinds and
to concerns about downside risks to growth
now the adverse tail on the inflation front remains significant  many measures of
underlying inflation suggest a broadbased if limited to date acceleration in the rate of underlying
inflation  market and surveybased measures of longterm expectations are high  surveys suggest
that firms are able to pass on some part of the acceleration in energy and materials costs  on the
more positive side energy commodity and materials prices have declined significantly principally
it seems because of expectations of slower growth in global demand  growth is moderating
significantly around the world and its going to have to moderate further in the most populous parts
of the world as central banks there get monetary policy tighter
the growth of unit labor costs has been and is expected to be very moderate here  profit
margins still show plenty of room to absorb cost increases and as david reminded us you can have
a relatively benign outlook for the path of core inflation without margins narrowing very
dramatically  inflation expectations have not deteriorated meaningfully here even with the flatter
expected path of monetary policy in the united states  of course its very important that inflation
expectations and pricing power moderate from current levels  if some of the downside risks to
growth materialize this will happen and inflation risks will moderate  if however the economy
continues to prove to be resilient to these downside risks then we will face higher inflation  on
balance the rate of growth in underlying inflation suggests that growth in demand in the united
states will have to be below potential for a longer period of time if inflation expectations are to
come down sufficiently  this means that we will have to tighten monetary policy relatively soon
compared with our previous behavior in recoveriesperhaps before we see the actual bottom in
house prices and the actual peak in unemployment
however at this point the risks to real growth remain critical  in my view we need to have
more confidence that we have substantially reduced the risks of a much sharper more protracted
decline in growth before we begin to tighten  i think it is unlikely that we will be able or will need
to move before early next year  shortterm market expectations for monetary policy in the united
states seem about right at present  i dont see a strong case for trying to alter those expectations in
either direction at this point  to try to pull forward the expected tightening would risk adding to the
downside risk to growth and magnifying the risk of a much more severe financial crisis  on the
other hand if we avoid some of these downside risks to growth then policy will need to tighten
more quickly perhaps than the expected path now priced in the markets
the evolution of monetary policy expectations and of inflation expectations since may
illustrates how uncertain the markets are about what path of policy will be appropriate  but the
pattern of changes in both of these measures of expectations suggests that the markets believe we
will get this balance rightthat we will do enough soon enough to keep underlying inflation
expectations from eroding materially  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like others around the table i made only small
revisions to the central tendency of my forecast going forward as a result of the developments of the
intermeeting period maybe a slight reduction in the path of output and a quicker decline in headline
inflation owing to the oil prices  but i think more important than any shift in central tendencies is
the sense that the information tends to reinforceto reduce the uncertainties aroundthe basic
contours of a projection in which the economy operates with a wider output gap and a lower
inflation rate on balance over the next 18 months or so than it has over recent quarters
about the output gap the incoming information strongly suggests that we are on a trajectory
that at least for some time will have the economy growing appreciably below the growth rate of its
potential  the most obvious evidence is the persistence of a soft labor marketcontinuing declines
in employment and no sign of nearterm strengthening in the initial claims data  i agree that the
declines in employment as several of you have pointed out are not consistent with a recession but
theyre certainly not consistent with the economy growing close to its potential  you need another
150000 or 200000 jobs rather than minus 60000 which is where we are now  so i think the
economy is likely to grow below potential for some time
even on the spending side the decline in consumption in june when rebate checks were
continuing to hit bank accounts and a further sharp drop in auto sales in july might be early signs
that households are beginning to pull back under pressure from higher energy prices job worries
declining house values and reduced credit availability  to be sure one months consumption data
along with auto sales which are subject to all kinds of idiosyncratic influences are not enough to
justify a major change in outlook  but as president lacker noted household spending has for some
time been a source of downside risk to the forecast  at some point household spending could begin
to reflect attitudes and this information at a minimum seems to underline those risks as well as to
point to sluggish growth of spending in the third quarter
soggy economic news has extended to our trading partners where actual activity and
expected activity also have been marked down  the tone of news from abroad has been decidedly
downbeat as those economies feel the effect of weaker purchases from the united states
continuing financial strain softening housing markets and higher energy prices  much as in the
united states attitudes abroad seem weaker than the data but the euro area did report a record
decline in retail sales in june this morning and my sense is that our trading partners are facing
larger downside risks to growth as well as a markdown of central tendencies  the dollar hasnt
changed much on balance for four or five months now  with a stable dollar and weaker demand
abroad production in the united states will be getting a lot less cushion from net exports over the
next few quarters than it did in the first half of the year
finally despite the downward movement in treasury interest rates and in the expected
federal funds rate path financial conditions for households and businesses have tightened since the
last fomc meeting  savers and intermediaries have become even more cautious amid concerns
about deepening losses spreading beyond subprime mortgages about the safety of uninsured
deposits at regional banks high volatility in markets and the possible weakening of the underlying
macro situation  lenders are hunkering down to endure a long period of rising credit problems and
great uncertainty  i dont think we need to rely on anecdotes here  mortgage interest rates have
actually risen on balance as have corporate bond yields across many risk categories and in many of
these cases the nominal interest rates are at least as high as or in some cases much higher than they
were last august when the federal funds rate was at 5  banks continue to tighten terms and
standards for nearly all categories of loans  equity prices have fallen adding to the downward
pressure on wealth from declining house prices and i think these developments underscore the very
slow recovery likely in financial markets and the possible downside risks relative to even that very
gradual improvement that many of us were expecting  the tightening of conditions is damping
credit growth broadly defined and will constrain at least to some extent spending going forward
delaying the return to trend or abovetrend growth
thus although uncertainties remain quite elevated i think we can be a little more confident
that the economy will be subject to further quarters of belowtrend growth and declining resource
utilization  furthermore with housing prices still falling fast inventories of homes still high and
financial markets quite skittish the downside risks even to a slightly lower central tendency forecast
remain high  greater confidence that output will grow below potential for a time contributes to a
little more optimism on my part that inflation will indeed come down substantially over the
coming quarters  an environment of rising unemployment and declining capacity utilization is not
one in which businesses or labor will find it easy to restore real incomes or raise profit margins after
the increase in energy prices
with regard to that increase in energy and other commodity prices and how it affects
headline inflation i like to differentiate passthrough from spillover  i think we can expect pass
through  passthrough to consumer prices of the higher energy and commodity prices is part of the
adjustment process by which demand gets damped and by which consumers realize unfortunately
the lower real income that they get from the adverse terms of trade  so the fact that businesses are
able to pass through higher commodity prices and higher petroleum prices i dont find all that
worrisome provided that theyre passing through a onetime increase in prices rather than a
continuing rise  i think we have some further evidence that at least to datethings could change i
admitwhat we are seeing is a passthrough of a onetime rise rather than some continuing
increases  for one thing commodity prices as shown in bills chart have flattened out or actually
declined in the past few months  so presumably that passthrough is a onetime jump if thats what
theyre doing passing through those prices  second i think we saw in the gdp chaintype price
indexes that the price of domestic value added increased at an annual rate of only 11 percent in the
second quarterwhich suggests to me that at least through the second quarter there was very little
spillover from these higher commodity and energy prices to the stuff we produce here at home
also labor compensation growth which could be a lagging indicator at least to date hasnt
increased  if anything it has slowed a little further which along with relatively robust productivity
growth is holding down unit labor costs  headline inflationthe goods and services that people
purchasehas been high  energy prices are being passed through but i think to date theres no
evidence or very little evidence that its spilling over into other prices in the economy  so this is
about the adjustment to relative prices  obviously the decline in oil prices if it holds will be
helpful on the inflation front both in its direct effect on headline inflation and its indirect effect on
inflation expectations  we finally have evidence of twoway risk in oil prices and that should make
us more comfortable with an assumption of stable prices as a reasonable basis for forecasting
other recent contributors to higher price levels have also become less averse  as i mentioned other
industrial commodity prices have leveled out or declined and the dollar has been relatively stable in
recent months
although i feel a little more confident about the expectation of lower inflation going
forward i agree that upside risks still prevail  core inflation has ticked up  headline inflation will
be high for some time and could threaten to spill over through increases in inflation expectations
oil and commodity price declines are largely an endogenous response to perceptions of weak
growth and if those perceptions turn around so will those prices  longerterm inflation
expectations remain elevated by some measures and are probably less well anchored than they were
a couple of years ago before oil and commodity prices rose so much  in sum i see upside risks to
both the inflation gaps and the output gaps as having diminished over the intermeeting period and
well get to the implications of that for policy in the next part of the meeting
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i have no material changes to report in my view
on the overall state of financial stability growth or inflation but as i talked about at the last
meeting it still is likely to be a long hot summer and were only about half over with it  ill talk
first about financial institutionsmake maybe four or five pointsand then turn quickly to the
economy and inflation
first on financial institutions i think the body blow that the financial markets and the real
economy have taken because of the turmoil at the gses is not complete  it is easy for those of us in
washington to forget that bill signings dont always solve problems  id say if the last thing that
happens on gses is that the bill was signed two weeks ago and action isnt taken in the coming
weeks and months then i would be surprised if we could get through this period without more gse
turmoil finding its way onto the front pages  second in terms of financial market conditions the
fall in oil prices and the rest of the energy complex is indeed good news but it strikes me that it has
camouflaged an even tougher period for financial institutions than would otherwise be the case
that is financial institutions somehow look a little more resilient but i think part of that is only
because of the negative correlation thats developed in recent times between equity prices of
financials and oil prices  the financial institutions themselves strike me as being in worse condition
than market prices would suggest
third capital raising as we have long talked about is essential to the fix among financial
institutions  the way i best describe capital raising over maybe the last nine months is that the first
round of capital raising which was in november and december was really the vanity round  this
consisted of very limited due diligence sovereign wealth funds signing up issuers relying upon
their vaunted global brands and capital being raised in a matter of days  the second round
probably took us to the spring a round that id call the confessional round  laughter  in this
round financial institutions said oh my look at these real writedowns that i have  look at the
need for this real capital raising and here im telling you the investors all that i know  but the
second and third confessions usually have less credibility than the first  the third round is the round
that were in the middle of which i think of as the liquidation and recap round likely to be the
hardest round to pull off  it is likely to force issuers of new shares or of new forms of preferred
stock to be asking of themselves and their investors the toughest choices  they have to assess the
strength and durability of their core franchises  i think that this will be happening in very real time
so the circumstance of an investment bank that bill mentioned at the outset i dont think will be the
sole case of this  this liquidation and recap round is later than would be ideal from the perspective
of the broader economy but it is absolutely needed  until we see how it occurs its hard for me to
be much more sanguine that the capital markets or the credit markets will be returning to anything
like normal anytime soon
let me make a fourth broad point about financial institutions  because of these different
phases of capital raise i think management credibility among financial institutions is at least as
suspect as it has ever been during this period  even new management teams that have come in have
in some ways used up a lot of their credibility  it would be nice to believe that they have taken all
actions necessary to protect their franchises and their businesses but most stakeholders are skeptical
that theyve taken significant or sufficient action  at the end of the day no matter where policy
comes out in terms of regulatory policy from the fed and other bank regulators or accounting policy
from the sec or fasb it strikes me that those changes in policy are less determinative of how
things shake out  that is management credibility is so in question that the cure is not likely to come
from accounting rules or regulators but from the markets believing that what management says is
what management believes and will act on it  as a result i think that many of these financial
institutions are operating in a zerodefect world which is posing risks to the real economy
fifth let me make a final point about financials  weve all talked a lot about the effect of
different curves for housing prices on the financial institutions themselves  i dont mean to give
short shrift to any of that but i would say that the level of uncertainty and associated risks of their
nonhousingrelated assets are now very much a focus  according to july 2008 data of credit
currently being extended by banks only about 20 percent is for residential real estate  only about 9
percent is for consumer credit  so that leaves the balance in areas where these financial institutions
and their management teams have to be asking themselves whether the weaknesses that are
emerging in the real economy will place uncertainty over assets that have nothing to do with
housing  thats a major downside risk for financial institutions and has not been much of a focus of
shareholder and stakeholder concerns
there are two open issues that will guide some of our thinking at least with respect to these
credit markets  first as we talked about a little last night with the presidents are the embedded
losses so great at such a critical mass of institutions with management credibility so low that many
more than currently expected might be unable to survive  this is a question that im not sure i
know the answer to  second despite the concerns about the effect of the credit markets on the
broader economy that i talked about our monetary policy may not be terribly well suited to be
fixing those problems and financial institutions may not be terribly sensitive to the extent we decide
that we should change the stance of policy
taking all that into account let me say a couple of words about growth and inflation  first
on the economic growth front given my views of whats happening in the credit markets its very
hard for me to believe that the economy will get back to potential anytime soon  there are
continued financial stresses that could last through yearend and in there could be an upside
surprise  still all things considered my base case has secondhalf growth still above staff estimates
owing in part to the productivity weve seen in recent months and the remarkable resiliency of this
economy  if we look beyond that horizon though toward the greenbook forecast in 2009 and
beyond i must say i dont really see the inflection point to take us back to economic growth of
22 percent or whatever the greenbook suggests  i think were going to be in this period of below
trend growth for quite some time  my own view is that when the congress comes back after its
august recess we will be in the middle of a big debate on son of stimulus and that the stimulus
probabilities have moved up quite materially  however it is not at all obvious to me that it will do
much in terms of helping the real economy  outside the united states i share the view of governor
kohn which is that id expect global gdp particularly gdp among advanced foreign economies
our major trading partners to continue to disappoint making the remarkable addition of net export
growth to our own gdp likely to dissipate
turning finally to inflation my view is that inflation risks are very real and i believe that
these risks are higher than growth risks  i dont take that much comfort from the move in
commodity prices since we last met  if that trend continues then that would certainly be good
news but i must say i dont feel as though inflation risks have moved down noticeably since we last
had this discussion  the staff expects food prices to continue to be challenging that is certainly my
view  the staff also expects core import prices to fall rather precipitously  im a little skeptical of
that view  i think its possible but i dont really see the catalyst for that given what we see about
changes in input prices overseas and given expectations of the dollar in foreign exchange markets
so with that i think that the inflation risks are real and ill save the balance of my remarks for the
next round  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  we have now had the first anniversary of all
the financial turmoil and how have the markets celebrated  well we have had freddie and
fannie go down and need one of the largest bailouts  we have had indymac go downthe
second largest bank failure in us history and perhaps the most costly bank failure in us
history  i am talking just in nominal terms i havent actually done the real adjustments  also
weve seen a variety of widening risk spreads  at the last meeting i went on with my standard
metaphor of the slow burn and said that things could reignite and i think we certainly have seen
a few things reignite  i very much agree with governor warsh with respect to freddie mac and
fannie mae that although legislation has been passed the devil will be in the implementation
details  simply because the treasury has the capacity to do something it is not quite clear what
it will do or be able to do or how the markets will respond to that  obviously freddie and
fannie have been really the only game in town for mortgage securitization  the jumbo markets
have not been working  the subprime market is not there right now  so until and unless we can
be assured that they will operate properly they still have a lot of potential for more flames
coming out
there are also a number of other reasons that i am still concerned about financial markets
being very far from normal  one reference was made to a study that we have done here at the
board that nellie liang is taking the lead on  new york has also done a study i think they used
very different methods but came out with similar numbers  the studies say that large losses are
still to come and that total losses associated with the challenges that we have been seeing will be
on the order of 900 billion  us and european financial institutions have taken about
400 billion of writedowns  not all of those losses will be on financial institutions balance
sheets but there certainly are potentially more losses to comenot only in mortgages in
leveraged loans and in commercial real estate but also in the consumer parts of the portfolio and
potentially other parts of the portfolio  a fragility is there which has to be taken into account
when we look at capital ratios  if you simply look at reported capital ratios they are off their
peaks of a few years ago  however if you were to do a morethorough marktomarket on a lot
of different pieces of the portfolio or if you did have to liquidateeven assuming it wasnt a
broad fire sale but just one institution that had to liquidate now and it had no further
consequences for anyone elses expectations which i dont think is accurateyou would see
those capital ratios be in fact much much thinner than they appear in an accounting sense
a number of people talked about the ois spreads and said that things seem to be at
50 basis points rather than at 10 basis points  well that is true not only in the us dollar but
also in the euro and in sterling  if you look to the forward market that number is increasing  it
is not staying the same  it is going up quite a bit to about 75 basis points over a year period for
the dollar to 130 to 150 basis points in sterling and in euro  that suggests a lot more challenges
to come  so even if 50 is the new 10 it is still a major challenge going forward  that puts a lot
of pressure on banks to generate earnings to make up for the writedowns and other challenges
in the old days when you could finance yourself at 10 basis points the institutions were
undertaking a lot of activities that would allow them to generate a lot of revenue even if they
kept taking hits in certain parts of their portfolio  but when funding is at 5 times that or 10
times that or 15 times that a lot of activities that once were profitable are not profitable  the
margins are much lower and their ability to earn their way out of this is much much more of a
challenge  i think that is going to be even truer for the european institutions  that is actually
one area in which i see it as more likely that an important shoe might drop not just in the united
states but in a major european institution  european institutions havent been as active in raising
capital and there are more constraints on their ability to raise capital given the way rights issues
work  i think that greater challenges are going to come in the european economies and that the
ecb faces greater challenges in dealing with the increasing inflation threat that they have there
and worldwide while being able to provide some policy accommodation
third securitization markets have certainly not recovered  we have talked about that
the infrastructure investment that will be needed for these to come back in terms of data
contract certainty et cetera is going to take a long long time  it is not clear exactly how long
but it is clear that recovery will not be right around the corner  that means continuing pressure
on banks balance sheets independent of all the other capital issues  if they just want to continue
on they have to keep a lot of things on their balance sheets  one bright light just in case you see
nothing positive is that we were able to put off some very significant changes in accounting
fas 140 and fin 46r  they were on a very fast track to make changes that could have
brought literally trillions of dollars of assets back onto balance sheets and would have made it
extremely difficult for securitization markets to work  that has been significantly delayed and i
think they will take a more balanced and measured approach  not only has that been put off but
also the institutions will have more time to deal with it  but this pressure is real  the senior
loan officer opinion survey couldnt be more crystal clear on the challenges that are there and
that are likely to continue to be there  why is that  well as a number of people have
mentioned it is because of challenges on the heloc portfolios and on the option arm
portfolios and uncertainty about a lot of other pieces of the portfolios  so given my views i am
really glad that the greenbook baseline has taken on board much more of what was previously a
delayed recovery alternative simulation scenario much in line with what president stern
mentioned
but i continue to see that the situation is quite brittle and that small pressures potentially
can lead to large and rapid responses  the severe financial stress alternative simulation in the
greenbook is certainly not my central tendency one but i think that we cant dismiss it too easily
because there still could be anotherwhat i have now taken to calling since i chair the
supervision and regulation committeeflareup with one of my problem children  many of you
know the problems in your districts but there are a lot of problems unfortunately in all the
districts and around the world  i hope no one will ever hear about the problems that my children
are having but sometimes they do come out  as governor warsh said one way to try to deal
with those is through capital  it is becoming increasingly difficult to do that  in the old days the
accounting rules were such that you could take over an institution through socalled pooling
accounting methods so you would not face an immediate writedown of everything to current
market values  one challenge we have with the institutions that are likely to be failing over time
is that these accounting standards are no longer available so it is very very difficult to use the
kinds of methods that have been used in the past by the fdic and other regulators to avoid the
indymac type of problems  it is quite possible that we will be seeing more people queuing up
and more people pulling money out of accounts even though they are insured accounts  there
has certainly not been a generalized drain from the banking system  there has been a recent
shuffling as president lacker said  but it also makes a lot of institutions much much more
vulnerable than they have been in the past
if you look at the severe financial stress scenario in the greenbook what is interesting
about it is that it is relatively benign  for something that is severe stress the macroeconomic
outcomes in terms of gdp and unemployment arent that severe because of the policy
responsetaking the federal funds rate down to  percent  i dont think we can possibly do that
in the current environment  it is not that i think that inflation expectations have become
unanchored or are not contained but i do think that our policy responses are contained precisely
because we cant quite go there  if you look at the inflationary spiral scenario it says that by
2009 the fed funds rate would have to go up to 3 percent  i dont think we are in that or
anywhere close to that  but if we had to respond as the greenbook said to bring the fed funds
rate down below 1 percent i think we would get close to that and we would be in a very very
difficult position
we have to be very careful about inflation expectations  i think we have mixed evidence
on inflation expectations and inflation although i am heartened that things do not seem to have
become unanchored  some of both the marketbased measures and the surveybased measures
have come down a bit although i think as governor kohn said that the situation is much more
fragile  i dont want to take on board too much comfort from the change in commodity prices
because we have seen temporary movements up and we have seen temporary movements down
it is heartening but i think we have to still be very very careful on this issue  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin your swan song
laughter
mr mishkin  well i get one more chance in the policy round  that is the one i am
going to really go for  i am sure that people are waiting for it  laughter  my modal forecast
has not changed appreciably  clearly i am very concerned about the headwinds as a result of
the difficulty in recapitalizing financial institutions which governor warsh talked a lot about
as a result i think that we are going to have subpotential growth for quite a period of time
however the bigger concern is that i see downside risks as having risen substantially  so
let me first talk about the things that are the less worrisome downside risks  i think there are
increased downside risks just on the real side of the economy  in particular the consumer has
been very resilient but i am not as sure that that will be true in the future  we just saw terrible
auto sales  it could be just one month and it could bounce back up  but it could be a precursor
to much bigger problems which would not be completely surprising given some of the other
things going on with housing prices and credit restrictions  that is one downside risk  the
second is that european growth may have shifted down and so the kind of problems that we are
experiencing here perhaps are being experienced there particularly in terms of lower housing
prices in some parts of the euro zone  that could mean less demand for our exports and it
would be another negative for economic activity  the third is that we have actually seen a
backup in mortgage rates and that can have a direct effect on housing demand  it is pretty grim
when you look at what is going on in terms of housing starts but it could get worse  it cant go
below zero but it could get worse
so if that were all there was i would say that there may be a little increase in downside
risk but it wouldnt frighten me  but i really am very worried about the potential downside risks
in the financial sector  i have to disagree very strenuously with the view that because you have
been in a financial stress situation for a period of time there is no potential for systemic risk
in fact i would argue that the opposite can be the case  just as a reminder remember that in the
great depression wheni cant use the expression because it would be in the transcripts but
you know what im thinkingsomething hit the fan laughter it actually occurred close to a
year after the initial negative shock  in this particular environment we have to think about
where we started  we were very lucky that this financial disruption occurred when bank balance
sheets actually were in very good shape initially  you know thank our lucky stars that it
happened at that point
we are now a year into this  bank balance sheets do not look very good for all the
reasons that we have been discussing  in fact they look pretty grim  we have had some failures
and we are concerned about other failures  so we have a very different environment  in that
situation if a shoe dropsand we have had big shoes dropping we had bear stearns we had the
gses and we had smaller cases like indymacand if financial systems are in a very weakened
state really bad things could happen  i think that there really is a serious danger here  in
particular we could have a dynamic through a decline in demand for housing because of the
backup in mortgage rates or other reasons lowering housing prices and that spilling over into the
financial system in terms of raising credit spreads which then lowers demand and we could get
a nasty vicious spiral  it is exactly one of these adverse feedback loops that we are all concerned
about  so this is not off the table and it very much worries me  i will talk about the implications
of that for policy later
on the inflation front although i definitely see upside risks i think they may have
diminished just a smidgen  there is a question about how large those upside risks are  in terms
of my thinking about what drives the inflation process it is expectations about future output gaps
and expectations about inflation over a long period not a shortterm period  i see absolutely no
evidence that in the last couple of months we have had deterioration in longterm inflation
expectations  if anything they have gotten a little better since march  if you look at the
numbersand bill had it in his picturebasically there was some ratcheting up when the crisis
first hit  i would argue a lot of that had to do with inflation risk because there really was
increasing inflation risk  there has been a slight movement upmaybe a tenth maybe you
could say twotenthsin expectations when you look at forecasters
i am very skeptical of consumer surveys because exactly what behavioral economics
tells us there is framing  if headline inflation is high shortterm inflation expectations go up
which should happen but longterm inflation expectations also go up  when headline goes
down then they will come down  there was a nice little article from the san francisco fed in
one of those little letter deals on exactly this issue which came up with exactly this conclusion  i
recommend that you read it and the good news is that it takes only four minutes to read because
the articles are meant to be very short  so i really do not see that there has been deterioration
andi think that this is very importantit is why i stressed the issue of the analytic framework
for thinking about the inflation process and what monetary policy can do  we cant control
relative prices but we can do something about longrun inflation expectations and expectations
about future output gaps
so i havent seen a problem lately that there has been deterioration in longrun
expectations  what about output gaps  well if anything they look as though they are expected
to widen maybe a smidgen not that much  we dont have any indication to expect that we will
be overshooting in terms of having output greater than potential  again that should not be
raising inflation  it should if anything maybe lower it a bit  finally of course oil prices are
lower  i dont think that means that they will stay low because the volatility is huge but at least
the fear that they are going to keep on going up and up and upso it would not be a oneshot
change but would be put into longrun inflationhas i think diminished somewhat
so where do i stand in terms of the upside risk  there still is upside risk because having
high headline inflation does have the potential to spill over into inflation expectations  all of us
have that concern  but i want to emphasize very strongly that it has not happened yet i think
that is very important  i also think it is very important to monitor this  one concern that
members of the committee have is that we wouldnt react fast enough because we have
sometimes been inertial in the past  that is a serious concern  but i think there is a strong
argument that when you have very big downside risks to economic activity you want to deal
with inflation expectations when they actually indicate that there is some problem  and i just do
not see that at this juncture  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i was advised to speak of things i know so all
of my comments will have to do with commercial banks and the traditional banking operations
within those banks  also they are limited to the market area that i operated in  i was in a large
community bank  the primary competitors were 2 of the top 5 banks and 4 of the top 20 banks
i hope to expand that on the supervision committee
i guess the major observation i would have is that i cant see lending growth ever
resuming until the market for financial stocks improves  that market is not going to improve
until it is clear that the credit risk is manageable  i havent seen the confidence in banking and
banking institutions this low since we were well into the sl crisis back in the early 1990s  at
the same time the credit numbersor at least the commercial banks part of the credit
numbersdont look all that bad  at this point we are sharing those credit losses with a number
of other types of institutions and i think the banks got the better slice of that pie  so i do believe
that the banks will be able to manage through this
on the equity side of things you have had equity destroyed through credit losses and so
those banks are certainly reducing their lending  i dont think there is enough capital in the
system  i dont think earnings are strong enough  there is certainly no external capital available
to pick up that slack  so while you hear smaller banks say we are getting great business now
because the larger banks have cut back on their lending they just dont have the capacity to take
in that business  no matter why they are trying to raise capital capital issuance is viewed as a
sign of weakness  it is scarce  it is expensive  the short selling has been just amazing  it has
really driven down the prices  for some of the larger banks it is running anywhere from 10 to
15 percent of total float  it has even gotten down into banks smaller than 5 billion  i was
looking at one and the short interest on july 15 was 10 times that of april 15  it was running
about 7 percent of float on a very thinly traded stock  i cant believe that it has anything to do
with the fundamentals of the institution  it is just all being painted with the same brush
for institutions that must raise capital or fail my concern is that the capital that is being
raised or being offered comes with an exit strategy  i dont think that the capital is going to have
the patience to wait for a longerterm resumption of lending  those that do have capital cushions
seem to be spending them on small buybacks or dividend increases in an effort to demonstrate
some confidence in the future
on the liquidity side central core funding is very tight and incredibly uncertain  cd
rates do remain high and as one institution after another desperately needs money they raise the
rates  as one falls out of that situation somebody else picks it up again  after the full weekend
of indymac coverage in the press the phones just lit up everywhere asking about fdic
insurance  now there is a renewed interest in the cdars program  i didnt realize that these
deposits are classified as brokered deposits  it will be interesting to see if we have a big jump in
brokered deposits in the next couple of quarters  the home loan banks are tightening their
collateral requirements  they are introducing risk rating systems so that source of funding is not
as available as it was  nonconforming mortgages are impossible to place
on the asset side i talked to several correspondent bankers and they have been told to
cut their overall fed funds lines sometimes in half  it doesnt matter who it is just cut them in
half  a number of the banks are cutting home equity lines across the board and freezing those
lines  the fullrelationship lending is prized but even in that it is only to the extent that lending
is in some ways self funding  transaction deals are like hot potatoes nobody wants to touch
them
we had some calls from other bankers who were asking what liquidity premium we were
adding to our pricing so there is clearly a change in the pricing which may actually improve
profitability  however i think a lot of it is in order not to turn down the credit but simply to
price out the credit so that the borrower makes the decision not to borrow rather than the bank
making the decision not to lend
on the credit side the reserve additions have been incredibly dramatic but a lot of that is
because reserve levels were so low going into this  capital was strong earnings were strong but
reserve levels were down at 70 or 80 basis points  i had not ever seen them below 1 percent until
two or three years ago  that is because of the change in the accounting for reserves as well as 10
years of no demonstrable losses  oddly enough the chargeoff and delinquency rates really
dont look all that bad  when i looked at firstquarter rates they didnt look a whole lot different
from what used to be the norm at least in terms of commercial loans  then on the consumer
side in this case it was mortgage loans versus consumer loans but still a 75 basis point loss on
consumer loans historically was actually normal
it is really difficult to follow any discussion of what is going on in terms of credit losses
because you get confused between what is marktomarket loss what is actual credit loss what
are chargeoffs what are reserves and then who owns those losses  i am not quite sure what the
rate of deterioration or the rate of resolution is  in terms of collection it takes an awful lot of
time to ramp up collection and recovery efforts and i dont know where we are in that cycle but
i think we have a long way to go
the last cycle was all about commercial real estate and nobody could work up much
sympathy for commercial real estate developers  laughter  in this situation there is so much
political sensitivity around foreclosures that i think it is going to be much elongated  when a
borrower cannot or will not pay and you cant restructure it to create capacity or willingness to
pay then some form of forced sale is the only thing that gets you off go  i think that has been
pushed out and pushed out  it is also the only way to clear any junior liens  this process is
expensive and timeconsuming and owning the property is even more expensive  so as the
lenderowned properties become a larger and larger segment of the properties for sale i do think
price declines are going to accelerate significantly
i will be watching the indymac resolution particularly closely  in the last cycle if you
will remember the properties that were sold by the rtc brought the biggest discounts of all  so
it will be interesting to see what this theory of holding off on foreclosures and then at some later
point having to move the assets actually does to prices  the good news is that once lenders start
selling they do tend to move units at whatever price it takes  lenders are going to have to do
that  there is no justification for wasting precious capital or liquidity on dead assets  but there
is also no justification for selling the portfolios at fire sale prices if the net realizable value of
collecting them is higher and i think it definitely is for the banks
finally if i could take one more minute i did do some very indepth personal research on
the housing decisions of a relocating worker  laughter  i purchased a residence in january 06
for a may 06 closing and hit the peak  the current value i am told is 80 to 85 percent of the
purchase price marketing time 6 to 12 months  the purchase in the new locationi did do the
calculationit was 15 to 20 times annual rent but that didnt matter  i had already had all the
thrill of ownership that i could stand and will be renting  laughter  the second thing is that if
i had financed this property at 80 percent i would have had no equity to roll into a new purchase
anyway so there would have been no decision involved  the good news is that as long as there
is no need to sell the price doesnt matter and i could have waited it out very easily  so the
conclusion that i came to is that this current elevated inventory we have of housing includes only
those who absolutely have to sell because nobody in this market would choose to sell  so once
that begins to turn around again there just have to be a whole lot of pentup houses for sale
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  michelle what time is our hard cutoff here
ms smith  we can be pretty flexible  were okay
chairman bernanke  you want it before 215 though  all right  well i spent a
lot of time through the meeting and during the break working up a crystalline summary of the
discussion  laughter  but i am a bit concerned about getting to lunch and avoiding the 215
hard deadline so if you would excuse me this time i will just go directly to a few comments of
my own and then we can go to the policy round
we saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter which suggests a campaign
slogan for the republicans the economy  it could be worse  laughter  the question
though is whether this higherthanexpected growth rate in the second quarter implies that we
are actually looking forward to a betterthanexpected remainder of the year or whether this was
in some sense a last hurrah of borrowing from the future  i feel that i am very strongly in the
latter camp unfortunately  i do think that for reasons people have talked about the remainder of
the year and into next year are likely to be quite weak  i dont know how weak but if you look
at each component of spending or component of production you see mostly very negative
indicators
we have talked about consumption  we know about all the fundamental issues that are
affecting consumers and we have seen recently i think both anecdotally and in terms of the
data some softness particularly in the auto area  in the labor market several people have noted
that the loss of payroll jobs has not been as rapid as for example in 2001  the unemployment
rate though has risen as quickly as in previous episodes and any look at the unemployment rate
would suggest that this is something close to a normal recession dynamic
housing of course remains very uncertain  we dont really know when the bottom will
be although i would add a point that i think bill dudley made that there seems to be a growing
confidence that when we have reached the bottom in housing whenever that may be we will see
a very quick improvement both in the financial markets and then presumably in the economy
as well  in other areas such as nonresidential construction architectural billings and other
factors suggest slowing there  we see slowing in the other industrial countries although some
strength is still in the emerging markets  so just looking at the traditional indicators of growth
and production i think the best guess is for a slow second half a slow beginning of 2009 and an
unemployment rate that continues to rise from here
i do believe that the financial stress and its implications for credit availability are
important in this whole dynamic  i guess president lacker and i keep talking past each other
but i dont think that the federal funds rate is an adequate description of the stance of monetary
policy  to give another example in the past we have used money growth as an indicator of
monetary policy  if we used that indicator it would look quite different  i think the appropriate
indicators are the rates and terms that are being faced by the people making decisions to spend in
the economy  you can go through the entire list and in every case as governor kohn
suggested the actual rates being faced in the data by borrowers are as high as or higher than they
were last summer  mortgages which are a particularly sensitive area are of course critical here
despite the decline in the federal funds rate the spread between mortgagebacked securities and
durationmatched treasuries is now about 260 basis points compared with 120 basis points last
summer  in addition for the spread between jumbo loans and conforming loans which in the
past has normally been between 25 and 50 basis points the offer rate is about 120 basis points
so there seems little doubtand we can check with governor duke about thisthat despite the
lower rate on overnight bank lending the rates that matter for economic activity are largely
higher than they were a year ago  therefore i dont think it is evident at all that we are in a
financial situation that is conducive to rapid excessive growth and inflationary increases a priori
now going forward of course a lot of what happens in the economy is going to depend
on bank balance sheets  i wont spend much time  in april i talked about the staffs estimates
of losses going forward  that has been updated  nellie liang is working with people in new
york  the numbers are not too encouraging under the baseline scenario forgetting about the
more severe scenarios  the staff now projects about 228 billion in losses for us banks and
thrifts in 08 and 09  that excludes investment banks  that excludes writedowns  if that
occurs it would be about a 2 percent loss rate over the next two years which would be above the
peak of 1991 and 1992  of course if the economy does worse it would be even higher
relative to that 228 billion in losses there are so far loanloss provisions of about 68 billion
so it looks as though we still have a long way to go in terms of bank losses and writedowns
in addition some of the biggest banks will take very significant hits  this is very
preliminary and i dont want to make too much of it but the preliminary analysis shows that for
five of the very biggest banks under a baseline scenario and looking at the composition of their
asset holdings their current tier 1 capital ratios will be reduced between 30 percent and
50 percent over the next two years  so there is a real concern about the availability of credit and
about the cost of credit  i could go on and talk about a variety of other areas including the
senior loan officer opinion survey which suggests that credit will be a concern going forward
president lacker and i have i hope respecti respect him and i hope he respects me
but we disagree also about president bullard on systemic risk  i take his criticism to be that it
works in practice but can it work in theory  systemic risk is an old phenomenon  there are
literally dozens and dozens of historical episodes that are suggestive of that phenomenon  there
is also an enormous theoretical literature  maybe it is not entirely satisfactory but certainly
many people have thought about that issue  i myself have obviously worked in this area
clearly it is not something that we can tightly explain in all aspects but i do think it is a
concern  we need to remain concerned about it  although it is true as president bullard points
out that there is an accommodation and a basis for anticipating crises as we go forward it is also
the case as i think governor mishkin noted that after a year we are also facing a situation of
greater fragility of much lower capital and fewer shock absorbers  those things will make any
crisis that much more severe should it occur  so overall i think there is still significant
downside risk to growth  i think the baseline of slow growth is right  i am hopeful that we will
see growth restored early next year but i think it is very uncertain at this point
on inflation i do have concerns as everyone else does  i think that the commodity price
movements we have seen are good news  they have been quite significant  besides oil prices
down about 10 percent and natural gas prices down about 32 percent since the last meeting corn
is off 27 percent soybeans 17 percent and wheat 16 percent  those are not small changes
now obviously the level of prices is still very high  it has risen considerably over the past year
we will continue to see that high level of prices being passed through into the core as governor
kohn noted but i would argue that ifand this is a very big ifcommodity prices do begin to
stabilize within the general range of what we see now i think that the inflation concerns will
moderate over time because they will have lost essentially their driving force  we dont really
have the conditions to turn the commodity price increases into persistent inflation absent
continued pressure on that front and absent changes in inflation expectations of which there is
only limited evidence at this point  so i want to be very clear  i think that containing inflation is
enormously important and i think it is our first responsibility  we need to watch this very
carefully  i think there will be continued pressures even if commodity prices dont rise but i do
think there is also a chance that we will see a moderation of this problem going forward
what else  i guess there has been a lot of discussion about the appropriate withdrawal of
stimulus  again i dont think i accept the idea that we are currently in an extremely stimulative
situation  however if financial markets were to normalize for example that would lead to a
more stimulative situation  i would like to say just a word about that  that is to say that the
speed at which we remove the accommodationand i think it is clear we do have to do that
relatively soonshould depend to some extent on how inflation evolves  under the more benign
scenario that i have just describedif inflation does decline significantly because of commodity
pricesi think that we obviously have more time  i would just note for comparison past
episodes  in 1994 for example the pause lasted 17 months and the first increase in rates came
two years after payrolls began growing again  in 2001 again it was more than a year after
unemployment rates started coming down and payrolls began growing before the rates started
going up
now i think there is a view which is a reasonable one that maybe in at least the second
of those two episodes we waited too long to begin to normalize  that is entirely possible  but
again it would be extraordinary if we were to begin raising rates without an immediate inflation
problem with the economy still in a declining or extremely weakened situation  if inflation does
in fact become the problem that many around the table think it is particularly if commodity
prices begin to go up again or if the dollar begins to weaken then i will be the first here to
support responding to that  i do think it is incredibly important to keep inflation expectations
well anchored particularly to the extent that movements of commodity prices and the dollar
seem to be derived from monetary policy as opposed to things like geopolitical risk  then i
think we cant treat them as truly exogenous  we would have to respond to those things  so i
welcome the ongoing discussion we should have about the pace of withdrawal of
accommodation  i do think it depends very much on how things evolve and i do think that our
strategy should be to watch carefully and to make the right decisions as we see the data come in
let me stop there and turn to the last round and ask brian please to introduce the policy
discussion
mr madigan2  thank you mr chairman  if you prefer in the interest of time i can cut back my remarks to focus just on the policy statement and not the general background  i will be referring to the version of table 1 included in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives this version incorporates some small revisions from the draft that was included in the august bluebook  the table presents two policy alternatives  under alternative b the committee would maintain its current policy stance at this meeting but in its statement would underscore its concerns about inflation  under alternative c the committee would firm policy 25 basis points today and issue a statement indicating that the action was taken to better balance the risks to growth and inflation the statement would be noncommittal about whether further rate increases were imminent
the language proposed for paragraph 2 of alternative b has been modified a little from that proposed in the bluebook  most important the first clause is now in the past tense referring to economic growth in the second quarter thus avoiding an implication that the economy is continuing to expand in the current quarter  in a change relative to the june statement exports as well as consumer spending are cited as factors that supported growth  also the sentence beginning with over time has been moved up from the risk assessment paragraph  that shift is likely to be seen as underscoring a view that policy is currently positioned to foster a gradual resumption of moderate economic growth suggesting that further easing is not likely to be forthcoming  that sense may also be reinforced by the omission of the phrase to date after easing of monetary policy  in paragraph 3 the inflation discussion for alternative b gives slightly greater emphasis than in june to the committees inflation

2  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
concerns partly by starting with the flat statement that inflation has been high and by giving less prominence to the expectation that inflation will moderate  the slight change to the final clause in paragraph 3 is proposed for purely stylistic reasons  in paragraph 4 the first sentence of the risk assessment states that although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee  while this sentence does not provide any explicit weighting of the two risks and does not suggest that policy firming is imminent the statement as a whole probably would be read as giving a bit more emphasis to inflation concerns and a bit less to growth concerns than market participants now expect  thus even though the absence of a rate action today would be consistent with market expectations the statement would likely be viewed by market participants as a bit more hawkish than they anticipated and market rates could rise modestly in response
turning to alternative c concerns about upside risks to inflation could motivate the committee to begin firming the stance of monetary policy at this meeting  the first three sentences of alternative c paragraph 2 are identical to those of alternative
b  however the final sentence differs partly by indicating explicitly that the committee sees the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative  also by dropping the phrase over time which appeared in paragraph 4 of the june version the committee would suggest that it sees moderate economic growth as resuming sooner rather than later  in paragraph 3 the committee would still note that inflation is expected to moderate but in the last sentence of the paragraph it would explicitly cite the riskand note its concernthat inflation might not fall as expected  finally the risk assessment paragraph 4 would indicate that the committee firmed policy today in order to better balance the upside risks to inflation and the downside risks to growth  however the statement would avoid an explicit judgment about whether the risks were now balanced and would provide little information about whether further tightening was imminent
even though the wording of the statement for alternative c would not indicate that policy was now on a steady firming march market participants would likely conclude that the firming process had been accelerated considerably relative to their expectations  with the committee having tightened amid bad news about financial institutions and in the immediate wake of the implementation of a number of additional federal reserve liquidity initiatives investors would likely conclude that the committee did not see financial stability considerations as raising a barrier to further policy tightening  they would view the committee as adopting a more aggressive posture toward inflation  because it has been historically rare for the federal reserve to implement a oneoff tightening investors would likely see fairly steady rate hikes over the course of future meetings and thus short and intermediate term interest rates would in all likelihood move up sharply after this action  yields on longerterm fixedrate mortgages might rise particularly substantially as premiums for interest rate and prepayment uncertainty increased and as mortgage investors hedged the increase in mortgage durations  such a development could adversely affect the prices of financial assets that are closely tied to housing markets and mortgage performance  however yields on longterm treasuries could decline
particularly if market participants marked down their expectations for economic growth and inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  any questions for brian  president fisher
mr fisher  in terms of the wording in paragraph 3 if we do not raise rates i am
wondering why the second sentence that is now in alternative c wouldnt be more appropriate
for alternative b and i am wondering what your thinking is about that  in other words if we
dont take action that seems to be a more emphatic statement than what you have currently
assuming no change in ratethe committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and
next year et ceterawhereas if we are trying to send a signal that we are really concerned and
we do not change rates why wouldnt we have used although the committee expects inflation
to moderate    the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant
concern  then maybe take the word also out of the fourth paragraph  it just seems to me
odd that if we act and describe the risk after acting the language is even stronger  whereas if we
dont act and we want to emphasize that we are remaining vigilant why wouldnt we use that
stronger language  i am curious as to why you chose the two or what you feel the tradeoff is
there
mr madigan  i would say president fisher that the substitution that you are
suggesting seems plausible to me but i would also say that the first sentence of alternative b
already does suggest some pretty significant concerns about inflation
chairman bernanke  all right  any other questions  let me start then with
president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative ano change in the funds
rate and a balanced assessment of risks designed to leave market expectations concerning the
path of the funds rate roughly unchanged  oops i made a mistake there is no a  laughter  so
i propose to create it by changing the wording of the first sentence of alternative b paragraph 4
to read both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of significant concern to
the committee  as it is currently worded b4 downplays the downside risks to growth which
have intensified since our last meeting as the credit crunch has worsened and emphasizes
inflation risks which have moderated slightly as oil prices have fallen  the assessment of risks
in alternative b as it stands is unbalanced andas brian just pointed out and the bluebook does
alsois more hawkish than the primary dealers and most market participants generally expect
so it is likely to shift the fed funds futures path and other interest rates upward
i see no case at this juncture for signaling that we are likely to adjust policy upward
before the end of the year  indeed there is a nonnegligible probability to my mind that the
next move will be down and not up  there is already significant slack in the labor market and
with the economy expected to grow at a nearrecessionary pace in the latter half of this year the
unemployment rate is poised to rise further  this growing slack is working to contain
inflationary pressures as evidenced by the stability and low level of wage growth  i expect that
growing slack will continue holding down wage inflation going forward  longterm inflation
expectations seem relatively well contained and core inflation has been stable for the past
several years  finally a major component of the surge in headline inflationoil price
increaseshas finally started to show some sign of reversing direction  although the real funds
rate remains quite accommodative by the usual metrics we are clearly not in a businessasusual
situation  we are in the midst of a serious credit crunch that has again worsened during the
intermeeting period as exemplified by the developments at freddie and fannie and the other
things that many of you have pointed to in our last round  we are likely seeing only the start of
what will be a series of bank failures that could make matters much worse  given these financial
headwinds it is not clear to me that we are accommodative at all i agree mr chairman with
the comments you just made on this matter
given my preference for an inflation target of around 1 percent and equal welfare
weights on the inflation and unemployment gaps i view the greenbook policy path and forecast
as a roughly optimal trajectory to the attainment of our goals  although core inflation exceeds
the level i consider consistent with price stability unemployment also exceeds the level
consistent with full employment  given our dual mandate and a forecast that envisions a
growing unemployment gap coupled with declining inflation under the greenbook funds rate
path i see no case for jolting expectations in such a way as to in effect tighten policy now  i
feel especially strongly about this in view of the major downside risks to the economy from an
intensifying credit crunch
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  a funny thing happened at my board meeting
the other week  i was all set to prepare them not for a rate change recommendation this time but
for one in the nottoodistant future  by the time i was done they were asking what the
procedure was for dissenting from my recommendation  so in fact they forwarded a
recommendation for an increase this time around
you know we can disagree over the inflationary consequences of a lot of this but i think
there is a message from around the table and the public our directors and whatnot that they do
feel that there is a concern about inflation  so i favor alternative c although i recognize the
reality of today  i am struggling with the fact that we lowered the funds rate rather aggressively
and things have worked out much better than we expected against the risks that we thought that
we were facing  we could disagree over that as well  i do take the point that uncertainty is very
high at the moment  but i think that we will need to increase rates sooner than currently
expected by markets  we are counting on a modest degree of slack and our credibility with the
public to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained while we leave rates on hold  but i
am concerned that there will be only modest inflationary restraint from the slack that we see and
that we may not be able to convince the public that they shouldnt worry about high headline
inflation
i certainly agree that bank balance sheets were pretty good in 2007 but i am concerned
that headline inflation has been above core inflation for quite a long time  i am not sure our own
balance sheets would reflect that  so by following a waitandsee strategy we are accepting a
large baseline inflation risk  in addition there is an enormous tail riskthat is a return to much
higher underlying inflation  also i was a little concerned to see in the dealer feedback to the
taf extensions that some market participants think that we will not increase the policy rate as
long as we keep the unusual and exigent determination in place  i am not sure that is a good
expectation for them to have  fundamentally it is my opinion that there has been a change in the
balance of the economic rationale and riskmanagement calculus that we used to lower the funds
rate to 2 percent  it is not a huge change but i think there has been a change  one year on the
economy has withstood the financial shock in a resilient fashion especially given the addon
shock from oil  i dont know what more we could have hoped for from the vantage point of the
fall of 2007 and the losses that have been taken
i think the odds of preventable negative feedback loops that we took out the last 75 basis
points of insurance against are somewhat smaller than they were five to six months ago  part of
our earlier logic to appropriately lower rates to a decidedly accommodative policy stance was to
guard against disorderly market conditions that might permanently damage our financial market
infrastructure and destroy the financial capital stock in a real productive sense the way that i
think president plosser was alluding to  but real forces have unmasked dramatic weaknesses and
faults in our financial system and markets will be evolving to a new intermediation structure
our policy can ease transitions only to a degree but it cannot restore the previous financial status
quo nor should it be aimed at doing so
during the transition i would not be surprised if we revisit periods of market volatility as
the disadvantaged players are repeatedly challenged to restructure to the new environment
counterparties are shying away from previous financial partners in part because of uncertainty
over the riskreturn profiles and the transitioning industry structure  these profiles involve both
liquidity risk and credit risk  i think our lending facilities allow a modest decoupling of the fed
funds rate setting to deal with this  in my view the balancing of current risks calls for increasing
the funds rate in the range of 50 maybe 75 basis points within some reasonably short period of
time  if events change importantly i would certainly advocate further adjustments in either
direction depending on how those risks adjust  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  i would just note on the unusual and exigent
issue that there are two schools of thought  the other school is the one you said which is that
having done this we would have the freedom to raise rates so i think it sort of cuts both
directions  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  in the interest of time i will be very
brief  i support alternative b in substance and concur with its wording  i think we are in a
delicate rhetorical balancing act at this stage and as brian described the slightly greater
emphasis on inflation is appropriate at this time  i think alternative b has substantially captured
the current situations and concerns of the majority of the committee so i support alternative b
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i appreciate the fact that reasonable people
may differ and i do differ  in saying that i am not advocating a tight monetary policy  i am
advocating a less accommodative monetary policy  i recognize governor kohns point that
relative prices are adjusting and others have made that point  i think around that context is the
fact that we are seeing a systematic increase in the price indexes both total and core and i dont
think we should ignore that  now the core is creeping up but up nevertheless and it is
systematic in my view  i would feel more comfortable that it was transitory if policy were not so
accommodative which affirms the likelihood of further increases in inflation going forward
that is really where i am focused i guess is the way to say it
we introduced the policy that we have as i think others mentioned as an insurance
policy early on when we were more in an immediate crisis  i dont negate or minimize the
tension that we are under but i do think we have become very accommodative in our policy with
negative real rates  so here we are with this insurance  we have this subpar growth  the subpar
growth is not going to go away soon so we are delaying removing the insurance policy  i worry
about that  i think in the long run that does increase the risk of an inflationary problem of a
sizable magnitude later on  i know we have this immediate problem but our role also is to take a
longrun view and i think we would be wise to raise the rate now modestly  it would still be an
easy policy  the effects of that increase might be disturbing to the markets  on the other hand
it might actually give more confidence to the markets that inflation is going to come down
because we are going to insist that it does  i think there would be some good effects from that
so that is where i am coming from on preferring that we move rates up slightly at this point
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i am going to make my remarks a little
shorter here  my judgment is that the current situation is a difficult one for the committee
because of the very appropriate focus on financial market turmoil over the past year our
attention has naturally turned away from keeping the level of interest rates consistent with
longerterm inflation objectives  this was done to avert particularly extreme but low
probability outcomes in which the economy would experience an especially severe downturn
as it turned out the bad state did not materialize which i think will go down in history as a
successful element of the committees policy over the past year  the ability to take on financial
market turmoil of this magnitude and prevent it from doing substantial damage to the economy
a recession of the magnitude of 198082 lets sayhas been a real achievement  in that sense
all has gone according to plan  at the same time we have moved interest rates to a very low
level in the context of rising inflation and rising inflation expectations  a severe downturn was
unwelcome to be sure but it was also projected to keep inflation in check  since that did not
materialize we are left with low rates and an environment of cpi inflation running at 5 percent
headline measured from one year earlier and longterm inflation expectations creeping higher
we face more risk now of creating a serious inflation problem than we have in a generation
to make progress i think we should keep rates steady today but with the plan of
preparing markets for an increase in rates at the september meeting conditional of course on
incoming data  this would be consistent with alternative b today and with intermeeting
statements it would move probability mass toward higher rates through the fall and through the
first half of 2009  i have several remarks on a fall tightening campaign  first of all moving
25 basis points is by itself not likely to have a large effect on economic activity nor does it bring the
level of the federal funds rate high enough to have a meaningful effect on inflation  the fomc
started tightening in mid2004 but achieved a core cpi inflation rate below 2 percent in only one
month during the entire threeyear period of 2005 2006 and 2007  what the move would do is get
the committee started on returning interest rates to a more normal level a level more consistent
with our inflation objectives  the committee could pause or even reverse course should
particularly adverse data suggest that economic activity was weakening substantially  preparing for
an increase in rates means that we would be signaling that financial market turmoil is no longer the
paramount concern  on that i think we can reasonably stress that we have provided
accommodation over the past year in the form of lower interest rates and innovative liquidity
facilities  we have bought time for financial firms to repair and adjust  while all is not as it was
we do not want to create an inflation problem in the aftermath of a shock of this magnitude which
may actually compound the situation and make it worse
longerterm inflation expectations have been creeping higher a fact that has been widely
cited in commentary on monetary policy  i would like to stress that in my view of a well
functioning inflationtargeting regime these inflation expectations would not be moving at all
shortterm interest rates would be moving higher and lower in response to shocks to the economy
and inflation expectations would never move  this would reflect the confidence that the central
banks shortterm interest rate adjustments were being accomplished in just the right way to offset
disturbances buffeting the economy  because of this i prefer not to interpret observed movements
in inflation expectations as evidence of what we should or should not do with respect to interest
rates  the shortterm interest rate would have to move to offset the shocks to the economy even if
longerterm inflation expectations never moved  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i support keeping the federal funds rate at
2 percent for now  i think that is consistent with bringing inflation down over time  i agree that
were going to have to tighten at some point  i agree with your analysis mr chairmani dont
think we have a highly accommodative policy right now  not only would i cite the interest rates
that you cited but i would cite the behavior of households and businesses which arent acting as if
theyre looking at very low real interest rates by making purchases of durable goods capital
equipment et cetera  the cost of capital is not perceived to be low right now and i think its for the
reasons you cited
in my view over the intermeeting period the inflation risks have narrowed just a bit  the
damper on inflation risk comes from the decline in oil and commodity prices the steadiness of the
dollar and my perception that we can count on a more negative output gap going forward which
will provide some discipline on prices and wages  this is a difficult situation  there are no ideal
outcomes when you have this change in relative prices  we will have to live with higher inflation
and higher unemployment temporarily  we have to keep our eye on the secondround effects not
just the passthroughs but the spillovers and i think so far so good  thats a tenuous situation i
agree but my read of the incoming information is that we can be a little more patient than we
thought we could be six or seven weeks ago
as for the wording of the statement i could live with president yellens rewording but i
think that this language brian suggested is okay as well  im actually not sure how the markets will
react to this  some of the commentary i read over the last couple of weeks thought that we were
tilted toward inflation last time because of the way we worded things  i dont think that the market
reaction will be large to this and i agree that the first choice would be not to change market
expectations substantially  i think theyre aligned pretty well right now but i think the reactions
will be small and i can live with the alternative b wording  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  as i indicated in the earlier goround i
found the balance of risks to economic growth and inflation to be essentially the same  so other
things being equal i might prefer to have risk assessment language that is even more balanced than
the risk assessment language that is presented in alternative b  but i have a tactical reason for
wanting to see words that express a stronger concern about inflation risk  i do as i said earlier
expect inflation to worsen before it improves  in particular as we have been discussing the core
statistics are likely to worsen notably during the next several months and i could just shrug those
worse numbers off because i have a projection that calls for those numbers to improve by early next
year  but im not confident that the public will shrug them off  as we have been talking about the
cost of longerterm inflation expectations drifting up is large  i believe that we can influence those
expectations and i think it is important that we do let the public know that we are serious about
opening the doors to a rate increase if that becomes necessary  we need the flexibility to move
nimbly and i think the language that is contained in alternative b puts the markets on notice  i
think alternative b enables us to hold our present strategy of watchful waiting but it does call
somewhat greater attention to inflation risks than we expressed at the conclusion of our last meeting
so i find both the strategy and the language of alternative b to be quite appropriate for the
circumstances we face today  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b and the language as
displayed here  let me say a few words about the issue of withdrawal of accommodation which
ive been giving thought to and will want to give more thought to over time  earlier today i talked
about the greenbook forecast and indicated that i found it credible  but another virtue of it even if
you dont find it that credible is that the cards are on the table  i mean it has a path for the federal
funds rate  it has a path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and so on and so forth  two of
the key elements as i indicated earlier are at least over the nearterm to intermediateterm that real
growth is subdued and that headline inflation abates after the current quarter and i think thats
relevant  given the current stance of policy i think we are well positioned for that subdued pace of
real growth  indeed even if we get contraction for a quarter or two i would argue that we have
maybe not entirely but largely already addressed that
on the inflation side it seems to me that the key part of that forecast is the diminution of
headline inflation starting in the fourth quarter  what that means as a practical matter is that in
november december and january when we get those data well get confirmation that it is either
happening or its not  now assuming that there are no major decisive surprises between now and
thenand that may be heroicwell get confirmation of whether that inflation outlook was the
accurate one  if we do then it seems that the path of the funds rate inherent in the greenbook looks
as though it could be acceptable  if we get disappointments on headline inflation for whatever
combination of reasons it calls into question at least in my mind that path for the funds rate
thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  for my part our exchanges have in the past
been predicated on nothing but the utmost respect  i expect that to continue  if i have done
anything or said anything to contribute to any other impression i regret it and i apologize
chairman bernanke  that wasnt my intention president lacker
mr lacker  in the interest of avoiding talking past each other let me say a bit about
why i view real rates as low  i recognize what you and governor kohn said about other interest
rates  but when i look at the low real rate now and at times in the past when it has been low and i
look at things like corporate borrowing rates then they didnt fall nearly as much as the fed funds
rate  if you plot them by lining up the nber dates it doesnt look as though whats happened now
with those borrowing rates is out of line with past experiences  so if we think now that real rates
were low in 03 im led to conclude that i ought to think that they are low currently
another way of saying this is that spreads always go up in recessions  we drive real rates
down in recessions  if consumers and businesses were spending with frenzy now because of low
rates to me that would be a reason that we have to raise them get them up right away  you know
my sense of the economics of why we push real rates low in recessions is that the state of aggregate
demand needs it  its exactly when consumer and business spending is sort of moribund that we
have real rates low  im not sure that the fact that its moribund tells me whether theyre low or not
relative to where they ought to be  thats how i think about that evidence but i look forward to
being enlightened further in the future on this
chairman bernanke  you raise a good pointthat we ought to look empirically at
the relationship between borrowing rates and the federal funds rate in this episode and other
episodes which we really havent done  so we need to do that  thank you
mr lacker  ill dispense with the rest of my prepared remarks and just say that i
recognize the real risks ahead of us  weve experienced sluggish growth and all the downside risks
to growth that have been enumerated are very tangible and very plausible right now  i think we
should hold off raising rates at this meeting but im very concerned about the inflation risks  i find
myself leaning toward a tightening campaign earlier rather than later and id like to see the
statement do what it can to prepare markets for that  i liked the first version of alternative b the one
without the word also  i think also damps the concern about inflation  it kind of makes it a
little too balanced for my taste  im also concernedi should say broadly that we seem to
have left the impression over the past several months since the beginning of the year that our
concerns about inflation fluctuate  i agree with president bullard  what we ought to view as ideal
is an equilibrium where inflation expectations are rock solid and dont change and moreover that
people dont perceive our concerns and worry about inflation or the weight were giving in policy
deliberations as shifting from time to time  so thats an aspect of our communications that concerns
me  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i support alternative b  i would actually prefer president yellens
language but definitely believe that we should have the word also in there  tightening at this time
would sap more strength from an already weak economy and should the forecast look like the
severe financial stress scenario or the typical recession scenario it would be extremely poorly
timed  if the data indicate that inflation is not ebbing as i expect and the economy is on a surer
footing than i fear then it would be appropriate to begin what is likely to be a series of increases in
the federal funds target  but the data to date dont indicate that so i support alternative b
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman im already out of the closet in terms of my economic
proclivities  i realize its awkward for some folks but i havent heard enough today that would
change my view that we are running an overaccommodative monetary policy  i agree with your
point very much that the rates and the terms being faced by those who drive the economy count  as
to governor kohns point that some of these key rates have not come down i think that has more to
do with risk premiums and i hate to see it migrate toward inflation premiums which i believe is a
significant risk  im obviously driven by what i hear from my contacts although i respect the
analytics you mentioned governor mishkin  my longrun thinking is as conditioned by
globalization as it is by domestic policy and i just still have a great concern about the wageprice
spiral thats taking place in some of our manufacturing centers in the developing countries
i think it would be wise just to shift my analogy here and think in canine terms to take a
newspaper across the snout and call for a 25 basis point increase  were always talking about
tightening at some point  i think it just becomes increasingly difficult to take that first step  i grant
you that the economy is weak  the financial situation is brittle  that hasnt changed in my view
but the inflationary behavioral patterns that im beginning to hear about reinforce my concern about
an updrift in the core and the headline data  so i apologize it perhaps is being a little too strong to
say that weve become unmoored or that maybe we are no longer anchored  i think that is
nonetheless a real perception  im going to vote against alternative b and for alternative c  i may
be a minority of one but perhaps ill be a sea anchor if you understand the sailing analogy here
and assist the process of our commitment to be focused on inflation as a risk just as we focused on
downside risk to growth  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as you can imagine as weve discussed this
meeting presents a difficult policy position for usand for me in particular  i think we must pay
careful attention to the financial market volatility and to the extent that it has consequences for the
real economy im certainly sensitive to that concern  i had a similar experience with my board of
directors that president evans did  i went into my board recommending no change and got
considerable pushback in discussion about how we dissent and what the consequences of doing
that are  they are concerned about inflation and im concerned about our mandate to keep longer
term and intermediateterm inflation in check
were unlikely in my view to get confirming or convincing evidence about whether
expectations have become unanchored until well after the fact  i agree there has been very little
wageprice pressure to date  but that will be the last shoe to drop in this sequence of raising
expectations and by the time we get to that im afraid it will be too late  i think in the near term we
might see some relief in headline inflation but as has been discussed whether that will persist is
highly dubious
my real concern is that i believe that monetary policy is accommodative and with all due
respect mr chairman when i look at the data comparing the levels of borrowing rates of
consumers and businesses both the levels in real and nominal terms and the spreads what we see in
this period looks remarkably similar to what weve seen in lots of other recessionary slow growth
periods  so again following the analogy that president lacker was using i see this period as less
atypical and more typical of what we see in slowgrowth periods  i think its important that we
begin to prepare the markets for an impending shift to a tighter policy  i agree with president
hoenig  the request here is not for tight policy but somewhat less accommodative policy and if we
choose to go with no funds rate increase today i think the language must help prepare the markets
going forward
im pleased with a lot of the discussion around the table  we are actually beginning to talk
i think about what our exit strategy is going to be from this  i think its very important to have
those conversations and i appreciate them  i too share the observations that president evans had
about talking with people who say well we cant possibly remove accommodation until we get
rid of the facilities  i think that is wrong  as you said mr chairman actually having the facilities
might make it easier for us to correct monetary policy and i think thats very very important
i guess my bottom line is that i can accept leaving the funds rate unchanged today as long as
our language is sufficiently strong about inflation  to that end i was actually a little more
comfortable with the draft table 1  i didnt like the addition of the word also  i thought that
weakened the statement  i would prefer paragraph 4 without the also  i also have one other
minor observation about paragraph 3 and thats the first sentence which says that inflation has
been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
well i think thats partly true but im concerned that somehow it conveys the impression that the
problem with inflation is oil and commodities when in fact more correctly my concern about
inflation is not just oil  my concern is about the stance of policy  so i would put on the table the
possibility of saying that inflation has been high partly spurred by high oil and commodity prices
to say that its more than just the shortterm behavior of commodity prices  i think the word also
means that inflation concerns there are added as an afterthought which is my reading of the change
from the draft table 1 to paragraph 4  so i prefer that also be eliminated  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  ill be brief  i favor alternative b as written and
presented  i think it strikes the right balance by highlighting the risks that we see on the inflation
front and i agree with brians characterization that the capital markets reaction might be a little
surprise  it is hard for us in a time like this to predict exactly how the capital markets are going to
interpret this but it wouldnt surprise me to see some initial market reaction that is ostensibly
negative  that doesnt trouble me too much  ideally the removal of policy accommodation which
we talked about today would be from a position of strength not weakness but we may or may not
have the luxury of waiting for that opportunity  finally i think its important over this period that
we not be perceived to be lurching  i think alternative b strikes the right balance of explaining our
concerns and provides us reasonable optionalitythat is as youve described previously state
determined rather than timedetermined  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  i support no change alternative b  as i mentioned before
i dont want to put the commodity price decreases and energy price decreases in the bank and say
we dont have any problems going forward  but we also cant ignore them and i think that does
take off a bit of the pressure  it also manifests itself in some of the survey numbers and some of the
marketbased numbers in terms of expectations  so i think it allows a little more time as someone
said earlier to be patient to make the determination given that i still think there are some very real
downside risks as ive mentioned
i think this type of statement will be largely consistent with market expectations although i
do think and brian can correct me that this is one of the first times that we have made a very clear
statement such as inflation has been high  i think thats a bit of a change from where we have
been  thats a much stronger acknowledgement of the inflation situation which i think is
appropriate to be acknowledging  but i do think that it may send a relatively strong signal to the
market and it makes me feel more comfortable about no change today with the statement because it
shows a lot of concern about the level of inflation in actually characterizing it as high  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  just let me talk a little about monetary policy
and ill be brief there  but then i have to use my opportunity to raise some issues for the committee
when im not here  i do support alternative b  as is obvious from my earlier discussion i believe
that the risks are balanced  i have one modification to janets language because i think it is just
simpler to say that the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of concern to the
committee  i dont see the need for both but were actually on the same wavelength in terms of
this issue
what id like to spend some time onbecause i feel this is sort of my swan song but
maybe because im a classy guy ill call this my valedictory remarksare three concerns that i
have for this committee going forward  im not going to be able to participate but i have a chance
now to lay them out  the first is the real danger of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as
reflecting the stance of monetary policy  this is very dangerous  i want to talk about that  second
is that i think its absolutely critical that we keep our options open in the current circumstances and
so i want to talk about that  the third is on the communication issue but its not going to be on
inflation objectives  ive already talked about that enough in public so its clear to you one way or
the other  i hope you consider it but thats something that i dont need to go into here
first of all let me talk about the issue of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as
indicating the stance of monetary policy  this is something thats very dear to my heart  i have a
chapter in my textbook that deals with this whole issue and talks about the very deep mistakes that
have been made in monetary policy because of exactly that focus on the shortterm interest rate as
indicating the stance of monetary policy  in particular when you think about the stance of
monetary policy you should look at all asset prices which means look at all interest rates  all asset
prices have a very important effect on aggregate demand  also you should look at credit market
conditions because some things are actually not reflected in market prices but are still very
important  if you dont do that you can make horrendous mistakes  the great depression is a
classic example of when they made two mistakes in looking at the policy interest rate  one is that
they didnt understand the difference between real and nominal interest rates  that mistake im not
worried about here  people fully understand that  but it is an example when nominal rates went
down but only on defaultfree treasury securities in fact they skyrocketed on other ones  the
stance of monetary policy was incredibly tight during the great depression and we had a disaster
the japanese made the same mistake and i just very much hope that this committee does not make
this mistake because i have to tell you that the situation is scary to me  im holding two houses right
now  im very nervous  laughter
the second issue is that its absolutely critical that we keep our options open  this relates to
the points that i already made in my discussioni argued that we dont know where this situation
of financial stress is actually going to head and that the potential for shoes dropping and bad things
happening out there is real  i think its likely that it wont happen but its a significant probability
with very serious negative consequences  in that situation we dont know exactly the direction of
where we have to go  i was actually very pleased with president evanss comments  charlie has
been a good friend for a long time and he is one of the people i have tremendous respect for as an
economist  although we had a disagreement in our view of monetary policy today on the issue
going forward i was pleased to see that you actually indicated that there is a possibilitywe hope it
doesnt happen by the waythat things go south and that we actually have to be much more
aggressive on monetary policy and on liquidity issues  i know that there have been some concerns
on the committee about that as well but no option should be taken off the table if bad things
happen and we cannot get boxed in  i feel very very strongly about that
i would also say that the same issue comes up in terms of inflation  i have argued very
strenuously for nongradualism in a situation like the one were in  we are in a different world when
we are in a situation of financial stress and its very possible that we might have to raise rates very
quickly  theres a good news case and a bad news case  the good news case is that housing prices
stabilize  that could actually turn things around very quickly  i think bill if im not incorrect you
mentioned that possibility and i think youre absolutely right  in that kind of situation our policy
would become very accommodative  i do not think its too accommodative at all right now  i think
its balanced its appropriate  but if the financial markets improve it will become much too
accommodative very quickly and we then have to respond very quickly in order not to have
inflationary consequences  id like to see that happen by the way
the other case which i would not like to see happen is that inflation expectations get
unhinged  i have seen no evidence that longrun inflation expectations have gotten unhinged but
there is substantial risk  if that happened we would also have to move up very quickly  so i really
implore this committee to keep your options open  do not get boxed in  lets hope and pray
lets all get around in a circle and hold handsthat oil prices fall which will also help us not get
boxed in  don i told you i was going to be a little colorful  he was waiting for this one  i should
mention that don was actually at a conference where he talked about constraints on peoples
behavior as a result of the transcripts being recorded and he said but not rick  laughter
the third issue is something about which i am less constrained which is communications  i
would not have talked about this earlier but it really does worry me  we have a complicated
governance structure in this committee which i actually think is the right governance structure
we have two types of groups that vote on this committee  we have the people who are presidential
appointees and then confirmed by the senate who are board members and i will soon not be one of
them  ill be a civilian again  then we have bank presidents who are much more tied into the
private sector because your boards of directors which are composed of privatesector people
recommend you  then we do have some role but theyre the primary people who decide who
becomes a bank president
i think thats a very good framework  it actually serves us very well  ive been on both
sides  ive been on the other side of the fence not as a president but as an executive vice president
it serves us very well because we have a link to the private sector that we normally would not have
importantly it keeps us real in terms of information and theres a group of people out there who are
not in washington or new york because people also have a hard time about new york but who
tend to be very important supporters for us politically  so this is a system that i would very much
like to see preserved  it does have a problem because of the different roles here  what i have been
very concerned aboutand i have had people in the markets speak to me about thisis that
recently i had a very prominent central bank governor say to me what in the hell are you guys
doing  the issue here is that we need to have a situation where bank presidents and also members
of the board can speak their views  they may have different views and i very much encourage that
in terms of discussion of where they think the economy is going which is what we do inside and i
think that does need to be done outside the committee because it shows that there are different
views that were thinking about it that were trying to learn from each other and so forth and so
on  what is very problematic from my viewpoint are the speeches discussions and interviews
outside when people talk about where they think interest rates should head and where the policy
rate should head  thats where the criticism has been coming from  i have to tell you that a lot of
people whom i respect tremendously are saying to me that its making us look like the gang that
cant shoot straight  i think its a really serious problem  i understand that we want to keep the
priority of speaking our minds but we have to work as a team and i think that were having a
problem in this regard
let me talk about why i think this is dangerous  its dangerous in terms of policy setting
you can see this is very blunt  clearly if you were in a multiperiod game you wouldnt be this
blunt  but now im not going to be here anymore so you can hate mei dont care  laughter
but this kind of cacophony on this issue has the potential to damage us in two very serious ways
one is that it weakens the confidence in our institution and i have to tell you that i love this
institution  its very hard for me to leave this place but its something i have to do  if the
institution is damaged in terms of the confidence that the public and the politicians have in us it will
hurt us deeply  it will hurt us in terms of policy because it will weaken our credibility which
actually will make it harder to control inflation  so i consider this a very serious cost  the second
issue is on the political front  it is very possible that were going to have a reopening of the federal
reserve act with the next administration and the next congress  the reason i think it is possible is
that we have to restructure our regulatory structure  theres no way to get around itwe are in a
brave new world on this  that could lead to an opening of this issue  the problem here is in that
opening there are a lot of people in the congress who are very uncomfortable having policymakers
who are not presidential appointees and confirmed by the senate  two outcomes could come out of
that  one is that they could take the vote away from the presidents which i think would be a
disaster because then youre not going to have good people going into the system  we wont have
boards of directors that will be good  we wont have all of the benefits that we think we have from
the current system  the other alternative is that we then have presidents who are actually appointed
by the president and then confirmed by the senate  i think again that hurts the private linkage
so i feel very strongly about all three of these issues but i think that youre going to come
up with serious challenges in the future that could be very damaging to the system  so i hope you
think about this and still like me for being blunt and also miss me because there will be a little less
amusement  who else would have brought monty python into the fomc  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you governor mishkin  governor duke
ms duke  thank you  i support alternative b  i dont think that the severe financial
stress scenario is out of the question right now
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b for
the reasons that you and many others have already stated
chairman bernanke  thank you  i want to thank everyone for your comments
today  i know we dont have agreement around the table but as somebody once said if everybody
agrees then everybody except one is redundant  laughter  i listened very carefully to what has
been said  i understand your concerns  i think hard about themi do every day  as we go
forward we will obviously continue to have these fruitful discussions
i do think that we need to continue to clarify this exit strategy issue  one point i would
make and governor warsh alluded to it is that we need to think of this as a statedependent rather
than a timedependent strategy  we need to be clear not so much as to whether we are or are not
going to raise rates but under what circumstances and why and what our objectives are  on that
basis i reiterate that my greater attention recently to financial and real conditions has to do with my
view of the risks rather than my objective function
i recommend no action today and alternative b  there were a number of suggestions for
changes  i think i will avoid them just to avoid further controversy  my reasons for suggesting
alternative b were well stated by president pianalto  its hard to judge  i dont know what the
markets will make of this but my intention is for it to be slightly hawkishto indicate a slight
upward tilt in policywhich has several functions  first if we dont move it emphasizes our
ongoing concern with inflation and perhaps provides some prophylactic protection with respect to
expectations and so on  on the other hand if conditions do warrant action and it could be quick
action at least we will have provided the markets with some warning and some indication of our
concern about this issue  so thats my recommendation  any comments  would you call the roll
ms danker  yes  this vote includes the alternative b language from the table
distributed this morning and the directive from the bluebook
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with
maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 2 percent
