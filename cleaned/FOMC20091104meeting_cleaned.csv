november 3 2009afternoon session
 
chairman bernanke good afternoon everybody  as has been our custom recently this is a joint boardfomc meeting  can i get a motion to close the meeting 
mr kohn so moved 
chairman bernanke thank you we would like to welcome to the table president kocherlakota from minneapolis  narayana is a very distinguished scholar  everyone who is familiar with modern economics would know his name and his work  he is new to the fomc but not to the fed you have been a staff member and a research consultant in minneapolis for more than a decade  so we look very much forward to working with you and getting the benefit of your insight welcome 
mr kocherlakota  thanks a lot  i am honored to be here 
chairman bernanke the first item on our agenda is financial developments open market operations and laughter 
mr plosser actually ben this is for you 
chairman bernanke let the record show that president plosser is wearing a phillies hat laughter we dont take sides here in washington  all right 
mr plosser i thought we have all red sox fans and all mets fans with us  laughter 
chairman bernanke okay let me turn to brian sack for a report on financial developments open market operations and system credit facilities  brian 
mr sack1 footnote 1 the materials used by mr sack are appended to this transcript appendix 1 end footnote 1  thank you the surge in the prices of risky assets that has taken place since march cooled off over the intermeeting period as investors took note of the economic risks that remain and the ongoing difficulties facing the financial sector  as shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit broad equity indexes declined modestly on net since the last fomc meeting  that is a notable downshift from the gains posted over the previous four intermeeting periods which averaged over 8 percent per period 
the drop in equity prices occurred despite favorable earnings surprises for the third quarter as shown in the top right panel more than 80 percent of the firms in the sp 500 index beat expectationsan unusually high portion by historical standards however investors also focused on the growth of revenue which was generally less impressive and questioned the sustainability of profit growth  moreover equity prices no longer benefited from the substantial upward revisions to the economic outlook that had propelled earlier gains  indeed recent economic data have been seen as mixed and the gdp forecasts of most market participants were essentially unchanged from the previous fomc meeting as indicated in the dealer survey responses in the middle left panel 
one factor weighing on stocks was a growing concern among investors about prospects for financial firms  banks earnings reports continued to highlight many of the problems facing that sector and investors also became increasingly concerned about how pending regulatory changes would affect those institutions  as a result financial shares lost ground over the intermeeting period as shown in the middle right panel nonfinancial firms continued to be seen as relatively healthy  indeed yield spreads on corporate bonds narrowed further over the intermeeting period although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year as shown in the bottom left panel  
overall despite their sharp gains from earlier in the year we do not see equity or corporate bond prices as stretched well beyond fundamental values  this can be seen in the boards equity premium measure shown to the right which is wide by historical standards it is also reflected in recent work by the new york fed staff on highyield bonds suggesting that those yield spreads are near the levels expected given the outlook for defaults our assessment is that overall the levels of us asset prices appear reasonable   nevertheless this assessment could change if the very rapid gains from earlier in the year were to continue  in this regard the flattening out of asset prices since the last meeting could be regarded as a favorable development as it suggests that those prices are still connected to fundamentals 
as shown in the next exhibit treasury yields were little changed on balance since the last fomc meeting  in part this pattern reflects that the incoming economic news has been mixed and has not provided any clear direction for yields  investors also took note of the considerable volume of commentary by fed officials  as shown in the top right panel fomc members gave no less than 30 speeches in the month of october  im all for central bank transparency but this may be going a bit far laughter many of those speeches were seen by the markets as containing directional information about the likely course of monetary policy and investors saw some of those messages as conflicting with one another  in part for this reason investors marked down the grade they gave you on communications in our dealer survey despite all of the focus on these speeches the implied policy path was little changed on net as shown in the middle left panel  investors continue to expect policy to remain on hold until at least the middle of 2010 
this accommodative policy stance is one of the factors that market participants see as contributing to the decline in the dollar from earlier this year as shown in the middle right panel  the degree of angst about the dollar seems to have been building in recent months as its weakness has been widely discussed among market participants a key policy question is whether the dollar movement reflects an appropriate response to the outlook for the economy and policy or whether it is the beginning of a more abrupt decline that could ultimately produce a problematic increase in inflation or inflation expectations  we lean toward the former explanation the decline to date has been smooth and orderlyat a pace not much different from that seen before the fall of 2008  in fact over this intermeeting period the dollar was essentially flat against our major trading partners  moreover some of the recent weakening reflects an unwinding of the surge in the dollar that took place during the financial crisis it is also worth noting that currency options markets do not seem to be pricing in considerable odds of an abrupt dollar decline as indicated in the pricing of riskreversals against the euro in the bottom left panel  these do not show a premium for protection against sizable dollar depreciation and in fact are now pointed in the opposite direction  
that said we are mindful of the risks that are present given the widespread focus of investors on this issue moreover the treasury market is pricing in a bit more inflation protection than was the case at the last fomc meeting  as shown in the bottom right panel some measures of forward breakeven inflation rates have turned higher of late though they are still within historical ranges  in any event we will closely monitor these markets for any signs that a more definitive correlation between dollar weakness and inflation expectations is developing  
as covered in your next exhibit the desk completed the last of its scheduled treasury purchase operations last week i thought it would be useful to provide a summary of the program and to discuss its effects  in total the desk conducted sixty outright purchase operations in treasury securities bringing the cumulative total purchases to 300 billion on the nose the top left panel shows the pace of purchases that we implemented over the program including the tapering of the purchases at the end of the program  the top right panel shows the distribution of the securities purchased across maturities  as was announced in a desk statement at the start of the program the purchases spanned all outstanding maturities beyond a year but the majority of securities purchased were in the two to tenyear sector  with these purchases the desk removed a considerable portion of the duration that was issued to the market over that period  
the middle two panels indicate that market functioning has improved over the period covered by the purchase program  the left panel shows the amount of dispersion across treasury yields relative to our smoothed yield curve which could be taken as a proxy for the degree to which balance sheet constraints and extreme risk aversion prevented relative value trading in the market  this measure has come in notably with many attributing some of that pattern to our purchases  liquidity measures for the treasury market have also improved  bidasked spreads have also come in from the high levels earlier this year and the depth of market quotes shown to the right has risen overall the treasury market has recovered notably from the strains during the crisis and there are no signs that our pullback from the market is causing that improvement to reverse  
the other key issue is whether the treasury purchases along with the other lsap programs were successful at lowering longerterm yields  some have pointed to the fact that the 10year treasury yield has risen since the onset of purchases and have used that fact to argue that the program was not effective  we do not find that argument particularly compelling  the problem is that it fails to define the counterfactual of what would have happened to yields in the absence of the purchases in fact many regression models of longerterm yields would have predicted them to rise over this period  this can be seen from a modification of the backuswright yield model from their 2007 brookings publication shown in the bottom left panel  the fact that yields remain below the models prediction is at least suggestive that the asset purchases have had some effect  a different approach to measuring the effects of asset purchases is based on eventstudy  as was presented to the committee earlier in the year this exercise takes a list of dates on which important announcements were made about lsaps and aggregates the movements in yields on those dates the updated results shown in the bottom right panel indicate that the yield movements around lsap announcements were substantial  together the regression and eventstudy evidence suggests that lsap programs have had notable effects in lowering treasury yields  we associate these effects primarily with changes to the stock of securities arising through a portfolio balance channel and hence we would not expect them to unwind as purchases end  to date that appears to be playing out indeed the market barely noticed the end of the treasury purchase programwhich is what we had hoped would happen  
as i noted in the last briefing we are somewhat more worried about how the markets will react to the winding down of the agency debt and mbs purchase programs  even in those markets however the basic message is so far so good  the top panels of exhibit 4 show the pace of purchases for agency debt and mbs  as can be seen the desk has begun to follow the tapering program that was decided at the last fomc meeting  this strategy will slowly reduce the pace of purchases while still getting to total levels consistent with the desk directives for mbs the projected path takes total purchases to 125 trillion  for agency debt the desk directive had given us some flexibility but we were following a path aimed at a total purchase amount of 175 billion 
as could be seen in the eventstudy results the effects of the lsaps appear to have been even greater on agency securities and mbs than on treasury securities causing those spreads to narrow the middle panels show the history of spreads on the two asset classes as we have noted before spreads relative to treasury securities appear unusually tight part of the concern of market participants is that the purchase programs have driven spreads to these narrow levels and that the end of the programs will cause them to move back to historical norms pushing agency securities and mbs rates higher however it is hard to judge the magnitude of this risk  in that regard it is worth noting that the mbs spread does not look unusually narrow when measured relative to swaps as shown to the left  
mbs purchases may have an additional effect on mbs rates beyond their influence on optionadjusted spreads  purchases of mbs not only remove duration from the market they also remove prepayment risk  investors generally find it challenging to hold the negative convexity of mbs associated with prepayment risk and hence they demand an extra return to bear that risk which keeps mbs rates higher than they would otherwise be the removal of a considerable amount of this risk by the feds purchases could therefore work to lower mbs rates by offsetting this effect accordingly it might be useful to watch the pricing of instruments that markets use to hedge this risk such as the implied volatility from swaptions shown in the bottom left panel to see if they come under any upward pressure as the fed backs away from its mbs purchases   
lastly i would like to make a note about the distribution of our mbs purchases  there was a period earlier this year when refinancing activity led to a greater amount of production of new mbs with coupons of 4 and 45 percent  the desk strategy taken at that time was to concentrate purchases in those coupons in order to soak up the new supply and facilitate this refinancing  this can be seen in the current distribution of our mbs holdings the dark blue bars in the bottom right panel  more recently we have begun to spread out our purchases into higher coupons and plan to continue to do so this strategy is reflected in the distribution of holdings that we project for the end of the program shown by the light blue bars  the purpose of this shift is to achieve greater diversification in our holdings across coupons  the highercoupon securities will be relatively more liquid than the lowercoupon securities in the event that mortgage rates increase which could prove useful if the committee wants to engage in larger amounts of dollar rolls or to conduct outright sales  
these assetpurchase programs have pushed the total size of the balance sheet up to about 22 trillion as shown in the top left panel of the last exhibit  outright asset holdings now account for about 17 trillion of that total  it is this component of the balance sheet that presents the most significant exit challenges as those holdings will run off only slowly on their own and will therefore keep reserves in the banking system for a long time  the staffs work on developing tools for draining reserves and for raising shortterm interest rates is advancing well as jim clouse and chris burke will cover in their briefings  and the market seems generally to accept that we have sufficient tools to exit however market participants are increasingly looking for guidance on how the tools will be usedfor example what will be the timing of reserves draining relative to increases in the ioer rate and what quantity of reserves will be taken out of the system  
as shown to the right the desk asked dealers about the likelihood of various tools being used to drain reserves not surprisingly respondents placed high odds on the fomc using reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits  what was more surprising was that the respondents put about 50 percent odds on using outright asset sales as well however there was considerable disagreement about the likelihood of asset sales with the responses ranging from 5 percent to 100 percent odds as indicated by the line 
in contrast the exit from liquidity facilities is already well along toward completion  those facilities were priced to facilitate their winddown  as shown in the middle left panel that process has worked well as the improvement in money market functioning and the abundant supply of reserves have made our programs unattractive to most borrowers leading to a dramatic shrinking in the volume of activity at those programs  currently only four of the programs have any outstanding volume with the total amount of credit totaling about 200 billion  
although the exit design has worked well overall it might require some effort to get the remaining balances to shrink to zero in an orderly way  indeed as i pointed out in my last briefing the fed faces an adverseselection problem in which the remaining firms are the ones with morelimited opportunities to obtain outside financing with this in mind the federal reserve staff has begun to engage the firms remaining in the facilities on a bilateral basis to encourage them to plan for transitioning away from the feds facilities these discussions have already helped this process notably  the remaining firms have received a clearer signal that such a transition is necessary and have made progress toward developing alternative liquidity plans as indicated in the middle right panel the number of firms remaining in the facilities has declined and we will continue to engage those remaining firms to ensure a smooth exit  
i will close by discussing another issue in money marketsthe approaching yearend the bottom left panel shows the estimated effect of the yearend on the twomonth libor rate and compares it with the levels observed at this point during past yearend periods unlike previous yearends we are not seeing much upward pressure on the libor rate this observation could reflect the fact that the demand for unsecured credit is fairly limited given the abundance of reserves and liquidity in the system  
where we may see some unusual behavior over the yearend is in the treasury market  it is possible that the heightened demand for safe assets will cause treasury bill yields and gc repo rates for treasury collateral to turn negative over yearend  indeed the implied forward rate for bills for the week spanning yearend is already at around minus 15 basis points as shown in the bottom right panel  this is not an 
unusual degree of softness relative to other shortterm interest rates however it is 
notable because given the low absolute level of rates this softness pushes the yield 
into negative territory 

this consideration raises a policy question of whether the federal reserve should 
use its balance sheet to offset such a development  we could do so by supplying 
more treasury collateral to the market either by a special tslf operation over year
end or through reverse repurchase agreements  as for now we are inclined to think 
that mildly negative treasury yields are not problematic and would not require such a 
policy response however any signs that the rates are going more deeply negative 
and are causing disruption to market functioning could change that assessment  
thank you 

chairman bernanke thank you questions for brian president fisher 
mr fisher brian there has been an enormous amount of chatter and some articles written about the carry trade and i wonder from a desk perspective being more marketoriented and less from a theoretical standpoint if you could give us your views on the arguments put forward by roubini and others  is this a problem or is it a nonissue 
mr sack there is a lot of talk about the carry trade and i think when we talk about the carry trade we need to be careful to distinguish whether we are talking about a fundamental story that we would expect to take place or whether we are talking about something beyond that the fundamental story would be that low financing rates in the united states should make it attractive to borrow and to go long other assets and you should evaluate the return on those other assets relative to the return that investors could get on a riskfree asset which is quite low  to the degree that the carry trade reflects that activity i think it is perfectly reasonable and desirable the question is do we see so much activity that it goes beyond that where the low financing rates are causing asset prices to go up too far because there is too much leverage and too much risktaking 
that is what i tried to focus on in the context of us assets in exhibit 1  i think the only way to answer that question is to turn to the models and try to make an assessment of fair value  and for us assets we do not see a problem at this point because as i said we think they are fairly priced  i do think there are greater concerns regarding assets outside the united states in particular emerging market assets  we dont look at those in detail so i dont have as detailed an answer but we have certainly heard quite a bit of concern being expressed about the prices on those assets being pushed up too far  so i think it is a concern or it is a risk to be aware of but i would think at this point it is directed toward emergingmarket asset prices   
mr fisher thank you 
chairman bernanke any other questions  president bullard 
mr bullard yes im looking at exhibits 17 and 18 which show the effects of largescale asset purchases and we have some pretty substantial effects here which i can see and i agree with but there are no measures of uncertainty around these  so i wonder if you could comment on how much confidence you would put in these estimates because they are probably very difficult to estimate  now the one on the left maybe looks as though some statistical significance is there 
mr sack the short answer is that there is a lot of uncertainty about calibrating the effects  absolutely  and the uncertainty in these two panels comes from different sources in some way  in the one on the left like any model of fair value the results have only a certain degree of statistical significance and can depend on the type of model that you write down  this model actually includes a supply variable directly which it does find is statistically significant and then we can use that to back out in the context of the model what it thinks the effects of the lsaps would be  the point estimate is something around 50 basis points but it has a confidence interval that certainly spans easily from 20 to 80 or so 
the uncertainty on the right is a bit different but equally important  the advantage of the eventstudy exercise is to zoom in on the lsap events so that we can be sure we are isolating the effect of the lsaps of course the downside of eventstudies is that they give you no perspective on whether those effects persist and what the dynamics are thereafter  if you have an efficientmarkets hypothesis you might expect them to persist  i mean it would be odd in the context of efficient markets if they predictably reversed in a timely way  we have some confidence that some of this effect persists but i guess i wouldnt want to hang my hat on saying absolutely that this entire effect persists  so that is the source of uncertainty there  i take this evidence together to suggest that the lsaps have worked  there has been some effect but it is very difficult to quantify no doubt 
chairman bernanke governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  brian in panel 19 you have plotted a possible path for the tapering down of the mbs purchases  if that is the path that you indeed follow do you have some even intuitive sense of a point along that path at which you would begin to feel relatively more confident that you werent going to see a significant effect on the markets from the tapering off of our purchases  i know that is tied up with the degree to which this is a flow effect 
mr sack i think it is useful regarding that question just to relate what we hear from the market participants who come through our door and talk to us about this  almost everyone thinks that mbs spreads are too low and are too low because of fed purchases  there is disagreement about the size of those effects but if you ask me to give you a range i would say that the range we hear is 25 to 100 basis points  my own view is that it is going to be much closer to the lower end of that but certainly that is hard to pin down 
the logical next question is to ask well if you think that why arent you shorting this and trying to take advantage of that  and the answer almost as uniformly is we are going to but we are just afraid to get into it yet while the fed is still so sizable so it is a very strange situation from a market perspective especially from those of us who think about the efficiency of markets  everyone is kind of waiting for this adjustment to take place and kind of waiting to jump in to try to take advantage of it  there is just a sense that it is too early 
my guess is that we are not talking about waiting until the end  there will be some arbitrage that if there is a flow effect is going to bring it forward  it would be a wild guess but i would say that it wouldnt be surprising to see something start to develop within the next two months as we get closer to that exit  i think when people assess their risks we havent heard anyone come and express the view that mortgages are cheap and that the spread is likely to go down so that kind of leaves you with this onesided opportunity that i think cant persist for that long 
mr tarullo okay thanks 
chairman bernanke other questions okay  seeing none we have three staff presentations on our liquidity programs and reservemanagement tools and i will turn to bill nelson to lead off 
mr nelson thank you mr chairman  i will briefly update the committee 
on the taf primary credit and the talf  the staff is not seeking views at this 
time but we would be happy to answer the committees questions
 
credit extended under the term auction facility peaked near 500 billion in march 
and has declined steadily since over the intermeeting period taf credit declined 
further to just under 140 billion  of that amount about threequarters is extended to 
branches and agencies of foreign banks  on september 24 the board announced a 
phasedown schedule for taf amounts through january and it also indicated that auctions of credit with maturities longer than 28 days would be phased out  in yesterdays auction of 70day taf funds the amount auctioned was cut to 25 billion half the october amount  only 132 billion was requested even though 43 billion is maturing  by january 11 2010 only 75 billion of 28day credit will be offered 
we do not expect to ask the board to make any decision about the taf in the near term  later this year or perhaps early next year the board will be asked to consider whether to further reduce the amount provided in taf auctions perhaps to zero reducing taf auction amounts to zero in the intermediate term would be consistent with the ongoing gradual normalization of federal reserve liquidity operations would ensure that no bank currently using the facility remained reliant on taf funding and would help reduce reserve balances during a period in which the fomc might be tightening policy  if auction amounts were reduced to zero the staff would work to preserve operational readiness by periodically conducting simulated auctions id emphasize that reducing taf credit to zero for a period would not imply that taf credit would necessarily be zero in the future steady state the options that policymakers might consider for a permanent taf currently seem likely to include using taf only as a tool for contingencies with no credit outstanding in normal times or conducting monthly auctions of relatively small amounts of credit to preserve readiness whether to have a permanent taf and if so in what form is an issue we expect to raise once the financial crisis has fully subsided 
turning to primary credit prior to the financial crisis the primary credit rate had been consistently set at a level 100 basis points over the target federal funds rate and the maximum available term of primary credit was overnight except for the smallest institutions which could borrow for up to one month  over the past two years the federal reserve narrowed the primary credit rate spread to 25 basis points and lengthened the maximum maturity to 90 days  the total amount of primary credit outstanding peaked near 115 billion in october 2008  it has since fallen to 23 billion of which more than 90 percent is to branches and agencies of foreign banks and twothirds is extended to a single foreign bank that is prohibited from term borrowing and is rolling overnight credit about 45 billion in primary credit had an initial maturity greater than 28 days and nearly all of that is to another foreign bank 
later this week the board will be asked to consider whether the maximum maturity on primary credit loans should be reduced to 28 days in january 2010  in this way the terms on primary credit would not be tightened until after yearend but then the maximum maturity of primary credit would be aligned with the maturity of taf loans the board and reserve banks could evaluate early next year the appropriate time to adjust the spread of the primary credit rate over the target rate and possibly to reduce further the maximum maturity on primary credit loans if reserve bank presidents have comments on the proposal to reduce the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 28 days please convey them directly to the board staff or to a member of the board in the next few days 
lastly i will provide a brief update on the talf  on october 5 the board announced two changes to the procedures for evaluating assetbacked securities pledged to the talf first the board requested public comment on a rule that would establish criteria for determining the credit rating agencies whose ratings on abs would be accepted at the facility the proposed criteria will most likely result in ratings from one additional agency being accepted starting with the january subscription second starting with the november subscription which takes place today the new york fed is conducting a formal risk assessment of all abs pledged to the facility the new riskassessment process has gone smoothly and eight abs with a total value of about 6 billion will be issued in conjunction with the november subscription 
in recent months spreads on most triplea auto and credit card abs have fallen well below the 100 basis point talf spread and abs are increasingly being funded by nontalf sources whereas in may through august talf lending equaled about twothirds of abs issuance in september it fell to onethird and in october to onequarter the proportion appears likely to fall further in november with less than 1 billion in talf loans for abs expected today  investors have now repaid over 20 percent of talf loans backed by abs contributing to a 10 percent decline in outstanding talf credit over the intermeeting period 
conditions in the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities are more mixed  spreads on cmbs in secondary markets have narrowed significantly but are still somewhat elevated and talf lending to finance purchases of legacy cmbs continues each month at fairly low levels  the newissue cmbs market remains closed but it now appears likely that a security which will be eligible for talf financing will be brought to market later this month  nathan will now continue the staff presentation 
mr sheets with the federal reserves temporary liquidity swap lines expected to expire on february 1 the staff has assessed the case for putting in place a set of standing swap lines based on this examination and as discussed in our background memo we recommend that the committee establish standing dollarliquidity and foreigncurrencyliquidity swap lines with the european central bank the bank of japan the bank of england and the swiss national bank  standing dollarliquidity lines would allow these central banks to access dollars while foreigncurrency lines would give the federal reserve the capacity to provide euros yen sterling and swiss francs to us institutions  these lines would be precautionary in nature and would be designed to serve as a backstop during times of stress  we would expect that during normal times the lines would not be used   
we propose that the limits on the new dollar lines be much smaller than those for the temporary lines30 billion each for the ecb and the boj and 15 billion each for the boe and snb this significant reduction in the size of the swap lines and in the number of counterparties from fourteen central banks to four would seem to provide a reasonable balance between the broad thrust of the committees exit strategies and the potential utility of these lines in periods of stress  for the standing foreigncurrency lines we propose that the sizes be comparable to those for the dollar lines which would also represent a significant downsizing 
as envisioned the lines would include sufficient governance features to ensure that any use of swap line resources was consistent with the objectives and intentions of the fomc for example the federal reserve could deny drawings to fund intervention in foreign exchange markets  establishment of the swap lines would require an initial vote of the fomc with each line requiring reauthorization by the fomc on an annual basis  initial disbursements under the lines could occur either under the supervision of the foreign currency subcommittee or require an additional vote of the full committee   
we see the case for a small set of standing lines as quite convincing  first through the rigors of the crisis the swap lines have proven useful in combating financial stresses  maintaining a small set of standing swap lines is the best way to ensure that the lines are fully operational when they are needed  the routine maintenance of standing facilities requires that technical expertise and operational apparatusboth at the federal reserve and at foreign central banksbe ready to activate at short notice in addition coordinating policy decisions with foreign central banks has the potential to be complicated and time consuming so its preferable to have as many as possible of these decisions negotiated in advance  thus we see the establishment of standing lines as being superior to just having documentation on the shelf  second even if the lines are never activated they should help foster confidence in the robustness of the international financial system and thus contribute positively to market functioning  third the swap lines have been a powerful symbol of central bank cooperation the decision to create standing lines would be seen as a signal that central banks intend to continue to work closely together fourth the crisis has dramatized the remarkable extent to which financial markets have become globally integrated the dollar swap lines expand the federal reserves capacity to address funding pressures abroad and thus help to prevent those pressures from spilling over to domestic markets  finally the swap lines foster an expectation that home central banks will be called on to make judgments about the financial health of their domestic institutions during times of stress  this should enhance central banks incentives to keep careful tabs on the activities of their large global institutions 
the rationale for establishing dollar swap lines with the ecb the bank of japan the bank of england and the swiss national bank is compelling given the large dollar funding markets and globally active financial institutions in their economies  and while we cannot perfectly foresee where or when us institutions might face foreigncurrency funding pressures extending the federal reserves capacity to act as a lender of last resort in euros yen sterling and swiss francs strikes us as prudent insurance against a range of potential adverse scenarios   
the decision to establish standing swap lines with only these four central banks will no doubt disappoint some of our other existing central bank counterparties  but our recent experience indicates that maintaining a larger network of swap lines exposes the federal reserve to recurring boundary problems  over the past year many foreign central banks have petitioned the federal reserve to establish temporary swap lines with them  given that we value our relationships with these central banks turning down such requests has at times put us in a difficult position  our proposal sets a very high bar for the establishment of standing swap lines which should minimize such difficulties in the future 
we propose that these lines be structured broadlyas the temporary lines have beenwith shortmaturity draws and safeguards to ensure that the credit risk to the federal reserve is nil in addition the pricing structure for the swap lines would be negotiated with an eye toward mitigating moral hazard by providing funds to institutions at a rate that is attractive during times of stress but not attractive during normal times  notably the pricing of the temporary dollar lines appears to have satisfied this objective total outstandings under these lines surged to over 580 billion in december 2008 as the crisis intensified but have since dropped to less than 35 billion as conditions have improved  we expect that the high bar for central bank counterparties and the smaller sizes of the lines will also limit the extent of moral hazard  of course if stresses emerge additional swap lines could be put in place and the size of the lines could be scaled up but there is no guarantee that the federal reserve and other central banks would actually choose to do so in any particular case 
the staff proposes that the standing lines become effective on the day that the temporary lines expire thus providing a seamless transition between the two types of lines given the continued healing in funding markets our working assumption is that the temporary swap lines will expire on february 1 as scheduled 
if the committee supports moving forward with standing swap lines the staff would immediately begin to negotiate the details of these arrangements with the foreign central banks the staff would then ask the committee to vote on a formal resolution at either the december or the january meeting depending on the pace of those negotiations and other developments  we anticipate that the creation of the standing swap lines would be publicly announced shortly following the meeting in which the resolution was approved we would of course keep the committee apprised of developments influencing this timetable as they evolve 
finally i turn to a brief discussion of our standing swap lines under the north american framework agreement nafa  these lines are relatively small sized at 3 billion for mexico and 2 billion for canada  the staff sees two broad approaches for dealing with these lines  the first is simply to leave them in place in their current form  given their relatively small size these lines are largely vestigial so the benefits and costs of maintaining them as is are both minimal   
another option would be to modernize these lineschanging their structure and legal documentation to match more closely those of our other standing lines  notably the nafa lines were established with the explicit purpose of promoting orderly conditions in foreign exchange markets and they have a relatively rigid pricing structure we would suggest refocusing the lines more directly on countering dollar funding pressures this could be done by making their pricing more flexible consistent with the broad principles discussed above and by increasing the sizes of the lines to say 8 billion or 10 billion  
 the following points argue for modernization  first the extent of north american integration provides a special justification for these lines and a rationale for treating canada and mexico differently from other countries  second our sense is that officials in these countries would welcome this approach and not enhancing the lines might strain our relationships with them  third it seems more orderly and transparent to have all our linesboth with the four foreign central banks and with our nafa counterpartiesstructured in a broadly similar way  fourth mexico already has an arrangement under the imfs flexible credit lines so the swap line would not be substituting for a relationship with the fund 
however we also note some reservations  first financial institutions in canada and mexico are not globally active in the same sense as institutions in the economies of our other four counterparties  second seeing that mexico has a swap line other emerging market economies might request lines as well  our substantial integration with mexico should provide persuasive responses to these requests but it might be better not to open this door at all  third the quality of mexicos economic and financial policies and the stability of its underlying institutions are not yet comparable to those of our four other counterparties or to canadas  on balance the staff leans toward a recommendation to modernize the nafa swap lines but this is admittedly a close call we envision that any enhancements to the nafa lines would be implemented on the same timetable as that for the other standing swap lines  chris burke will now continue our presentation 
mr burke thank you nathan jim clouse and i will now update the committee on staff work on reserve collateral accounts reserve repurchase agreements and term deposits  i will start with reserve collateral accounts 
under a reserve collateral account or rca a pair of institutionsa purchaser of funds generally a depository institution and a seller of funds typically a gse would set up a specialpurpose account at the federal reserve  the seller would have control of the movement of funds into and out of the account  the buyer would be required to hold the funds in the account and those funds would both collateralize the transaction and earn interest on excess reserves  the rca would eliminate the credit risk that would have been present in a fed funds sale transaction allowing lenders such as gses to deal with a greater number of counterparties and theoretically earn a higher interest rate with line limits becoming less of a constraint on gses funds sales the linkage between the interest rate on reserves and shorterterm rates should be tightened 
since the last fomc meeting we have discussed rcas in detail with two gses several depository institutions and the fdic  extrapolating from the feedback from freddie mac and the federal home loan bank of san francisco there may be broad interest from gses in lending funds using these accounts  the ability to mitigate counterparty risk and engage a wider range of counterparties to attain higher interest rates is understandably attractive to them  on the other hand the feedback from the depository institutions was mixed  some were interested in creating rcas some were indifferent and some were not in favor of the accounts  based on their collective comments the staff believes that it is possible that some banks would seek to purchase funds using these accounts primarily those banks that currently have higherthanaverage equitytoasset ratios and that do not now borrow from the gses  the estimated range of interest rates that would likely be negotiated for sales into rcas varied from a high of 5 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves to a low of 18 basis points below the ioer rate though one large money center bank expressed the view that it would not participate for a spread of less than 50 basis points 
one significant outstanding issue with rcas is how the fdic would treat funds in an rca in the event of a borrowers insolvency  in order for rcas to be viable sellers require clear guidance about the disposition of funds in an rca in this situation staff members at the fdic understand that point but have stated that further review is necessary we expect to hear back from the fdic this week 
at this point while it is likely that rcas could provide some benefits the effectiveness of this instrument in tightening our control of shortterm interest rates is difficult to forecast  moreover fully developing this instrument would divert staff members from critical work on term deposits and reverse repos  because the fomc has placed a strong emphasis on the development of those two tools the staff recommends that efforts on rcas be put on hold until the other tools are closer to fruition 
turning to reverse repos given the successful testing of triparty reverse repos with the primary dealers and clearing banks that has taken place over recent weeks the desk now has the capability to settle reverse repurchase agreements in the triparty system with primary dealers using soma treasury and agency debt securities as collateral  that said the desk recommends that this tool be used in a series of small realvalue operations to have full confidence that all operational details have been addressed before reverse repos are deployed in size  the reason is that the tests run to date while effective do not allow for complete endtoend testing  one possibility would be for the desk to conduct a 360 million operation the week of november 16 and a series of operations the week of november 30 that would not exceed 14 billion in aggregate at any one time  it would be very important to communicate to market participants that these smallscale operations are merely an aspect of the ongoing testing and do not signal that a firming of monetary policy is imminent  such communication could come from the desk rather than the fomc to sharpen this distinction in particular the desk could announce the smallscale operations in the form of an operating statement similar to the one issued on october 19 
the work just described applies only to reverse repos with primary dealers using treasury and agency debt securities as collateral  work continues on establishing the triparty reverse repo capability using agency mbs securities as that has several complicating dimensions to it  we are still some weeks away from finalizing a plan with the clearing banks our mbs custodian and our investment manager and it may then take some months to implement the plan  a second set of realvalue tests may prove useful in early 2010 when the capability to reverse out agency mbs securities is expected to become available 
a broader issue regarding reverse repurchase agreements is determining the appropriate set of counterparties for the desk  the primary dealers tend to be net borrowers of funds rather than net providers which makes them unnatural counterparties for reverse repos moreover there is currently no means for dealers to borrow collateral from the fed and then reverse out that collateral to cash providers without grossing up their balance sheets and affecting their leverage ratios  as a consequence the current capacity of the primary dealer community to enter into reverse repos with the fed is limited  based on a desk survey of all the primary dealers and a survey conducted by the treasury market practices group tmpg system capacity appears to be in the range of 100 billion to 250 billion 
the staff continues to explore options to expand reverse repo capacity either by enabling the dealers to participate to a greater extent or by expanding our counterparties dealer capacity might be expanded in a number of ways including the use of a netting facility such as the fixed income clearing corporations general collateral finance repo facility which would allow the dealers to net their reverse repos with the fed with their matching repos with the cash investors and thus keep these transactions off their balance sheets  it is too soon to tell if any of these approaches will bear fruit  in terms of providing regulatory relief for balance sheet concerns the news is not encouraging  dealers have identified a host of constraints meaning that there is no single solution for example seven dealers have bank holding company tier1 leverage ratio concerns nine dealers have homecountry constraints including france switzerland the united kingdom canada and japan and most dealers noted concerns regarding how credit rating agencies and market analysts would perceive an increase in balance sheet assets and leverage  although solutions to these constraints may exist many agencies both foreign and domestic would have to coordinate responses as a result this avenue does not appear to offer much hope of relief in the short term 
while we continue to pursue primary dealer capacity enhancements we have also begun to explore issues surrounding expanding reverse repo counterparties beyond the primary dealers  we have performed an initial survey of the major cash providers the largest of which include the money market mutual funds securities lenders and custodians banks governmentsponsored entities and foreign central banks several of these types of firms have characteristics that make them appealing counterparties the main issue however may be related to the number of desk counterparties and the logistics of putting a system in place in a timely manner 
for practical reasons the desk prefers to set up a system in which it interacts with a limited set of large firms  this would allow us to expand capacity significantly and relatively quickly for example based on our very preliminary exploration we can identify two dozen firms spanning the categories listed above that currently lend more than 1 trillion in funds on a shortterm basis with a sizable portion of that taking place in repo markets  it would be feasible to set up fairly quickly the systems and arrangements needed to transact with those firms giving us all the capacity we need 
if the desk must instead provide an opportunity for small firms to participate in these operations the logistics of counterparty vetting and trading would likely become overwhelming as the federal reserve has neither the systems nor the manpower to reach out to hundreds or thousands of potential cash investors  thus before continuing work on the subject the desk would like to solicit guidance from the committee on the approach to expanding counterparties  with such guidance we will be able to continue to explore potential counterparties with a greater degree of specificity ill now turn it over to jim to discuss term deposits 
mr clouse thanks chris i will be discussing progress on the term deposit facility or tdf under which the federal reserve would have the capability to offer term deposits to depository institutions as a means of reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system work on the tdf has been proceeding along three important dimensionsfurther developing systems and preparing for implementation drafting key documents including a federal register notice and a legal agreement for term deposits and evaluating alternative designs for the tdf  ill briefly summarize progress in each of these three areas in turn and conclude with a discussion of next steps 
the implementation workgroupwhich includes reserve bank representatives from various system communities including legal reserves accounting creditrisk and customer supporthas been overseeing the steps necessary to position the system to implement the tdf in the first quarter of next year  last weekend the automation development teamafter months of hard workdeployed a webbased application that allows depositories to submit bids or subscription orders for term deposits via a secure internet connection  the application supports both posted rate offerings and auction offerings  in coming months the implementation team will be coordinating work across the system on the remaining steps necessary to implement a term deposit facility such as formulating procedures for issuing electronic credentials to access the tdf and developing a communications plan  
the staff has also made substantial progress in developing two key documents that will be necessary before a term deposit facility can be implemented  a system legal group has produced a draft agreement for term deposits that would be signed by participating institutions in addition the staff has developed a draft federal register notice that provides background on the proposed tdf and seeks comment from the public on a number of key design features  the federal register notice could be published this month if desired 
the design workgroup has developed some basic structures for a term deposit 
facility  the core design issues involve the type of deposit to be offeredfixed rate 
versus floating rateand the mechanism by which deposits would be offered
 through an auction or simply by posting a rate or rates  beyond these key design 
parameters there are a number of related technical questions such as the appropriate 
maturities of term of deposits whether to allow an early withdrawal option and if so 
at what penalty and whether deposits can be pledged as collateral at the discount 
window at present the staffs sense is that term deposits would have relatively short 
maturities likely ranging between two weeks and three months  our current thinking 
is that early withdrawal would not be allowed given that the objective of a tdf is to 
drain reserves on the other hand it seems appropriate that banks should be able 
pledge term deposits as collateral at the window especially if early withdrawal is not 
allowed and the staff is working to ensure that such pledging can be done in an 
automated fashion  the proposed federal register notice would seek public 
comment on all of these basic design questions 

the staff anticipates that it will propose going out for public comment on the term
 deposit facility with a 30day comment period  the results from the public comments 
would then inform decisions about the final structure for a term deposit facility  on a 
parallel track the implementation group will be coordinating work with reserve 
banks and various system groups to be in position to implement any of several 
potentially desirable structures for the tdf in the first quarter of next year 

chairman bernanke thank you we are open for questions from the committee  please hold your comments and input just for a few more minutes and we will have a chance for that as well  but any questions for the staff  president lacker  
mr lacker i was going to ask mr sheets about the rough magnitude of the dollar reserves held by the four central banks that you are proposing we establish swap lines with 
mr sheets we dont have a precise number given some reporting issues for the euro system which would include all of the ncbs plus the ecb but those dollar reserves are somewhere on the order of about 150 billion to 160 billion  for the boj its a bit over 800 billion they were very very substantial holders of dollar reserves  for the bank of england its roughly on the order of 15 billion and for the swiss national bank its around 23 billion 
mr lacker okay is a lot of that held with cbias in new york or do they have their own arrangements for buying assets 
mr sheets im not quite sure   
ms mosser most central banks have accounts with us  very few central banks hold all of their reservesfor very few central banks we are the custodian for all of their reserves  they almost all have additional custody relationships in addition to cbias 
mr lacker so operationally how would a foreign central bank selling dollar reserves in order to lend dollars to one of their banks compare with the operational requirements of obtaining dollars through one of these swap lines and lending them on for operational convenience how would those two compare 
mr sheets it seems to me that the major difference is that in the one case they would have to sell off their holdings of government securities which if you are thinking that this might occur during a period of stress could be unsettling to the government securities market  what these swap lines do is allow these foreign central banks to have access to dollar liquidity without actually asking them to liquefy their reserves 
mr lacker and these are dollar reserves  so if they are selling off government assets these are probably treasuries 
mr sheets these are probably treasuries  thats what i was referring to  it may be that during a period of stress you dont want them to be selling off their treasuries  that could be disruptive to the market 
mr lacker dont treasury security prices usually go up during times of stress 
mr sheets that has been our experience over the last crisis absolutely  but do you want to bet that in every state of nature thats the way its going to be you know there are risks and we dont know which way foreign preferences will go toward treasuries at some future time 
mr lacker we heard earlier that a huge amount of the primary credit facility borrowers are foreign banks does the borrowing through these swap lines occur by banks that dont have access to our primary credit facility 
mr sheets my understanding is that its some of both 
mr lacker so there are some institutions that could borrow from us directly and they borrow either instead or also through 
mr sheets through the swap lines given the pricing structure of the swap lines getting funds through the swap lines has been relatively expensive  so if they have had a choice they havent gone to the swap lines 
mr lacker so one of these banks that is borrowing directly from us could lend it on to one of these others banks couldnt they 
mr sheets through the interbank market 
mr lacker okay 
mr sheets i would assume so 
ms mosser i dont believe that certainly during the crisis that was actually what happened in practice what i think is particularly true of european institutions is that they were borrowing in the united states and then moving the cash to their homes  the us subsidiary was sending it basically to the parent and they were not lending it on to other institutions in europe they were using it in their own parent institutions   
mr lacker i see one final question when you refer to funding pressures you are not talking about the overall supply and demand of reserves  you are talking about individual institutions that have to pay up in the market 
mr sheets thats right their capacity to be able to go into the market and access reserves obviously there is a price component to that  but as we saw through the last crisis as the interbank market came under stress the volume of transactions also dried up  so i think that in addition to a price component there was a rationing going on in the market as well 
mr lacker but i guess my point was that this doesnt do anything for the overall supply of reserves in the market that discount window lending or open market operations wouldnt do it just facilitates channeling those reserves to particular institutions that would otherwise face high counterparty creditrisk premiums 
mr sheets right and in particular maybe some institutions that may not have access to our domestic facilities  nevertheless as you recall early on in the crisis these guys were coming into the money markets in new york and creating volatility through their demands for dollar funding in particular early in the day they were demanding huge quantities of liquidity and driving up the rate and then the rate would crash at the end of the day  but it was making vice chairman dudleys job extremely difficult  so there are important spillover effects for us and we point to this as one of the major reasons that it is important to maintain the capacity to provide dollar liquidity to foreign markets 
mr sack another dimension from the perspective of policymakers is that even though some firms can substitute between getting dollar funding here through our facilities and getting it abroad by providing a dollar swap and allowing the foreign central bank to provide the dollar liquidity they rather than the fed are bearing the credit risk of the facility 
chairman bernanke vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley that is what i was going to say   
chairman bernanke all right 
ms mosser one final commenti also think about the realities of collateral  the fact is that large global financial institutions have collateral at almost all the large central banks  moving that collateral on short notice particularly in the midst of a crisis from one central bank to another in order to make sure that you have collateral and you can borrow in the right currency is very timeconsuming  it does not happen quickly  there is work afoot to make that movement of collateral around the world smoother but it isnt there yet  and the swap arrangements like the comparison of moving collateral around basically put the counterparty risk as brian noted frankly where it belongs and also allowed the collateral to be used at the central bank that is actually bearing the counterparty risk and not moved around and needing to be reevaluated by another central bank 
mr lacker just one more little followup  do we know whether the difference between rates paid last fall in the early part of the day by foreign banks and rates paid after they ceased participating in the market which were lower reflected market segmentation across the day or higher creditrisk premiums if they were paid   
chairman bernanke vice chairman do you want to answer that 
vice chairman dudley i think our feeling at the time president lacker was that it was due to the fact that there was a structural dollar shortage in europe  so there was a strong timeofday effect  it wasnt just a counterpartyrisk issue 
chairman bernanke president lockhart you were next 
mr lockhart this is not on this particular question but tois it chris burke did i hear that correctly 
mr burke yes 
mr lockhart help me with connecting the dots at a high level here  i took your overall discussion of the reverse repo market to be sort of discouraging on netnear term at leastthat we have obstacles various technical challenges that are building up and that it is far from certain that this is going to be a largecapacity drainer of excess reserves  then i look at the markets view of this question in exhibit 26 and it appears that they are ranking the reverse repos as the largest possible drainer of reserves  are we building here to a disconnect between the reality of this tool and what the market thinks this tool can do and therefore a schism between public views of our ability to drain and what we can really accomplish 
mr burke i think it is a sense of timing  we have collateral  we have the ability to reverse out our treasury and agency collateral today  even without agency mbs we could have a program of 800 billion from a collateral perspective  the primary dealers though as noted are limited to something maybe more in the 200 billion range  but that does mean that today we have 200 billion in capacity and i think its going to depend on the committees answer to the counterparty discussion if we can deal with a small number of large firms in very short order i think we can bring the capacity of this tool to at least match the level of collateral that we have to reverse out 
mr lockhart if we gave you an answer today how long do you think it would take you to be in a position to do a largescale program that approaches that collateral level of 800 billion 
mr burke a very preliminary guess might be somewhere in the yearend time frame  we have the legal infrastructure in place  we have the authority to deal with the counterparties so its a question of logistically arrangingdoing the vetting of the individual counterparties i think would be the biggest chunk of work there  we can already identify a superlarge wellknown money fund as having a lot of cash to invest  they already deal with triparty we can already work in triparty  we have the authority to deal with that firm so it is getting in and doing the credit review the regulatory review and saying okay we are good to go and then we can be investing or taking money from them in reverse repo transactions  so i think in fairly short order if we have to cast a wider net for counterparties though its going to be a very different ballgame   
mr lockhart this may not be a question for chris but is this coming to a question soon 
mr burke well i think the intent in my presentation at least at my level was to put the question on the table  i am not sure of the formalities 
chairman bernanke we will make a list of what input is desired and then we will ask everyone president plosser 
mr plosser i just had a followup to the answer that nathan gave on the intraday volatility that you referred to in terms of reserves  to what degree was that also the creation of our own operating proceduresthat we were going into the market only once a day and we were reluctant to be players on a continuous basis  could we have solved some of that problem by our own operating procedures and being in the market more continuously 
vice chairman dudley part of the problem is that we never have had knowledge of how much reserves we actually did need to add during the day because we dont have a real sense of whether the banking system has the appropriate amount of reserves so you could respond multiple times during the day but end up adding way too many reserves or adding 
mr plosser is that because we were targeting quantities rather than prices  once again could we have been closer had we been more frequent 
vice chairman dudley there was also an operational issuelate in the day the market gets much thinner  so there is also a timing issue in that the later you go in the day the lessyou know the money market business is a morning business  but yes you could have conceivably tried to do more 
mr plosser  i was just reacting to your saying that was one of the major reasons we want to have this  in some ways we could have done some things on our own to help mitigate some of that i guess 
vice chairman dudley  i think our feeling at the time was that we were not confident that multiple interventions during the day would have actually helped us hit the target better 
mr lacker a twohander 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker  these observations are from preioer  the operation he is talking about is soaking up reserves late in the day which is exactly what the interest rate on reserves has done  it is not clear that this would be a big problem 
chairman bernanke president fisher 
mr fisher  on the talf as we go through more auctions more subscriptions is there any incidence of refinancing previous talf loans  and if so how much and what does it tell us 
mr nelson we do extend some talf loans for seasoned abs  i guess its conceivable that those abs had previously been borrowed against and then resold into the market or they were issued as talfeligible and not taken up in the first round  however off the top of my head i do not know the amount that is being extended against seasoned abs 
mr fisher  do you think it is significant  can we find out 
mr nelson  certainly yes ill get that to you 
mr fisher  it may just be that rates are increasingly attractive  i dont know but i would be curious as to how much recycling is taking place 
chairman bernanke vice chair 
mr kohn i thought the trend was that people were actually paying back the talf loans 
mr fisher  no thats true in the aggregate  so im just asking the question 
mr kohn rather than refinancing them theyre actually paying them back and doing better in the market than they can do at the federal reserve 
mr fisher  thats true in the aggregate 
mr nelson  theyre not refinancing their loans but theyre paying them back  that collateral is freeing up and conceivably could come back into the facility which is what i thought you were asking 
mr fisher  right   
mr nelson but the overall amount of lending is just dropping very rapidly  this month its going to be between 600 million and 1 billion i think  so there just is not a lot of scope for very much activity along those lines given how quickly activity under the facility has quieted down 
mr fisher  thanks 
chairman bernanke president bullard 
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  this is a question about swap lines  i like the memo and i like the approach  the policy of discontinuing the swap lines with certain central banksim not quite sure where that leaves us because it seems as though now that when we get into another crisis the presumption would be that we would reestablish those lines with those banks since we did so this time around  so im not quite sure how to place your description of what we are doing here in that context because i think that there would certainly be overwhelming pressure in another crisis of this magnitude to reestablish those swap lines  then you would have the difficulty of having to as you say renegotiate and set up the details as you did this time  so im wondering what you think about that as opposed to the idea that we are pulling back and were maybe implicitly saying that we may not reestablish with say south korea or other countries like that in the future  whats your thinking on that 
mr sheets  a couple of thoughts  your general point is well taken  on the first point in terms of the pulling back the scaling and so on and so forth our view is that we need to have a certain small number of swap lines in order to have the operational capacity to understand how they work to have thought through all of the legal issues and also to have a good sense from the committee and from other central banks as to what the appropriate policy objectives of these things are but from that relatively small set if conditions require its usually fairly easy to scale it out  so im not worried about if we only have four and then the world blows up and we want to have fourteen again whether it is going to be harder to go from four to fourteen  no i would be worried about going from zero to four however  ten years from now the folks in new york who did all the work may be onto other things or other positions and just as was the case in this last episode we had to run around and pretty much figure these things out from scratch i actually think that trish has a few purple hearts that she earned in that process  
now the flip side of this is that we gave them a swap line once and if things get bad were going to give them a swap line again  i think that is a very reasonable presumption if a crisis erupts in a year or two years  but if the next crisis is eight or ten years out there is a lot of water under the bridge the world looks a lot different and its not clear to me that there is the same presumption  now the committee at that point may want to look at it and come to the conclusion that yes we want to give korea another swap line but i do not think there would be as strong a presumption as if they actually had a swap line with us 
so i do think there is some meaning in where we draw this set of counterparties  as i mentioned in my remarksbut it is an important pointit is also very helpful to us in managing our relationships with foreign central banks from here until the time of the next crisis  on yes 
mr nelson could i add another piece of information for president fisher  the repayment of talf loans has been concentrated in the plainvanilla shortmaturity abs where secondary market spreads have come down the most  autos credit cards equipment abs to a lesser extent because those spreads are now well below the talf loan rateand for example in the current subscription that is going on today there was no request at all for talf loans against the auto abs that were issuedit strikes me as pretty unlikely that a very large part of the talf lending thats going on now is going to finance abs that have already been paid back  those would have appreciated in price and their spreads would now be too narrow to be attractive to finance under the talf 
mr fisher  thank you 
chairman bernanke other questions  president lacker 
mr lacker yes about the liquidity swap lines that would enable us to lend foreign currency to our institutions and some other countries  my recollection is that those were motivatedi wont say primarily but largelyby one large institution  at the time it seemed correct me if im wrong if the reasoning goes in a different waypreferable to the long and arduous task of encouraging through supervisory means that the institution find other foreign currency liquidity sources on which it could rely and reduce the extent of maturity transformation that it conducted in foreign currencies  so i was wondering if progress has been made on supervisory efforts to encourage that institution to reduce its vulnerability to maturity transformation in other currencies 
mr sheets i dont have specific information about that institution the motivation for this proposal however is much broader and more generic than a single institution  our expectation is that these lines wouldnt be used anytime soon  we do not have a single institution in mind  but we do have a generic class of problems in mind in which you have a us institution that is operating abroad that for some reason has either difficulty in mobilizing its collateral to use at the foreign central banks window or a real possibility that the foreign central bank is unwilling to lend to an institution with legitimate collateral  we have had conversations with various central banks one in particularwhen they have said that under certain circumstances they wouldnt be willing to lend to our institutions  so these are very precautionary in nature but i think that they respond to a real class of problems that it makes sense for us to take out some insurance against 
chairman bernanke other questions trish 
ms mosser  may i make one more comment to president lacker  although not mentioned specifically in the memo it is probably worth remembering that the first time that liquidity swaps were used was on september 12 and september 13 2001  so there are other circumstances for having these kinds of facilities in place and in the case of the reverse lines particularly should there be some sort of catastrophic event in another large financial center where our ability to basically do broad distribution of foreign currency not just to specific institutions might be useful  we didnt really discuss that here but we know that it has been done at least once the other way 
chairman bernanke okay the next item on the agenda is billed as an opportunity for interactionlaughter a way of saying that we dont necessarily want to have a goround  we do have two subsequent gorounds  everyone will have a chance to give their views  however this is an opportunity both to interact with each other and to give comments and feedback to the staff on the issues that theyve raised  so that people know what you would like to hear let me just go through that quickly  as i understand it there are no formal actions proposed for today is that right 
mr sheets  thats right 
chairman bernanke okay but mr burke you would like to hear some views on the counterparty issue anything else that you would like to hear from the committee 
mr burke  actually we want to affirm if we can the plan to put rcas on hold until we get the reverse repos and term deposits more fully squared away  we would like approval to do some small realvalue test operations of the reverse repos and if we are going to do that maybe the ability to issue another operating statement similar to the one on october 19 
chairman bernanke that would be i think implied 
mr burke but the last one as you mentioned is on counterparties whether we can create a system by which we can select a small number of large firms to transact with or whether we need to cast a wide net and allow small firms to participate 
chairman bernanke mr clouse  anything from you 
mr clouse the staff is proposing a federal register notice potentially this month for design input on the term deposits  it would be helpful to hear whether thats a desirable thing or not 
chairman bernanke bill anything 
mr nelson the only nearterm decision that were asking of the board in the next few days is on the maximum maturity of the primary credit rate  but if the presidents have views on that issue if they could convey that directly to a staff member or to a governor over the coming days outside this meeting that would be best  the other issues are ones for coming months or early next year and i suppose that views expressed on those as well would be valuable now  those have to do with in the intermediate term the scalingback of the taf to possibly zero in the first half of next year and also the eventual adjustment to the return to normalization of the terms of primary credit  again both of those things are decisions that would be made next year 
chairman bernanke okay and nathan you want comments on the swap proposal 
mr sheets right  particularly the counterparties the size and how to handle the north american swaps with mexico and canada 
mr kohn mr chairman scott is straining at his chair there 
mr alvarez yes the matters that bill nelson just brought up and the matters that jim clouse brought up on the federal register are matters that will eventually come to the board for its decision  so if the presidents want to express some views that the board should consider when the board is formally presented with those matters that could be helpful but they are not matters for the board to discuss in todays meeting 
chairman bernanke all right  there are too many items here  we are not going to have a quasidecision process here  okay so we will poll the committeecan we do thatand get feedback from everybody  if you havent had time to think about these issues we will get back to you after the meeting and get feedback on the relevant issues and we wont take a decision until we hear  but i would still like to have an opportunity for people who would like to make arguments or comments on any of these issues to do so now  president hoenig 
mr hoenig  just a suggestion  it would be helpful to me given the breadth of choices among us if there was following this meeting a onepage summary of each list of questions and then id feel much more comfortable responding to that after some thought than to try to give an answer at this point 
chairman bernanke brian would that be possible 
mr madigan yes 
chairman bernanke all right nevertheless we could have any interaction discussion comments or input anyone would like to have at this point on any of these issues  anyone  governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  a couple of points not on the board matters scott on chriss points i think the small number of large firms is consistent with the way we do primary dealers but i do think it is important to have criteria that can be easily justified about why we are doing a small number of large firms  i mean in this case we are borrowing money right rather than lending it 
mr burke right 
mr kohn right so its not clear that the risk of the counterparty is the right criterion but it could be the size that you can execute in and the speed with which you can execute  i think you just need to be very clear on the criteria so that its easily defensible when people say why arent you doing it with every small person who wants to lend us money 
i think putting the rcas on hold is a good idea  they always seemed very complicated to me and potentially bifurcating the fed funds market and i think that if we can get it done without that change we should  maybe we need them but i think putting them on hold is a good idea and concentrating on the reverse rps and the term deposits is the right way to go  i would be fine with a small realvalue test with the rate thing 
on the swaps this is more difficult  i think the swaps were a very very useful instrument in the recent crisis and it wasnt just about particular institutions  it has come down to that i think as the crisis unwinds it has come down to that both in our domestic facilities and in our international facilities  but at the height of the crisis there was a generalized demand for dollar funding that the markets were unable to meet because there was segmentation  there was a lack of arbitrage  there was a hoarding of liquidity  and the swapsparticularly once they got to be open endedwere very very important in both relieving pressure on the markets and building confidence 
i like the idea that the home country central bank is in charge of the lending for the most part  thats where the problems are going to be  thats where the fiscal issues are going to arise  so to the extent that the home country central bank can do the lending thats a benefit  and i think the point implied by president lacker about reserves is a good one but the problem with relying on reserves is that there is a limited amount of reserves that any particular central bank has and i know in talking to people from the ecb a problem they had was mobilizing the reserves in the various national central banks 
so i think the idea of this swap facility was very very useful  its important that we have something that is ready to activate on short notice and that we keep the machinery oiled at least for a small number of central banks the big four that nathan talked about  and i guess in theory that standby lines will do that  there could be some sort of contingency facility that you also tested on a periodic basis  in some sense im indifferent about how it is done but i think it is important to have it there 
i am much more torn about the mexican swap line to tell the truth  i worry about emerging market swap lines  i worry that well have to get into the business of judging whether the underlying policies in that country are good  in this case we had a generalized demand for dollars all over the world  so smearing the dollars all over the world was a good way of dealing with that  the next crisis could be more particular to an individual economy  president hoenig and i were in mexico about two weeks ago and it was quite striking i think tom that the mexicans as well as the visitors thought that it was a pretty troubled economy with lots of problems  i guess im worried that well get involved in something that is particular to mexico rather than a general dollar liquidity shortage  i recognize that the mexican economy as well as the canadian economy is deeply integrated with oursit is in our interest that it not be destabilized in some sense 
it would be important as i think nathan mentioned in his briefing to come back to the fomc before any of these swap lines are activated for the first time  i would not delegate it to the three of us on the subcommittee  i would want the fomc to do it and i think we need to be careful about how we specify the criteria under which the swap lines would be activated in the material that backs it up that somehow we make it clear that if there is a very specific problem keyed to the specific economy other ways of dealing with itthrough the imf the administration the congress if the united states is going to provide support in that caseare more appropriate than using the federal reserve bypassing those other channels  i am still a little concerned about the mexican part of this thing 
chairman bernanke vice chairman you had a twohander 
vice chairman dudley  i had more than a twohander 
chairman bernanke oh okay  one moment  i just wanted to say on the counterparties that theres not any particular reason that this cant be done in stages  i think its important that we have an open process and criteria and so on but given the exigencies of trying to get this up and running in a reasonable amount of time why cant we just do the ones that meet certain criteria in terms of size and capacity and so on first and then as we did with the talf for example go on to a broader set of counterparties  i just raise that possibility  okay vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley  thank you  on the counterparty issue i guess the question i have would be will there really be much interest by smaller counterparties given that giving funds to us is not really different from giving funds to the us treasury in the tbill market  its not as though we have a very special thing here thats going to be particularly attractive to small investors  so it seems to me that we want to find out how much interest there is before we design a very complicated mechanism that might or might not be of interest to them  and i would reinforce the chairmans view that theres no reason if there is an interest that you couldnt go to the large ones first and then broaden it out over time  i think its very clear that you want to be able to have the capacity to go largeto president lockharts point earlierand if you cant do a lot of money then this is really a bit of an illusion in terms of its effectiveness 
let me just go through the other ones very quickly  rcas on hold i agree with that  i think cash operations realvalue operations make sense  we just have to be very clear that its just a test  as far as mexico is concerned i share a lot of governor kohns concerns about going from generalized market problems to countryspecific problems  one way to get around that might be to require that mexico continue to be rated investmentgrade  i think theyre tripleb plus  so if they were to drop below that then you could argue that youre really morphing from something thats more into a countryrisk issue obviously the issue i think you are raising governor kohn is the issue of our getting involved in true credit risk with a sovereign entity and thats something that i think we should be very uncomfortable about if we really think that is above a meaningful threshold  other than that i think the four counterpartiesthe ecb the snb the bank of japan and the bank of englandmake perfect sense to keep in practice and i think the counterpartyrisk issues there are pretty negligible 
chairman bernanke president fisher did you have a twohander   
mr fisher well on the subject of mexico i think it is a difficult subject when you include canada in the equation clearly canada is a highergrade economy and would have a higher investment grade  but again we think of them all as north america  i have no problem with the four if we think through this nafa issue there are delicate politics when you deal with mexico because you are also dealing with canada simultaneously  so i would just ask you to bear that in mind  i think vice chair dudleys proposal may be a way to slice that but the answer may be to leave it untouched the 3 billion and the 2 billion  right now we have 3 billion to mexico and 2 billion to canada  and i would just point that out 
like tom hoenig i would like to have time to think about the other questions  but i just wanted to point that out  it is a very delicate issue not because i am a texan but just because of the nature of the agreement that we forged with these two countries as trading partners  so maybe the answer there is to leave it alone  but you cant treat one without offending the other 
chairman bernanke you will have time to think about the issues  governor warsh 
mr warsh  sure let me just add to what sounds like maybe a growing chorus on the currency swaps  i certainly favor the currency swaps  with the four central banks in terms of the size it strikes me that it should be just big enough to be a useful wellpracticed engine on both sides and frankly i dont know whether it needs to be as big as in the proposal to accomplish that objective  if we found ourselves in a crisis we could always amplify those to a greater extent so in some ways i wonder whether the numbers that were proposed were in an ambiguous world large enough that it is certainly more than some kind of testing program but not large enough to make a huge difference in the context of a global financial panic  i dont have better numbers in mind but i think the idea of being operational with those four makes sense 
with respect to the nafa issue i think it would probably make the most sense for us to let the temporary swaps extinguish on their own accord in february and put the new swaps in accord with the four and then sometime later after we are done hearing pleadings from the singaporeans and the koreans then decide what we want to do in the context of this nafa piece but i wouldnt want to conflate that issue with the swap line because that in some ways begs the question with the koreans in particular from whom we hear quite a bit 
with respect to the reverse repo issue and the small banks i guess this is really a question for chris burke and for bill dudley and the team which is would there be a large financial institution that would be willing to do the work on this for us  to see whether they would be responsible for a fee for aggregating the small institutions verifying their interest in whether they in aggregate could be of some real use given what we are trying to accomplish  because if i think about the relative scarcity of our resources it could potentially be a good piece of business for someone and that someone might not be us 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker yes on the swap lines i have never been a real big fan of these  my affection rose slightly earlier in the year but it was a transitory rise laughter i find my enthusiasm waning  basically i dont think they solve an economic problem worth solving  we have dollars out there and maybe i am just really sanguine about the ability of the system to move dollars around i guess at the end of the day that might be where we differ  it has the disadvantage of our having to police other central banks use of the funds and not let them do foreign exchange with them and all  so broadly speaking i wouldnt favor it because i think we can maintain the operational capability without the authorization for these things  i think we can practice these things some way or another  i think we can manage to maintain our human capital 
on the foreign currency swaps where we borrow a foreign currency in order to lend to one of our institutions i think at this time horizon nine months down the road the vulnerability of any of these institutions because of maturity transformation in a foreign currency is entirely endogenous it is entirely the choice of how they run their business and i dont think there is any excuse at this horizon not to have pushed them out of the nest  i dont know the details of these institutions but i think we ought to be working toward pushing them to run their business in a way that they are not so vulnerable to that 
as for the nafa things i think those are classic foreign exchange  its a vestige of our classic foreign exchange currency swap things that we have always opposed  they are really fiscal policiesthe same reasons that vice chairman dudley articulated 
i am glad to hear that rcas are on hold  i didnt think they were worth pursuing and they seemed to benefit mainly the gses  as for the other things i think a question we want to ask ourselves before this is what sense of urgency do we really feel about reverse rps and term deposits  i was struck by that chart that brian showed us and the new section at the end of the bluebook that discusses a sequence of potential statements that we could use for the exit  i was struck that they placed primary reliance on these two mechanisms for draining reserves and held asset sales in abeyance i would like to have the committee really grapple with that  i dont know why we wouldnt go to asset sales first  if our balance sheet were as small as it would be lets say nine months from now without these deposits would we issue a bunch of deposits to buy mbs i dont think we would do that i dont know why we would avoid selling mbs over the near term as we want to scale back reserve balances  i think we ought to grapple with just how much urgency these things require before we go public and get everybody all excited about them 
chairman bernanke well it seems as though more tools are better than fewer tools 
mr lacker i understand the more tools part but here we are at the threshold wherei mean we have already tickled their fancy in the financial markets  and before we go too much farther down the road i am not sure we shouldnt think of these as the backstop and asset sales as the primary tool 
chairman bernanke vice chairman   
vice chairman dudley i just had one very quick interjection  one of the values of the whole foreign exchange swap program during the crisis was not the swaps per se or the dollars that were extended but was the international policy coordination signal that was sent  it is really hard to quantify the value of that but i think it was actually very helpful to perceptions that central banks around the world recognize that this is a global crisis and responded collectively  i think that actually was helpful 
chairman bernanke president plosser 
mr plosser i guess i will start with swaps because that seems to be popular  i share a lot of the concerns actually that governor kohn had  don i thought i understood you to say that your inclination which i would agree with is that it is fine to keep these things on the shelf but you dont necessarily want to delegate it to the foreign currency subcommittee to make the decisions each time that it really ought to come back   
mr kohn for the first draw 
mr plosser for the first draw i found the argument in the memo a little strange about the transparency issuethat we wouldnt want to have it appear in the minutes that this was voted on and i find that sort of antitransparency which i wasnt sure i found very compelling 
the other thing i think about the swaps is that as president lacker was asking many of these banks do have lots of dollars at their disposal  okay  given that i would think one proper way to think about this may be that we would like them to use their own dollars as their first line of defense rather than coming to us  i dont know whether that really makes sense whether we could price this in a way that would make that a sensible strategy or whether it is even a desirable strategy in some sense because if these things were operational on a continuous basis would this be a kind of no questions asked way for them to request dollars or is it only reserved for crises  so id like to put their dollars on the line first and im not exactly sure how we would do that i dont mind having these things on the shelf and ready to go and operationalized i am a little concerned about the usage and whose dollars come first  and i think putting the rcas on hold is fine 
the other aspect is something that president lacker returned to which is the term deposits and the rps i kind of share his view in that i am not sure we have the tools in the right order at least as suggested by some of the staff discussion  but one question i had about the term deposits was if the term deposits are eligible for collateral at the discount window a bank could have a term deposit and turn around and post it as collateral at the discount window and borrow taking out shortterm reserves again  it seems as though they would undo the term deposit by doing that so what is the point of having the term deposit if they can turn around and undo it this way 
chairman bernanke the discount rate is higher than the term deposit rate 
mr plosser so that interacts with how much that discount rate varies but they would be willing to pay something to get that reversed  it almost makes these things tradable at a fixed price for shortterm reserves right  and so how do we control or would we control that in terms of this conversion  it seems as though we are defeating part of the purpose by doing that 
mr clouse yes im sorry there are lots of complications obviously  i think to your point if they were eligible for collateral that would presume that the primary credit rate was substantially above the ioer rate for example so that there wouldnt be an incentive for them to use these particular classes of assets as collateral at the discount window to undo exactly the operation and of course they have to worry not only about the spread but also any nonpecuniary 
mr plosser well suppose they did it today posted the collateral at the discount window and went to the taf auction and borrowed 28day money for reserves in the taf auction at the minimum bid 
mr clouse of course in doing so they would be suffering a 25 basis point cost in that operation so it wouldnt be an incentive  
mr plosser well they are borrowing at less than the primary credit rate right that is what they would be doing today 
mr burke i think the context for these tools is that we are in an exit strategy with rising rates the spreads are much larger than they are now when everything is compressed  the other side of that is if we want banks to use the facility and be interested our feeling was that you need to allow them either to break the trade if they needed funds or to be able to pledge it as collateral at the discount window if they needed funds 
mr plosser well but at the end of the day that kind of undoes the purpose of the term deposits to begin with  right i guess here is my point  i think this is maybe part of what president lacker may be getting ata lot of these tools interact with each other in how you would design them and how you structure them  so rather than doing them on a oneoff basis we need to think of them in the context of how we are going to manage the discount window going forward are we going to have term primary credit  are we going to go back to overnight money i think these things are interrelated  and to get a sense of how they will play out we need to think of them collectively in how they interact with one another rather than on a oneoff basis i guess that is really what i am thinking about 
chairman bernanke yes we will just have to make sure that all of the pricing works so for example there could be a prepayment penalty or something to take out the deposits governor duke 
ms duke  just a response to president plosser  i think from the standpoint that the smaller banks would be the ones that would tend to use these term deposits the most and they would be unlikely to use them if there were no way to get out of them in an emergency situation  so they just need some way to reverse it  it wouldnt necessarily be a pricing piecein other words there is a penalty to do it but as long as they know they could reverse then they would be likely to use it 
mr plosser i am just saying that is fine but then that undoes the purpose that we have for the term deposit which is to reduce reserves or hit our target 
ms duke yes i think the difference is the decisionmaking of an individual institution versus the aggregate and so you have to set up something whereby the individual institution can make that choice 
chairman bernanke im sorry  vice chairman did you have something 
vice chairman dudley yes  what was interesting as we went through the crisis was that for the foreign central banks there was clearly a very high threshold against using their own dollar reserves liquidating their treasury securities or whatever to fund their domestic banks we know that because they didnt do it and they told us that they didnt want to do it because they thought it would be very confusing to the market in terms of what they were up to  was this some sort of foreign exchange intervention  or was it a sign of distress particular to their country  we also know that there was a pretty high threshold because we actually charged them quite a bit for the foreign exchange swap lines relative to the fact that they are basically virtually a riskfree rate yet they chose that rather than to liquidate their dollar reserves  so i think you have to recognize that there is something special about the dollar reserves holdings that they have that they dont want to mess with  there was a cost for them to engage in dollar reserves sales that seemed to be fairly significant as we went through the crisis 
chairman bernanke president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  i want just to explain how i understand something and ask the question whether i understand it correctly  it is really a comment in support of moving quickly with a sense of urgency counter to what president lacker said on the reverse repo counterparties and all of the other tools  i think we need to address any uncertainty about our ability to drain as i understand it if we are going to make a decision to tighten or even signal in our statement that we are moving in the direction of tightening through the rate mechanism we need to be able to execute an operation to move the federal funds rate and that is going to require the draining of lots and lots of reserves 
if we find that it is not feasible realistically to drain reserves in a time frame that is going to allow us to execute rate policy then we are probably opting for an interest on reserves policy rate that is somewhat independent of the level of excess reserves and if we are going to opt for that then we need to begin to educate the market that our implementation of monetary policy is through interest on reserves  so that is what i am thinking  tell me what i am missing or whether i dont understand something 
mr madigan president lockhart i think our view is that the primary tool will be the interest on reserves rate but the experience to date leads us to have some doubts as to whether that will put a hard floor on the federal funds rate  so were presuming that we will in order to harden that floor need to take at least some reserves out of the system  whether or not we will have to take a whole lot out at this point isnt clear but it is possible we might have to  that is why we have been working on a number of tools 
mr lockhart in the old federal funds rate system we used to operate with essentially about 30 billion to 50 billion did we not of excess reserves in order to create the supply to meet the demand that allowed us to hit that  we are a long way from that so that suggests to me that we are going to have a hybrid system  is that it  we bring excess reserves down by 300 billion or 400 billion and operate in that territory 
mr madigan thats possible well of course precrisis obviously we didnt have interest on reserves and so we have only very limited experience as to what the parameters will need to be in terms of the excess reserves rate and draining reserves to hit a particular fed funds rate target 
mr sack as i noted in my briefing however market participants are asking a lot of these same questions about the strategy  i think right now the strategy is not well defined or well laid out  so the questions they are asking are will the reserve drains take place ahead of the increase in the interest on reserves rate or concurrent with it  even if you are relying at least partially on the interest on reserves mechanism to work how then will the appropriate level of reserves be decided  so just how big will the drain be  there is obviously a lot of room between where we are and where we were in the old regime and i think they are not sure in terms of reserves where the committee intends to end up in that range 
mr lockhart mr chairman just to beat a dead horse here many of us have been out reassuring the market that we have the tools if there is uncertainty about that i think we need to smoke that out and get as clear as we can as fast as we can  i think there is a big sense of urgency around these issues 
chairman bernanke i agree  but i feel reasonably comfortable  we think the interest on excess reserves could almost probably do the job by itself because even if there is some gap it is hard to imagine that if you raised the interest rate on reserves high enough it wouldnt bring up money market rates along with it 
the ability to drain reserves sort of a beltandsuspenders thing is a second dimension of tightening and if you look at brians sequence of exit statements the first statement of actual tightening combines an increase in the interest rate on excess reserves with a 200 billion drain or something like that  and i am actually i would say moderately encouraged by what we have been hearing  the staff has been extremely effective in getting these things up so that they can operate at large scale by the end of the year or early next year  so i think we are in pretty good shape 
now of course we are in a new world but i think we are in a pretty good shape  it would be good to give more clarity to the markets but my own sense is that what we want to do is to state policy in terms of our tools  you know the federal funds rate target is not going to be particularly informative  what we are probably going to want to do the first time that we tighten is to say that we have agreed to do this to the interest rate on excess reserves to do this to the primary credit rate and to drain x hundred billion dollars of reserves  and we can see what that does and we can finetune it i think that clearly we have the ability to tighten policy  but what is not firmly complete is a sharp correspondence between our actions and money market rates obviously we know the direction but we need to get some experience with that  then i think the market is maybe a little overfixated on the question of sequencing and so on  when we have more control of the timing and more understanding of these tools it would probably pay us in a speech or some other context to lay out more clearly both what the sequencing would be and what the regime is going to be  i mean how are we going to express tightening and so on but in terms of the fundamental ability to tighten policy nothing i am hearing makes me think that we dont have that capacity 
mr lockhart that is very helpful to me just to hear your views on it 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren just a quick comment on the unintended consequences of lists  when we came up with the primary dealer list i dont think anybody could have guessed that we would have a primary dealer credit facility  so when i think of coming up with lists of counterparties i just worry about the unintended consequences  if we select firms based on size of institution it might quickly be inferred that there is a broader reason to have the list constituted the way we have it so when i think about that it does seem that governor warshs suggestion that to the extent that we can broaden it but make it manageable for the desk to do we avoid the unintended consequence of making it look like a list that was based on size that may be misinterpreted for other purposes  i know it is much easier to deal operationally with fewer counterparties but just given the perceptions that can be created by that we might want to give some thought as to whether there are ways to broaden it so that we dont give that misperception 
then the second list is the list of countries  we spend a lot of time thinking about stigma and president yellen and i were talking about this on the elevator coming up  but to the extent that we could come up with a size criterion that made it very clear that if a market got to this size then we would entertainits kind of the opposite  it seems like having a much clearer criterion one reason all of these other central banks want to be our counterparty is that we are signaling something  if we have a swap line with mexico people are inferring a signal that we are comfortable having them as a counterparty  i worry about stigmatizing the countries like mexico and korea and other countries that want potentially to be a counterparty in part for the signaling benefit the way we get around that is if we have a very clear criterion that says if you get to this size then maybe we will think about having a swap line  maybe size isnt the right metric but coming up with some metric other than countryspecific choices would make me more comfortable with that list as well 
chairman bernanke the north american location is hard to change  laughter president yellen you had a twohander 
ms yellen yes i just wanted to support that point  we were discussing this and i agree with president rosengrens comments i do think we should think about if we stigmatize this larger group of countries what their response might be  for example they might not feel so happy about having unfettered capital flows or having subsidiaries or branches of us or europeanbased multilateral banks in their countries  they might change the way in which they supervise and regulate those operations if they thought it was not automatic that they would get access to dollar liquidity in the same way they did in this crisis 
if i could justthis is the only thing i want to comment onrespond to president plossers comment on this that ideally they have large stocks of reserves and we should want to encourage them to use those reserves first before drawing on us  i am not sure that is actually true i think that the distinction here is similar to the old one between inside and outside money  the reserves that they hold are equivalent to inside money  when they sell dollar reserves they have in a crisis situation to provide liquidity to their banks it is a propagation mechanism for causing exchange rate movements and international transmission of the disturbances that they are suffering in contrast when we provide liquidity we are printing money  we are adding to the stock of outside money and we circumvent those repercussions  so in a crisis the dynamics arent the same  there is a good reason to have this kind of facility 
mr tarullo janet i think your comment may have answered my question about your first observation so you would favor a broad range of permanent swap facilities 
ms yellen you know i dont know what the right answer is but i am worried about restricting it to these four  president bullard mentioned this concern as well and i think president rosengren is suggesting one way to use criteria to maybe broaden the group  but i am quite concerned about singling out these four and not making it larger  i understand there are political issues around that and boundary problems and so forth  but i am concerned about limiting it to these four  and there could be economic consequences  if you take a country like korea and you say well we are not putting you in the same category as before beyond what they might do with our banks they may decide they need an even larger war chest  they may be more reluctant to have current account adjustments  it could have implications for 
mr tarullo so you are kind of for swaps but are leaning toward more rather than fewer 
ms yellen right 
mr tarullo okay 
chairman bernanke the four big ones clearly have far bigger banking sectors than any other countries in the world  president bullard 
mr bullard thank you mr chairman  i just wanted to follow up and echo the points that president yellen was just making  we have talked a lot here about swaps and it has always been a very intuitive thing about what countries are included and which are not and why not i think what we need is to lay out a policy for why countries are in and why countries are out and then we would have something to say when singapore comes to us as to why we are making the decision that we are making  i understand it is wrapped up with other sorts of geopolitical considerations but there should be some sort of basic criteria that will delineate why certain countriesi can imagine asian countries being moderately upset that the swiss are in for instance when i say swiss its a small country come on  this is an old club that you guys have been fostering for years  and you just dont like us because were in asia  i can imagine that that is sort of the attitude  so if we could delineate a clearer policy about why we are doing this that would also help us a lot on the mexican situation and canada which has been inherited from the nafa treaty but you guys all know this  it is all very sensitive because of the difficulties of assessing country risk and really saying hey your economy is not up to this  so that is where i think we should go  
chairman bernanke i have twohanders from presidents plosser and lockhart 
mr plosser yes i had a quick comment  janet i think were talking about two different things  my support for the swaps early in the crisis is exactly the point you were making of the difference between inside and outside money and i understand that  i was more concerned about having these lines of swaps continuously open in normal times whether we really wanted them used or whether as vice chairman dudley suggests we price them in a way that prevents their usage except when a crisis might occur i think that was where i was going 
chairman bernanke president lockhart 
mr lockhart nathan arent these facilities to four central banks effectively providing liquidity facilities through the central bank to at least three and maybe four major eurodollar markets that would operate just as we did  they have foreign bank organizations that can get liquidity in a time of crisis  so south korea or thailand or whatever would be going to market conceivably in one of these places to get their liquidity is that right 
mr sheets yes absolutely  the memo that we put forward didnt have a lot of quantitative indicators for these economies  weve gone down that path in the past and the problem we have is that there is a whole range of different thingscomparing apples and oranges that makes it very difficult to compare  but in this particular case one of the reasons we came up with the recommendation that we did is as the chairman mentioned the large size of the financial institutions from these four and then the dollar funding markets in these economies clearly set them apart from other potential counterparties  you really see a qualitative difference between the folks that we are recommending and the ones that we arent  given that there is such a gap my sense is that its not creating stigma in saying that the dollar funding needs and the size of institutions for these four are different from those for the koreans or the mexicans  i think they very much agree with that 
now the justification for the north american ones is a little different  as the chairman mentioned that has to do with the extent of our integration  if mexico blows up there is a high probability that were going to feel some effect from that or if the canadians have some sort of financial tension theres a high probability were going to feel that  that is a different kind of relationship than exists with some of the asian economies even though we also very much value those relationships 
the other point that i think is worth making here which also helps with the stigma point is that over the last year the stable of imf facilities has expanded  in particular they now have a very attractive facility the flexible credit lines which mexico has received which is geared for toptier emergingmarket economies and is designed to give them significant access to liquidity frankly on moregenerous terms and longer horizons than our swap lines would  so there are other mechanisms out there in the global financial system to address these issues of stigma including what the imf has to offer 
chairman bernanke president lockhart in one of my  previous comments to you about our ability to tighten i should have mentioned this  the backup to all of that is the lacker strategy of course of selling the assets which we can always do if necessary  anyone else  
mr lacker potentially a primary strategy  laughter 
chairman bernanke im  just saying in terms of having some assurance that we can respond if necessary  okay  thank you for very useful input  we will try to get something to you to get more comments shortly we do need to quickly ratify domestic open market operations  could i have a motion  
mr kohn so moved 
chairman bernanke any objection  okay coffee is ready  why dont we take about fifteen minutes for coffee 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke okay why dont we recommence  next on the agenda is the economic situation  let me turn it over to dave stockton to begin the presentation 
mr stockton thank you mr chairman  with the incoming data having been unusually kind to us and changes in conditioning assumptions having only small and largely offsetting effects the broad contours of the greenbook forecast have changed very little since september  as we had anticipated real gdp turned up last quarter and appears to be on track to expand again in the current quarter  on average we project real activity to increase at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second half of this year roughly speaking we expect the economy to expand at a similar pace through most of 2010 before picking up more noticeably in 2011  the main drivers behind our forecast of continued moderate growth are an accommodative monetary policy an easing of tight credit conditions a gradual waning of negative wealth effects and an accompanying improvement in household and business sentiment 
while these same factors have been a feature of our forecast since last spring we 
now have some tangible evidence of their influence on financial and economic 
conditions the stock market has moved well above its earlier lows house prices 
appear to have flattened out bond spreads have come in dramatically and household 
and business confidence has rebounded these improvements have been 
accompanied by upturns in real gdp industrial production and importantly final sales in the household sector consumer spending has been increasing at a moderate pace even after accounting for the fluctuations induced by the cashforclunkers program and home sales and housing starts have been trending up  and in the business sector equipment spending appears to be stabilizing after declining steeply for a year and a half 
of course while the overall improvements that have occurred in financial conditions spending and production are supportive of our outlook these developments far from ensure the continued steady gains in output that we are projecting indeed if you view current conditions as inconsistent with the tenor of the recovery that we are projecting we would agree  our forecast is predicated upon a further narrowing of the equity premium an additional decline in bond spreads some easing of currently tight credit conditions and further improvements in household and business sentiment 
while in broad terms events have been unfolding much as we had expected there have been some surprises with which we have had to contend  once again the incoming data on spending and production have been somewhat stronger than we expected whereas the data on employment and hours have been weaker  as a result we now estimate that labor productivity increased at an average annual rate of about 5 percent through the first three quarters of this year  with both our statistical filtering models and the anecdotal reports suggesting that some of these increases will be permanent we raised our estimate of the level of structural productivity in this forecast 
given this higher level of structural productivity we now think businesses will have less need to increase labor input in order to meet rising product demand  as a consequence we postponed the projected bottomingout of employment until early next year with noticeable job gains not expected to be evident until the spring  accordingly the unemployment rate is now projected to peak above 10 percent in coming months and to recede to 9 percent by the end of next year and to 8 percent in late 2011a path that is about  percentage point above that incorporated in our september greenbook 
beyond dealing with the crosscurrents in the incoming data we confronted only small and largely offsetting changes in the major factors conditioning our forecast  a slightly weaker dollar somewhat faster growth in foreign activity and a gradual spur to demand from the higher level of potential output were pluses for projected growth of real gdp but these favorable influences were more than offset by a weaker stock market and higher oil prices  on net we edged down projected growth of real gdp a tenth in both 2010 and 2011to increases of 34 percent and 44 percent respectively 
because the basic contour of the forecast and its rationale are so similar to our previous projection i thought i would organize the remainder of my remarks around four questions that could be raised about our projection especially in light of recent developments  first are we giving too little signal to the recent strength in the readings on spending and production  second are we giving too much signal to the recent weakness in the data from the labor market  third and in the opposite direction are we headed for an extended jobless recovery  and fourth with fiscal impetus likely to fade and the inventory cycle providing only a transitory lift to production why are we forecasting a sustained acceleration of activity 
let me start by addressing the question of whether we are reading too little signal into the unexpected strength in the recent data on spending and production  as you know we revised up again our estimate of the growth of real gdp in the third quarterin this forecast about 1 percentage point to 3 percent at an annual rate  but rather than propagating forward any of that impulse to growth as might be suggested by some models of real gdp we have actually revised down the growth of real gdp in the current quarter about  percentage point to an annual rate of 2 percent  we think that there are a few reasons to believe that the thirdquarter gdp figures overstate the underlying pace of the expansion 
for one we are skeptical of the beas outsized estimate of the positive contribution of motor vehicle inventories to thirdquarter gdp  in my experience most folks would rather have bamboo shoots placed under their fingernails than have to sit through an explanation of light truck inventory valuations  laughter so perhaps this will be a painful introduction for president kocherlakota to some of the more arcane aspects of the forecast while models of truck inventories are found infrequently in the american economic review these types of models are a mainstay where most of my important results appear the journal of obscure and largely useless facts laughter we do a fairly detailed accounting of motor vehicle inventories by make and model and we dont see in the data the massive shift in the composition of inventories toward highervalued vehicles that is implied by the beas figures to be sure we miss from time to time but rarely by the  percentage point of real gdp implied by the published data  in the forecast we assume that a more normal composition of motor vehicle inventories will be established in the fourth quarter with a corresponding deduction from the contribution to real gdp growth 
a second reason to discount the strength in thirdquarter gdp is that some of the gain reflected a surge in defense spending  because outlays are constrained by the level of appropriations some of last quarters spending probably came at the expense of spending this quarter 
finally we have also discounted some of the recent strength in consumer spending here however ill admit that we are on more uncertain terrain  real pce excluding motor vehicles increased at annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter about  percentage point faster than we had projected pushing the saving rate down to 3 percent with income so weak consumer credit conditions tight and confidence still at a low level we have responded to the unexpected strength by marking down our estimates of the change in real pce for the next few months 
the bottom line is that we do read the incoming data as suggesting that the economy is stronger in the second half of this year than we had previously thought but not by as much as the upward revision to the thirdquarter increase in real gdp might suggest 
the second question i posed is whether we are taking too much signal from the recent weakness in the labor data  after all the decline of 210000 in private payrolls in september was only about 100000 jobs weaker than our expectation and the rise in the unemployment rate to 98 percent was in line with our forecast  yet we weakened employment appreciably in coming months and raised projected unemployment 
as i mentioned earlier in light of continuing upside surprises in labor productivity we felt a balanced reading of the data would include ascribing some of this strength to permanent increases in the level of structural productivity  many of you have reported stories from your contacts suggesting that under enormous pressure firms are finding ways to innovate to cut costs  moreover the recession has probably led lessefficient capacity to be taken offline with positive consequences for average labor productivity in the short run given our forecast for aggregate demand these changes result in a weaker projected labor market 
indeed some of you may be concerned that we didnt move far enough in this direction and might wonder why we arent forecasting a more protracted period of jobless recovery  in our forecast we raised our estimates of the increase in structural productivity for last year and this year but have just carried that higher level through to 2010 and 2011 implicitly we are assuming that businesses have already achieved most of the outsized efficiency gains available to them  but it is certainly possible that they could have a lot further to go on this front 
we illustrated a productivitydriven jobless recovery in an alternative simulation in the greenbook according to that simulation if increases in actual labor productivity were to average about 3 percent per annum over the next few years rather than the 1 percent pace we are projecting the unemployment rate would still be above 9 percent at the end of 2011  we acknowledge that this is a distinct risk but we see this possibility as balancing the risk that by raising structural productivity in the baseline forecast we may have overreacted to what will ultimately prove to have been a cyclical pop in output per hour in those circumstances once the uncertainty about the durability of the recovery recedes firms could well move more aggressively to increase hiring  i should note that in defense of the baseline forecast against these two alternatives our employment projection is consistent with initial claims continuing to drift down at about the same pace that they have in recent months 
the fourth question i posed was why do we think that there will be a gradual acceleration of activity especially in 2011 even as the stimulus from fiscal policy fades and the boost from the turn in the inventory cycle plays out one reason is that in contrast to some outside forecasters we see the contribution to growth from inventory investment at least outside motor vehicles as likely to be a fairly steady positive through 2011 adding about  percentage point to the growth of real gdp next year and about  percentage point to growth in 2011  these inventories have been liquidated at an increasing pace in recent quarters and thus their eventual contribution to the growth of real gdp still lies ahead  we are forecasting the inventory cycle to be stretched out because we anticipate that business caution and constrained credit availability will fade only slowly 
as you know from reading the greenbook fiscal policy is expected to provide an impetus to real gdp growth of about 1 percentage point both this year and next and then to be a neutral influence on growth in 2011  but this fading impetus is offset by an accommodative monetary policy and generally improving financial conditions which are stimulating demands that are further amplified by positive multiplier accelerator forces by 2011 these influences should be making their clearest mark on spending for durable goods housing and business investment all of which are the components of demand most sensitive to the cost and availability of credit and capital even so our projected rebound in these categories of spending still leaves investment shares low by historical standards  for these reasons we continue to see the baseline forecast as the best bet in an admittedly wide range of possible outcomes  
the major news of note on the inflation side of our forecast has been the further upward shift in the path for crude oil prices  the corresponding upward revision that we have made to consumer energy prices has led us to mark up our projection for total pce inflation by nearly  percentage point in the current quarter and in the first quarter of next year to 2 percent and 1 percent respectively  beyond that our forecast is virtually identical to the one in september as the indirect effects of higher energy prices are offset by the wider margin of slack in this forecast 
core pce prices which increased at an annual rate of 15 percent in the third quarter are projected to gradually slow to a 11 percent pace in 2010 and a 1 percent pace in 2011  given the considerable slack that we expect to prevail in product and labor markets over the next two years this disinflation is relatively muted owing to our view that longerrun inflation expectations will remain reasonably stable  for headline inflation the current and expected rise in energy prices results in an acceleration of total pce prices from a 11 percent increase this year to an increase of 14 percent in 2010 with a much shallower rise in energy prices projected for 2011 headline inflation falls back to a 1 percent pace the same as that of core prices  steve will continue our presentation  
mr kamin since your last meeting there hasnt been enough time to complete the playoffs and the world series much less to significantly alter our outlook for the world economy  we feel more secure that a global recovery is under way and weve notched our forecast of overall foreign gdp growth a bit higher for the near term thereafter however our outlook is little changed and we continue to grapple with some pretty thorny questions about how the recovery abroad will play out 
as nathan has reported to you in past meetings the bounceback from recession has been strongest in those regions that were least implicated in the initial financial turmoil  we had already judged that economic growth in emerging asiawhich soared at a 14 percent annual rate in the second quarterrisked being too hot not to cool assuaging our concerns somewhat incoming data suggest that emerging asian gdp decelerated in the third quarter but to a stillstrong 9 percent we have already received gdp numbers for china at 98 percent singapore at nearly 15 percent and korea at 123 percent 
in latin america as well a strong recovery appears to be in progress  the brazilian economy had already grown nearly 8 percent in the second quarter and indications are that a solid expansion has continued on the back of government credit programs expansionary fiscal policies higher commodity prices and improvements in financial markets  in mexico where gdp had plunged again in the second quarter as a result of swine flu and autoindustry cutbacks recent increases in industrial production and exportsmuch of them tied to the reviving us marketpoint to a sharp rise in activity in the third quarter  all told we now estimate that latin american gdp after falling 2 percent in the second quarter rebounded nearly 7 percent in the third 
going forward we anticipate that overall growth in emerging economies will step down to a more sustainable 5 percent pace over the next two years  such solid but unspectacular expansion is by no means assured  the ongoing rebound may be more dependent than weve assumed on extraordinary fiscal and credit stimulus in china which has generated important spillovers via higher imports and commodity prices but this stimulus cannot last forever  additionally the current surge in production in china and elsewhere may in part involve inventory restocking predicated on overly optimistic anticipations of export sales to the advanced economies  but even so the fundamental underpinnings of recovery in emerging markets seem fairly strong  their financial systems are in reasonably good shape they are regaining access to international credit markets and in most cases they have scope for further stimulus of domestic demand if conditions warrant 
we are frankly less confident about the prospects for the advanced foreign economies  data for the third quarter have been mixed  in japan recent readings on industrial production consumption and trade have been quite positive and suggest another solid rise in gdp and in the euro area further increases in purchasing manager surveys industrial production and new orders suggest expansion  however gdp in the united kingdom surprised us by dropping 1 percent in the third quarter despite survey indicators pointing to moderate growth  and canadas monthly gdp series moved down in both july and as we learned after the greenbook projection was put to bed august as well all told we estimate that gdp in the advanced foreign economies grew 1 percent in the third quarter its first positive reading since the first quarter of 2008 but a touch below what wed written down in september 
although we expect the recovery in the advanced foreign economies to quicken in the current quarter we continue to struggle with the longerterm outlook  on the one hand financial stresses and balance sheet problems point to an unusually slow and prolonged recovery in both the united kingdom and the euro area bank loans have been declining in recent months while these declines may reflect weak demand for loans as well as weak supply the stresses in the banking sector are worrisome particularly given the bankcentric nature of intermediation in europe  on the other hand deep recessions historically have given way to sharp recoveries  moreover future economic growth should receive important boosts from the inventory cycle the expansion of exports to the united states and emerging markets and continued policy stimulus 
balancing these forces for recovery with the headwinds from the financial sector i described earlier we continue to project economic growth through the forecast period of some 2 to 3 percent a pace that only slowly erodes the extent of resource slack  partly as a result headline consumer price inflation which currently is running negative on a 12month basis in most foreign advanced economies picks up only gradually over the next few years accordingly we continue to believe that major foreign central banks will wait until the second half of next year or early 2011 to start tightening policy anticipations of this extended period of low rates and ample liquidity appear to explain why longterm government bond yields throughout the advanced economies have remained low since this summer even as the accelerating global economic recovery has supported increases in equity prices declines in credit spreads and upticks in a wide range of commodity prices  notably wti oil prices have risen some 8 per barrel over the intermeeting period apparently reflecting optimism about future demand 
unlike the price of oil the value of the dollar ended up little changed over the intermeeting period but it garnered an awful lot of attention on the way  a number of points are worth noting here first although the broad dollar index has fallen 11 percent since its recent peak last march it had risen about 20 percent since the summer of 2008 and so remains above that previous low  second we continue to believe that much of the prior upswing in the dollar was due to flighttosafety flows and dollar shortages in funding markets and that as brian sack suggested earlier this afternoon the fall in the dollar since the spring has principally reflected the reversal of those developments as financial stresses have abated  the contained nature of us treasury yields might seem to contradict this narrative of rising appetite for risk but as i noted earlier foreign bond yields have also remained quiescent likely anticipating a long period of monetary accommodation  furthermore we have seen little evidence that foreigners particularly in the official sector are shifting out of dollars to a significant extent or that any other sort of disorderly conditions are materializing 
finally the decline in the dollar to date will lend important support to us economic activity  at present we anticipate that us net exports having added some  2 percentage points to us gdp growth during the first half of this year will have a roughly neutral influence thereafter as the stimulus from a sharp recovery in exports is about offset by a similar expansion of imports  an alternative simulation included in the international developments section of the greenbook which shows the effects of a 10 percent decline in the real broad index of the dollar provides some sense of the implications for the outlook had the dollar remained at its march peak  export growth would be some 2 to 3 percentage points lower import growth about the same  amount higher and us gdp growth as much as 1 percentage point lower by the second half of next year as well inflation would be about  percentage point lower  accordingly the depreciation weve seen to date has helped to reflate the economy while avoiding becoming disorderly  going forward we project much more gradual dollar depreciation as is our wont but we will be monitoring exchange markets carefully for any moreabrupt shifts  brian madigan will now continue our presentation 
mr madigan2 footnote 2 the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2 end footnote 2   i will be referring to the package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections  exhibit 1 depicts the broad contours of your projections for 2009 to 2012 and over the longer run  most of you continue to project a protracted economic recovery with the unemployment rate declining slowly and inflation remaining subdued over the next few years  based on your accompanying narratives most of you anticipate that about five to six years will be needed for the economy to converge fully to its longerrun path  however some  of you stated that the convergence process might well require seven or eight years while a few of you expect inflation to reach its longerrun rate in just a few years but anticipate that the convergence process for the real economy could take somewhat longer 
exhibit 2 reports summary statistics regarding your projections for 2009  your previous projectionscollected in conjunction with the june fomc meetingare provided in italics and greenbook forecasts are included as a memo item your current projections for real gdp growth this year have a central tendency of about minus  percent to zero around a percentage point higher than in june  the gdp decline during the first half was a bit sharper than most of you expected at the time of the june meeting which took place a few weeks before the beas publication of its preliminary second quarter release and its substantial downward revision for first quarter regarding the second half most of you now anticipate 3 to 3 percent real gdp growth a couple of percentage points higher than the central tendency of your projections last june some of you noted that the recent pickup in economic activity was importantly influenced by transitory government programs such as cashforclunkers and the firsttimehomebuyer tax credit 
your projections for the fourthquarter average unemployment rate are about the same as those made in june and your forecasts for inflation for the year as a whole are also little changed however for the first half of 2009 overall and core inflation came in somewhat lower than most of you had anticipated  for the second half most of you revised up your forecasts for overall inflation probably reflecting at least in part the recent increase in energy prices and many of you shaded up your forecasts for core inflation 
exhibit 3 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run  the broad contours of these projections are much the same as in june  most of you anticipate that real gdp will increase 2 to 3 percent in 2010 and then accelerate by about a percentage point to about 3 to 4 percent in 2011 with growth remaining brisk in 2012  a few of you made modest revisions to your estimates regarding the longerrun sustainable rate of gdp growth but the central tendency of longerrun growth projections is virtually unchanged at 2 to 2 percent 
most of your unemployment rate projections for 2010 and 2011 moved down a notch since june perhaps reflecting stronger nearterm growth but nearly all of you still expect the unemployment rate to remain above 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 moreover nearly half of you made upward revisions to your projections regarding the rate of unemployment that is sustainable over the longer run the central tendency for these projections now stands at 5 to 5 percent roughly  percentage point higher than in june 
as in june most of you see the outlook for inflation as subdued over the next several years your projections for total pce inflation next year have a central tendency of about 1 to 1 percent a bit above the central tendency of your core inflation forecasts perhaps reflecting lingering effects of increased energy prices  most of you see total and core inflation next year running noticeably below the 1 to 2 percent central tendency of your longerrun inflation projections shown to the right for total inflation over 2011 and 2012 your inflation projections exhibit considerable dispersion with a central tendency of roughly 1 to 2 percent and by 2012 a range of about  to 2 percent this dispersion apparently reflects substantial differences in your views of the determinants of inflation and to a degree differences in your estimates of economic slack  perhaps the staff briefing on inflation dynamics at the december meeting and the subsequent committee discussion will further elucidate the reasons for these divergences 
the left panels of exhibit 4 indicate that nearly all of you continue to view the degree of uncertainty surrounding your projections of both output growth and inflation as high compared with historical norms  in your narratives some of you cite continuing vulnerabilities in the financial sector as reasons for this elevated uncertainty while others highlight the uncertainties associated with fiscal stimulus and persistent budget deficits as shown in the righthand panels nearly all of you now judge that the risks to output growth are roughly balanced with a sharp drop since june in the number who see the risks tilted to the downside  most of you also 
continue to view the risks to the inflation outlook the lower righthand panel as 
roughly balanced however a few of you see the prospect of protracted economic 
slack as tilting the inflation risks to the downside while a few others point to the 
challenges in managing the federal reserves balance sheet and possible adverse 
effects of fiscal policy on inflation expectations as skewing those risks to the upside  
that concludes our presentation mr chairman   

chairman bernanke thank you very much  questions for our colleagues  it must be a very good briefing   
mr stockton as we used to say in little league mr chairman a walk is as good as a hit laughter 
chairman bernanke im detecting a theme here  okay  then were ready to begin our goround president lockhart youre leadoff hitter  
mr lockhart leadoff hitter laughter  singles and doubles mr chairman  despite betterthanexpected economic growth in the third quarter the sentiment of my sixth district directors and business contacts has neither improved nor deteriorated substantially since our last meeting the current tenor of business activity is flat to moderately more positive but where it is more positive there is uneasiness that improvement may not be sustainable 
several directors reported conversations citing uncertainty about the future policy environment including health care policy as retarding hiring and investment  we also heard skepticism about the durability of private spending absent stimulus programs  a number of my contacts said that orders and topline revenue would have to grow a great deal and be sustained for many months before new fulltime hiring or capital expenditures would be undertaken  firms reported that they have ample ability to expand their business with their existing labor force and temporary labor if needed  however few expect a significant upturn in orders in the near term  our inquiries about capital expansion got more than a few incredulous looks  capital spending for business expansion does not seem to be a realistic consideration for most of our contacts 
i continue to hear that small businesses are struggling to find adequate financing to support any expansion and rehiring  work done recently by the atlanta research staff on the makeup of job losses points to the unusually large concentration of job losses in the small business sector  through the end of 2008 businesses with 50 or fewer employees accounted for about 45 percent of net job losses in the recession  firms of this size accounted for only about 9 percent of job losses in the 2001 recession  our contacts also broadly confirm the view that a major commercial real estate problem is developing  we have the view along with others that commercial real estate will have a sizable downside impact on regional and small banks  i am concerned that the interplay of the commercial real estate correction and weak job growth due to constrained credit is shaping up to be a serious headwind 
to sum up anecdotal feedback from our recent contact cycle does not validate any reliable trend in the stronger gdp numbers and paints a picture of highly cautious and extremely reluctant business actors  that said i think it is reasonable to incorporate solid nearterm growth in secondhalf estimates but i remain skeptical about the medium term  i remain to the pessimistic side of the greenbook forecast and i am not inclined to make too much of improved recent and nearterm expected data in thinking about exit timing and communication 
as regards the inflation outlook incoming price data suggest a little more disinflationary pressure than i had assumed in june  in the forecast submitted with this meeting i marked down my core inflation projection a little and i judge the inflationdeflation risks to be roughly balanced 
in preparation for this meeting i and my staff had a number of conversations with financial market participants  there was uniform satisfaction with the continuing normalization of financial markets  contacts expressed more confidence and reported that they believed the markets in general have confidence in the idea that the fed has the tools to execute an exit strategy  a universal concern however is the strategic approach to and timing of the exit  my contacts see some risk of a premature exit a concern i share but what was most notable in my recent conversations was concern about premature communication of exit intentions and the market reaction to changes in the committees statement wording  i wont venture any further into tomorrows discussion  so i will stop there  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser thank you mr chairman  i guess im up second  so i dont know what that means im supposed to do as a baseball player  get on base right 
mr tarullo advance the runner 
mr plosser advance the ball  laughter 
participant  sacrifice 
chairman bernanke hit to the right side  laughter 
mr plosser hit to the right side behind the runner right  that should be easy  laughter thank you mr chairman  business conditions in the third district remained sluggish in september and october  while regional business contacts continue to anticipate a recovery in the months ahead expectations of the recoverys strength seem to have moderated somewhat and uncertainty abounds  so let me touch on a few highlights 
our manufacturing surveys general business activity index fell from 141 to 115 in october however i am not too concerned about this slight drop  the index has been positive now for three consecutive months  the last time that occurred was in november 2007  the index of future activity remains high although it was down a few points from september  it is well within recovery ranges from past experience  payroll employment continues to decline in the region and at a slightly faster pace than reported six weeks ago but the rate of decline still is less negative than that of the nation as a whole  the average unemployment rate in the three states in the district rose 02 percentage point to 92 percent but still remains below the national figure  the districts commercial real estate market continues to be weak as it seems to be everywhere  our contacts tell us that they are not expecting any improvement there until 2011 
at the national level recent data on the economy continue to point to an emergent recovery  financial market conditions continue to improve but the labor market remains under severe stress and i anticipate further modest increases in the unemployment rate  nevertheless the pace and character of real activity appears to be consistent with employment growth turning positive in the nottoodistant future  i have become more confident rather than less that the emerging recovery will be a sustainable one even after the effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus begin to wane 
on balance the recent data on thirdquarter growth came in somewhat stronger than i expected in our last forecast submission  this has led me to revise up slightly my own projection for growth in 2009 compared with that in june  but the basic structure and shape of my forecast for 2010 and beyond remains largely unchanged from my june forecast  i anticipate that the recovery will gain more solid footing as we move into 2010 and real growth will average about 3 percent in 2010 through 2012 this is somewhat weaker growth in output than in the greenbook  i suspect the differences between our forecasts reflect different assumptions about the magnitude of the impact of the fiscal stimulus and the evolution of natural or potential output  indeed if there is a risk to my gdp forecast it is likely to be to the upsidethat is economic growth could easily turn out to be faster than the 3 percent average that i am predicting 
my forecast for inflation continues to differ from the greenbooks  in the near term i expect inflation to remain rather benign but i expect it to drift up over the next couple of years  in contrast the greenbook anticipates disinflationary pressures over the forecast period based on low levels of resource utilization and large output gaps  i believe that we will ultimately maintain a moderate rate of inflation but to do so will require a significantly higher path for the fed funds rate than is in the greenbook 
my view of optimal policy therefore assumes that the fed funds rate will reach 2 percent by the end of 2010 still very low by historical standards  associated with an increase in the funds rate i assume that we will begin reducing the level of excess reserves in the banking system through our various tools that weve been discussing 
my inflation forecast is shaped by my views about the fundamental drivers of inflation dynamics  i concur with the broad thrust of president bullards memorandum on output gaps  i have been arguing for some time now that i am skeptical that low resource utilization and large negative gaps as typically measured are generically useful concepts for thinking about the structural determinants of inflation dynamics  aside from the difficulties of measurement surrounding gaps the current stateoftheart empirical models of inflation dynamics such as the new keynesian dsge models do not give clear guidance on the appropriate role of traditional output and employment gaps  that is not to say that we cannot build models where such gaps might matter  we clearly can  but it means that the nature of our debate is about the models and just as important about the nature of the shocks we are facing 
we should remember that these newer models were developed in part as an outgrowth of the failure of earlier models to capture the instability in the inflationoutput dynamics  like president bullards my reading of the empirical evidencefor example stock and watsons recent work on phillips curve forecastsis that gap or activity measures are not reliable predictors of inflation for the post1970s us economy  indeed recent work by the philadelphia staff looked at phillips curve forecasts of inflation over the last six recessions  outside the doubledip recession of 1980 and 1981 gapaugmented inflation prediction equations would not have led to significantly better forecasts than benchmark autoregressive models  notably this was also true in the 197475 recession in which a fairly large unemployment gap opened up and it is also true for the current recession 
i am more persuaded by the theoretical and empirical evidence that indicates that inflation outcomes depend importantly on inflation expectations which in turn depend significantly on our own credibility and commitment to price stability  philadelphia has its own new keynesian dsge forecasting model in which inflation dynamics are governed primarily by expected inflation and marginal costs as these models tend to imply and it suggests much greater inflationary pressures than in the greenbook especially when one conditions on the greenbook funds rate path  in that conditional forecast inflation runs at about 5 percent by 2012  the unconditional forecast from the model calls for a funds rate path that looks more like that embodied in the current futures market but even in that forecast inflation rates drift up noticeably over the forecast period  admittedly different specifications of such models will likely lead to different inflation forecasts but a key element of all these equilibrium models is the interplay between monetary policy actions expectations and economic outcomes  they suggest that if we respond in an appropriate and predictable manner to the shocks in the economy inflation expectations will remain anchored and inflation will remain stable 
fortunately measures of mediumterm and longerterm expectations of inflation have largely remained stable  however inflation uncertainty seems to be rising  the philadelphia staff examined the crosssectional dispersion of inflation forecasts from our spf respondents since the 1980s  to the extent that the forecast dispersion is lower when monetary policy is more credible we can take comfort in the fact that the forecast dispersion today is quite a bit lower than it was during the 1980s  however dispersion measures such as the standard deviation or interquartile range have been trending up since 2005 and have risen noticeably since 2007  this trend i think bears watching as it may be an early signal that the stability of inflation expectations may become fragile 
the concern that ive been expressing for the last several meetings is that we are creating a narrative that overemphasizes resource utilization as a determinant of monetary policy  a key question we will face in the months ahead is when to begin the policytightening cycle  the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions taken to date raise the possibility that policy may have to be recalibrated at a time when potentially mismeasured gaps suggest that a combination of actions should remain in place  the message we continue to drive home in our statement that stresses gaps and slack make this transition or recalibration more difficult andor more disruptive than necessary or it may even lead us to inappropriately delay action 
more generally i believe that the timing of our recalibration will mean that we will need to pay attention to more than just gaps and measures of expected inflation  given the extraordinary nature of our actions and the consequences for our balance sheet and the fact that we are de facto with a zero lower bound we will need to focus on various quantities such as the mix of required reserves to excess reserves new loan creation and general portfolio positions of banks as they seek higher returns for the massive reserves that we have forced them to absorb  as banks begin to seek higher returns excess reserves will be transformed into required reserves as the traditional moneymultiplier mechanism begins to recover  we may not be exactly sure where these funds are going  they may be used to purchase shortterm treasuries guaranteed government debt such as mbs or some other durationlengthening asset or they may go into loans as risk appetites grow  as a consequence we may find it hard to identify the early stages of such transition by monitoring only prices but it will be occurring nonetheless  thus i believe that quantity measures should become an important and routine part of our policy discussions going forward and as we contemplate the timing of our exit strategy thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president bullard 
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the eighth district economy has generally performed better than the us economy as a whole during the last two years  payroll employment nationally has declined about 54 percent since 2007 since the recession began  in the district for 16 metropolitan statistical areas payroll employment has declined only about 37 percentbad to be sure but considerably better than the nation as a whole  this generally extends across twodigit sic codes  one exception is education and health which has actually grown 37 percent nationally during the same time period but has grown only 28 percent in the district metropolitan statistical areas very recent data on employment in the district however have been worse than in the nation as a whole and were watching this very closely  but the district data tend to be more volatile as you might expect and it is not clear at this point how meaningful they are but i will report on that in the future eighth district unemployment is just over 9 percent in our sixteen msas  anecdotal reports indicateas many of you have noted and im sure will notethat commercial real estate is a key concern  the nearterm outlook for this area is quite grim indeed  businesses are very reluctant to hire and we are in an environment of continued business caution and continued caution on capital expenditures in particular 
nationally i thought it was heartening to see the positive gdp growth number after four consecutive declines i have actually seen only two positive numbers since joining the committee  laughter  i have seen four negative ones  so i hope that this is one in a long string here  i was also heartened i take this as hard evidence that the recession is ending and that we are in a position to recover from this very deep and very severe recession  we certainly had an equity market rally through the spring and summer but that was based on an expectation of actually better performance in the fall of 2009 and i think also the marking down of the probability of a very severe depressionlike outcome during the spring  that was an expectation of good numbers coming in  so it was heartening to see a good number actually come in  i expect that the economy will continue to grow in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2010 and that the probability of returning to recession at this point is small  i think history shows that the doubledip recession is actually not that common an outcome  it could happen but it is not that common 
based on both business contacts and models i expect that labor market outcomes will continue to lag behind the rest of the economy and i continue to be encouraged by growth globally on the whole  i was one who was very worried about the global nature of this downturn  i thought we might get stuck in a new reality that we did not understand completely and that we had not faced in the postwar era  that has turned out to be unwarranted  we have a lot of growth globally and i find that very encouraging  
i continue to believe that there is a nearterm deflation risk and a mediumterm risk of higherthandesired inflation and that is how i have continued to describe the inflation outlook  i do think the nearterm deflation risk is fading  i am not quite ready to give it up completely maybe if we make it all the way into 2010  for instance yearoveryear cpi headline inflation is actually still negative so i am still a little worried that if we got some bad data over the winter you could get into a deflationary scenario  but the risk of that is fading  the medium termsay twotothreeyearinflation risk is rising because of large fiscal deficits and a very accommodative monetary policy which may in fact overwhelm all other considerations 
inflation expectations are relatively stable indeed but in my opinion it is a bit of an illusion i think expectations are more at risk of becoming unmoored today than at any time in the 25 years prior to this crisis  if we were a smaller emergingmarket type of economy pursuing the policies we are pursuing today we would not do very well  investment would flee our country and our currency would depreciate a lot  we do not see those outcomes in the united states partly because were the big kid on the block  we have a lot of size and we have a reservoir of credibility on our side  but those advantages do not guarantee success and should not lull us into complacency about the types of outcomes that can materialize when you put these types of policies in place 
the greenbook policy path for the fed funds rate seems unlikely to me  i think we may be forced into a tightening action well before 2012 even though the 2012 date is actually consistent with the past behavior of this committee  in the past the committee has not started a tightening cycle until two and a half to three years after the recession was over that was the case in 1994 and again in 2004  our quantitative easing program as envisioned in the greenbook looks suboptimal to me  it is unclear to me why we should take a large position in agency mbs arguing that it influences longterm interest rates and then not adjust on that margin in reaction to incoming data on the economy  this is a tool that we can and should use to carry out stabilization policy for the united states during the period when our preferred shortterm interest rate instrument is near zero  the greenbook does not do this so far as the key assumption is buy and hold for agency mbs with no change in purchases beyond those currently scheduled  that sounds to me like a suboptimal policy  it should be a statecontingent policy and i would like to see more along these lines  but i will reserve the rest of my comments on policy for tomorrow  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  incoming data seem consistent with thirdquarter and fourthquarter gdp growth averaging roughly 3 percenta welcome change after several consecutive quarters of decline  however although i expect the economy to continue to recover it will likely grow much more slowly than previous recoveries i remain particularly concerned that as the monetary and fiscal supports subside there will be insufficient private spending to make much progress in labor markets  growth in consumption and housing tend to be drivers in recoveries and although both grew in the third quarter they were supported by a variety of government programs which are now in the process of winding down  as a result i expect that by the end of next year unemployment will not be much lower than its current level an outcome quite similar to the greenbook forecast  i expect that even by the end of 2012 the unemployment rate will be well above our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment   
 the greenbook assumes that credit conditions will ease making credit more available for businesses and households  i am concerned that banking conditions over the next year may well deteriorate  for many banks nonperforming loans are rising and rising faster than they are reserving for problem loans  thus i expect that capital constraints will not ease over the next year  in fact they might tighten 
research at the boston fed has found that forecasters tend to underpredict unemployment when the percent of bank assets in banks with a poor camels rating is elevated  currently the percent of bank assets in banks with a camels rating of 3 or worse is high and climbing  supporting this concern is the decline in lending in the call report data which are continuing to worsen in fact if one splits the lending between banks with a camels rating of 1 or 2 with those of 3 or worse the declines in lending are much larger at institutions experiencing problems in part because they are likely shrinking to improve their capital ratios 
in light of the substantial excess capacity in the economy and given that credit is likely to remain constrained i expect a gradual disinflation over the forecast period  the greenbook forecast for core cpi and core pce looks like an annual step function bounded below by 1 percent  my concern is that the inflation rate may not be bounded by 1 percent and we may experience more disinflation than in the greenbook forecast  in part this is the result of forecast equations in boston but in part it reflects the incoming data on wages salaries and benefits  the continued decline in the rate of growth of wages and salaries especially in the context of rapid productivity growth makes it quite unlikely that core inflation will reach my 2 percent target over the forecast period  as others noted at the last meeting this outlook represents continued poor outcomes for both aspects of our dual mandate  i hope but do not expect that growth will be faster than most of us forecast  this would at least diminish the length of the other extended period the period for which unemployment remains severely elevated 
in turn while we can hope that anchored inflation expectations will keep inflation from falling more than the greenbook envisions even in a protracted period of significant excess capacity i am concerned about the risks that expectations will move down or that they will not sufficiently offset the downward pressure from resource slack  while potential output may have fallen and the natural rate may have risen as a consequence of the crisis from which we are emerging it is difficult to imagine a shift so dramatic as to materially change the size of these resource gaps  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president fisher 
mr fisher mr chairman at our last meeting i portrayed our economic outlook from the dallas perspective for the nation  it resembled a checkmark as you may remember with a snapback in the third and fourth quarters in the 3plus percent range before settling into a lowershaped grade on the elongated side of the checkmark  and you asked i presume at the time only partially tongue in cheek whether i was talking about that or a square root sign  so i have given that a great deal of thought in the interim  laughter and i have explored with my colleagues and our business contacts the dynamics surrounding 2010 and that is what i want to talk about this afternoon 
now the nearterm outlook seems to have improved measurably because of the stabilization of inventory investment and a levelingout of consumer demand the effects of the fiscal initiative like cashforclunkers and the tax initiatives surrounding housing and the strengthening of demand for us exports  certainly the securities markets are healthier  the cost of money for those who have access to the securities marketslarge businesses not small businesseshas declined levels have declined to very palatable levels 
despite these shortterm improvements we are in my view very far from being out of the woods i am going to reflect some of the comments that have been made by others starting with president lockhart  wage and salary increases have fallen sharply  household finances are still under severe strain  the deteriorating performance of consumer and cre loans are still exerting new pressures on the financial system  and the plethora of new economic and regulatory initiatives is creating uncertainty among business decision makers as referred to by president lockhartuncertainty that appears to be retarding commitments to expansions of the workforce and to a commitment to capex in the united states  i think that the greenbook baseline forecast underestimates the continuing drag on the economy from damage to the financial sector deterioration and weakness in household cashflows and uncertainty created by the new government initiatives  it also assumes in my view a toorapid response of the unemployment rate through a reduction in the output gap when these reductions finally do begin to take hold my survey of ceos confirms some of this drag 
i do think it is important to footnote our research and that of the st louis fed in publications from a couple of years ago that look at the last nine recessions and recoveries since 1954 they show that there is a strong correlation between the lengthy expansion before the recession and the degree of what we in dallas call jobfulness of the ensuing recovery  that is there is a lot of talk about a jobless recovery  that is really not the issue  the issue is how many jobs are generated by an ensuing recovery inefficiencies in the use of labor and other factors accumulate with time  the longer the time since the last recession the greater the wave of reorganizations that follow reorganizations lead to a shedding of jobs within firms for an extended period of time during the correction or the recovery and thus they create and contribute to the degree of jobfulness of that recovery 
this is confirmed by the behavioral patterns that i am hearing from my corporate contacts these contacts continue to be pessimistic about the prospects for topline growth for 2010 though they generally feel that revenues have bottomed out  they still plan to operate in a costcontainment mode  they report littleactually noenthusiasm for expanding payrolls and capex this is very evident if you look at the large what i call logistics companiesfluor bechtel kellogg brown  root and othersare actually beginning to let people go  fluors ceo said that domestic capex is deada pretty harsh statement  the most negative in terms of capex was att it reports that it cut capex 15 percent in 2009  i mention it because arguably it is the largest single committer of capex roughly 18 billion a year was budgeted for 2010 at the same time it is budgeting a headcount cut of 12000 employees in 2010 
the most positive i talked to such as texas instruments are budgeting some opportunistic capex increases but plan no expansion of payrolls for the first half of the year as they feel they can continue to drive productivity higher  the theme of squeezing greater productivity out of existing workers which dave stockton referred to in our last meeting and out of existing assets remains a constant across all of my ceo contacts  for example walmart is planning on adding 11 million square feet of storage space in 2010  yet because of it and other efficiency boosters it will not increase its associated head count above 14 million  it has an enormous employee base  that 14 million is actually down slightly in 2009 from 2008 
regarding retail the container ships that carry goods across the seas are operating below cost and continue to lose money  the rails that take those goods from the ports to their distribution points report stability but no discernible pickup in end demand  and my favorite metric 178000 freight cars which would stretch 2900 miles if laid end to end and 28000 locomotives have been laid up  even though buffett announced this morning that he was acquiring burlington northern the ceo of burlington northern reports that in the same words christmas is dead  these are not happy people that i talked to 
mr plosser thats like philadelphia sports fans laughter 
mr fisher the retailers themselves report continued trends of smaller unit sales at lower prices and a shift to private labels and economy brands over a greater number of transactions with volumes falling off as the month progresses  this is confirmed by mastercards data which show yearoveryear growth of transactions but lower average tickets  pricing power is nil  again going to walmart it reports that food price deflation in its average market basket is 08 percent year over year through this week and has had a third consecutive month of slight deflation in general merchandise  inventories remain lean  they are being managed surgically  there is scant desire to build them overall  stocking is being regeared to justintime response in demand for specific items  and i take note with regard to retailers my bible womens wear daily is reporting that retailers have started laying off workers in the month of october  that is very unusual for the fall season 
there are no complaints from the big boys about accessing the credit markets  indeed they report far more robust and better priced credit markets  americredit which is a company i have started talking to is interesting because it finances purchases of used automobiles and has 900000 customers  it reports that thanks to the talf facility and the improved tone in the abs market its borrowing costs for example have been cut in half  so that is good news but one reactionary theme has emerged as expectedat least as i would expect from the global operators the combination of projected continued dollar weakness and low interest rates earned on excess cash held in dollars is incenting their treasurers to keep their cash balances abroad  that phenomenon should wax and wane over time 
of less topical concern and more disturbing to me is the belief expressed by several that risk adjustments had better prospects for returns by investing capex elsewhere  if you have read the wall street journal recentlyand we will have to check on the accuracyit estimates that the sp 500 companies are carrying 1 trillion in cash on their balance sheets  the last time we had that kind of carry on the balance sheets was the 1960s  as i say this is not your mothers 1960s we live in a globalized world and there are options for investing abroad  i am finding a good many ceos and cfos who are planning to commit to capex and deploy that 1 trillion in buildup in cash plus additional cashflows but very fewin fact none out of the somewhat 30 that i spoke toare planning to commit it here in the united states unless there is greater clarity about future policy initiatives the grapeshot approach that the administration and the congress have followedannouncing so many policy initiativesis adding to uncertainty regarding progressive budgeting and planning for 2010  i might note that those who have spent some time actually interacting with mr summers and others at the white house have come back more concerned than placated and this concern persists  the bottom line is that there is a lot of handwringing and a great deal of hesitancy by my corporate contacts  i would say that the mood is a little less sour but still a little dour and mr chairman these anecdotal soundings do nothing to change my checkmarkshaped forecast 
i continue to expect that after this and the third quarters 3 percent plus growth rates we will settle in 2010 to a slower crawl say to 2 percent with unemployment hanging in at about 97 percent which is i guess at the low end of our central tendency as was presented earlier and only in 2011 will growth ramp up to near and above 4 percent with unemployment lingering above 8 percent well into 2012  now that said these are still positive numbers and they beg the question of whether we should begin deaccommodating earlier rather than later  that we will talk about tomorrow thank you mr chairman   
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  in the fifth district the outlook hasnt changed much since our last meeting so i will be brief  both our manufacturing and services indexes slipped a bit in october but the overall manufacturing index remains in positive territory reports from our directors and other contacts remain decidedly mixed  they say for example that many commercial real estate and banking markets continue to weaken but they are also reporting more optimism in some sectors as well 
national economic reports also seem to remain mixed  we are making progress toward a recovery but clearly not all segments of the economy are participating  commercial construction continues to decline  it is likely to be a drag on growth for some time  people are losing jobs more rapidly than people are finding them  and as long as that is happening average consumers confidence in their income prospects is not likely to increase dramatically  moreover the contribution from the inventory swing to topline growth is bound to fade at some point as is the contribution from the stimulus   
nevertheless i find myself somewhat optimistic though cautiously so  consumer spending seems to be on a moderate upward trend as does the housing market  business investment in equipment and software in the aggregate numbers seems to have stabilized  and the end to the massive inventory liquidation will add at least somewhat to growth in the near term  at this point the distress in commercial real estate seems likely to be relatively manageable for the banking system taken as a whole  and i think the decline in initial claims suggests that the overall job market is likely to bottom out reasonably soon  i also like the fact that inflation seems pretty quiet now 
in closing let me just again note the passage in the bluebook outlining potential sequences of statements going forward  we will talk more about policy tomorrow  i think it does make sense in this environment to look ahead though and to think about potential sequences of events and actions and see if we cant take them on board in crafting our statement today i will also note the expansion of the extended period sentence introducing language that gives at least some suggestion of conditions under which we might start removing accommodation  it would be useful for us to spend a lot of time talking about what we think those conditions might be and reaching a modest consensus on what we could put in the statement about that  i think that would be useful  that concludes my statement mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  much as i indicated in our last meeting the incoming data and reports from my business contacts continue to reflect an economy that is in the early stages of a modest recovery from a deep recession  business activity is expanding and we expect that gdp growth will average 3 to 3 percent over the next year or so  however my contacts are expressing a good deal of uncertainty regarding sales and order flows in the first half of 2010 once the current inventory cycle has largely run its course  in fact although this is a swag to me their reports feel more as though they expect a 2 percent growth rate than my own 2010 projection of 3 percent 
on the positive side businesses are certainly positioned to accelerate production when demand finally does improve as it inevitably will  all industrial segments currently have more than enough capacity in place to meet their nearterm expected sales and order flows  but like president fisher i heard too much commentary from my contacts suggesting that a lack of sustainable orders and sales developments could spark another wave of cutbacks and i suppose your reports actually had those cutbacks in train  this seems like a serious threat  the positive thirdquarter nonfinancial earnings reports were built on cost reductions not revenue expansions  if fourthquarter revenue growth continues to be modest i suspect there is a real possibility of businesses attempting a repeat of the third quarter  for me the odds seem tilted toward further risk aversion on the part of businesses in the first half of 2010 
the financial landscape surrounding bank credit also continues to be a headwind for the outlook this is not a large issue for large highquality firms with direct access to capital markets  they are able to obtain funding at spreads they consider to be closer to normal  but small and mediumsized companies that rely on bank credit continue to complain about onerous terms and an inadequate supply of borrowing options  have you gone out and spoken to your local businesses and community bankers lately  community and regional bankers respond that borrowers credit quality is substantially worse than these businesses acknowledge but they also say that the only way they can improve their capital ratios today is to shrink their assets much as president lacker was talking about bottom line there continues to be a modest credit crunch for small and mediumsized businesses   
with regard to inflation my outlook is unchanged from our last meeting  i continue to expect that core inflation will be flat to down a bit in 201011 but then move up to about 1 percent by 2012 as i discussed at length last time substantial resource slack remains and i suppose we will talk more about that at the december meeting as i understand that agenda  inflation expectations as best i can judge appear to be stable  longerdated measures of expectations derived from surveys spf forecasts for the tips market continue to run in their typical ranges and the stability of these measures stands in contrast to strong countervailing forces for me the risk of an outsized mediumterm increase in inflation seems small especially an increase that threatens price stability  after all core inflation is running currently well below my 2 percent guideline for price stability and the mediumterm prospects are for more of the same  of course we will need to listen intently for changing fundamentals that may alter these risk assessments  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  president yellen 
ms yellen thank you mr chairman  i have been encouraged by the positive tone of recent economic data and continued signs of healing in the financial system  improvements in the housing sector are particularly welcome because they contribute both to economic growth and to mitigating the strains on the financial system  in the corporate bond market risk spreads have come down and that should support business investment for those corporations with access to market financing   
however these encouraging signs are marred by the persistently weak labor market and stagnating wage income  in addition my business contacts too report that bank credit conditions remain tight and most have reined in capital spending limiting expenditures to essential projects and those that promise immediate efficiency improvements  finally some of the recent strength in housing and auto purchases results from temporary government programs  overall the recovery is shaping up as a long difficult slog for several reasons including the extraordinary depth of the recession the pressure on financial firms and households to repair their balance sheets and the zero bounds considerable constraint on monetary policy 
i find myself in agreement with the greenbooks assessment of the outlook for the economy but this is not an outcome that i find at all satisfactory not with unemployment rising to 10 percent this year and remaining above 8 percent through 2011 and inflation below desired levels as far as the eye can see  that said the most frightening downside risks to this forecast have receded and i now view the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced  nevertheless those risks are considerable  
on the upside it is possible that consumers and businesses may be better able and more willing to spend than i have given them credit for  over the past several months we have seen improvements in a number of factors that pulled down consumer spending over the past year  these include uncertainty consumer confidence wealth and credit availability  my staff has estimated consumptionforecasting models that include these variables and their preferred specification generates a forecast for pce growth over the next four quarters of around 5 percent due to the improvement in those factors  because the model misses other forces that are restraining consumer spending i havent adjusted my own baseline forecast up to nearly this extent but this analysis does highlight for me a potential upside risk to the outlook similar to the vshaped recovery discussed in the greenbook 
counterbalancing this upside risk are some significant downside risks  some of the most worrisome ones also relate to consumer spending in particular the stillparlous state of household balance sheets could restrain consumption more than is incorporated in the greenbook in the past i have highlighted the potential drag on consumer spending that we may see if households to rebuild wealth and reduce leverage boost their saving beyond the rather modest rebound incorporated in the greenbook forecast  the united states was one of many countries to experience a massive increase in debttoincome ratios followed by a severe housing bust and a retrenchment in consumption  interestingly crosscountry evidence reveals a remarkably strong correlation between the increase of debt to income before the crisis and the decline in real consumption once the crisis began  i recognize that correlation does not necessarily imply causation but this evidence provides a cautionary note that we may see abnormally low consumer spending for some time 
another downside risk relates to the effect on the banking sector of further deterioration in the commercial real estate market  as many of you have mentioned the prospects for commercial real estate have continued to deteriorate  we estimate that a significant share of banks in our district will fail over the next five years as a consequence  in fact we are concerned that we now have a large number of already economically insolvent zombie banks whose troubles may have seriously impaired their ability to extend credit to the businesses in their communities  in addition lenders are commonly asking borrowers either to repay loans or to provide more equity to offset the erosion of real estate values  and given the very weak conditions in commercial real estate this situation sets the stage for further increases in delinquencies and foreclosures this process could generate an adverse feedback loop akin to that associated with residential real estate 
so in summary the economic outlook remains very uncertain but i think the tail risks and their associated costs have receded to the point that the risks for growth are now balanced 
turning to inflation the basic story has not changed much since our last meeting  i expect substantial slack in labor and goods markets to reduce core pce price inflation from about 1 percent this year to 1 percent in 2010 and 2011  the risks to this forecast are roughly balanced as well but i am very concerned by the sharp deceleration we have seen in wages over the past year and that is a development that is echoed by comments from my directors  they report that wages are flat or even slightly down with no increases in sight 
against this backdrop of substantial slack a key factor putting a floor on the decline in the inflation rate is the publics confidence that we will do whatever it takes to bring the economy back from recession and keep inflation from falling too low  if we waiver from that pledge and tighten too soon confidence in our commitment to economic recovery and price stability could be undermined and that could be a recipe for an extended episode of disinflation or even deflation like the one japan suffered through  a commitment to low and stable inflation involves defending the inflation objective on both the upside and the downside   
a concern in this regard is the fact that implied forward rates from fed funds futures contracts now suggest that market participants expect us to start raising rates as early as next spring this assessment however depends critically on the assumption that term premiums and fed funds futures contracts are very low by historical standardsabout 1 basis point per month  this assumption seems questionable given evidence that historically these term premiums appear to have varied considerably and estimated risks and term premiums on a wide range of assets are now quite elevated 
my staff just recently completed the development of a new model of the term structure of treasury yields and has used it to back out estimates of expected future short rates and the term premium on fed funds futures  they find that the term premium on fed funds futures has risen substantially and is currently much higher than 1 basis point per month  the implication in contrast to the usual interpretation from futures is that market participants currently expect a relatively shallow path for the funds rate similar to that in the desks primary dealer survey  these expectations exceed but are closer to my own views concerning the appropriate course of policy given what we now know of course our policy decisions must depend on how economic developments actually unfold  but if we signal a tightening of policy before it is justified by the evolution of inflation and economic slack in the economy perhaps partly out of concern that market participants see us as getting behind the curve we could upset confidence in our policies cause longerterm rates to rise and end up in a more dangerous deflationary situation 
vice chairman dudley may i ask a question 
chairman bernanke yes 
vice chairman dudley  you said much more than 1 basis point  can you give me a rough order of magnitude 
ms yellen i think the order of magnitude is about 3 or 4 basis points a month over the next year or two 
vice chairman dudley  okay thanks 
chairman bernanke okay thank you we are halfway through our goround it is 545  maybe this is a good time to adjourn for today  we will start tomorrow at 900 am there is a reception up in the cafeteria followed by dinner 
meeting recessed 

november 4 2009morning session 
chairman bernanke good morning everyone  let me just start with a few items before we go into the rest of the goround  just first one data point the adp employment number this morning was minus 203000 which the stock market viewed as a decent number  we have a small correction from yesterdays presentation  brian 
mr madigan yes mr chairman  yesterday we reported that talf loans declined 10 percent over the intermeeting period because of repayments of talf loans  that decline actually applied to talf loans backed by abs  we want to note that the decline in talf loans backed by abs was offset by an increase in talf loans backed by cmbs  so on balance over the intermeeting period talf loans were flat 
chairman bernanke with your indulgence also as i said yesterday we want to inquire to get the views of all members on some of the issues that were raised in the presentations yesterday but i think there are a few noncontroversial items and maybe we can just very quickly see if everybody is okay with them and just simplify the process  so let me just try to get a little feedback quickly 
the most number of issues were raised about the swap lines and i think we need to have a full memorandum to you on those issues  obviously there were questions both about how to define the line how to deal with the north american counterparties and so on  so we will send you a memo on this and ask for a thoughtful response  if there is no objection though i think the staff would appreciate it if they could continue their informal nonbinding talks with the four major central banks  in any case this is part of the process of winding down the existing lines  if there is no objection okay  that is the swap lines 
on the material relating to various lending programs we mentioned that we plan to consider shortening the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 28 days  that would be announced soon and presumably be effective after yearend  i didnt hear any commentary on that was anyone concerned about that  seeing nonethough if you do have any comments by all means let us know in the next week or so 
the other point that was raised was that the staff wanted input on publishing a federal register notice on the term deposits which would ask for input on how to structure those term deposits of course again this is nonbinding it is just for information  i propose that we would circulate the proposed language to the committee and ask for any feedback on that  but we will move ahead with developing a notice and then circulating that for any concerns 
okay finally on the other issues relating to the reverse repos and so onthe staff suggested prioritizing reverse repos and term deposits and putting rcas the collateralized accounts on hold for the time being  i didnt hear any objection to that  are there any concerns about that  let me say for myself that putting it on hold doesnt mean killing it  i think we ought to maintain all of our options  the rcas are meant to address a specific issue that we had earlier which was the gses and the problems that their excess liquidity might cause for us in managing the shortterm interest rate  but this is just a prioritization for the short term  any concerns   
okay and on the reverse repos there was some discussion of who would be the counterparties i think what we heard from this were a couple of things  first in order to get this going soon we should probably prioritize the highvolume counterparties as the first step  but second we should plan to include a broader set of counterparties and we should be developing criteria for doing that  governor warsh mentioned using the private sector as one particular possibility that we should explore assuming that we are going to go forward with this today which i believe we want to we would want to continue our testing process  i promised yesterday that we wouldnt make final decisions so if anybody is uncomfortable with it or would just like to have more time please say so  are those things okay 
mr evans mr chairman 
chairman bernanke yes 
mr evans just so i can understand this a little more clearly where do the money market mutual funds enter into that prioritization  that seems to be where a large pool of funds might come from 
chairman bernanke i think that they would be a high priority  those are the major sources of funding  but i guess the question would be do we go first to the fidelitys and so on  at some point we should try to make sure that any money market mutual fund with an interest should have access either directly or indirectly  but in the interest of monetary policy implementation in the very short run we would start with the larger ones 
mr evans i agree thank you 
chairman bernanke okay 
mr lacker mr chairman 
chairman bernanke all right  yes president lacker 
mr lacker  so we are not going down this path it is just testing still  we are not making a commitment to any particular volume of reverse repurchases 
chairman bernanke absolutely not  this is just making sure we have a working tool 
mr lacker okay 
chairman bernanke is everybody okay all right  thank you very much  we are ready to continue where we left off on the goround  president hoenig i think that you are next 
mr hoenig thank you mr chairman  conditions in our district and my views on the outlook havent changed a lot since last time  on the region i think the operative words there are moderately improve and you can kind of go through that  we have seen our manufacturing moderately improve driven by new orders and some orientation toward exports  actually there has been some hiring in manufacturing but that is mixed  of course you get some hiring and you get some layoffs  so in a sense that is pretty stable but not improving dramatically at all  housing has also improved  how much that is related to the homebuyers credit is not clear but we do see improvement  our big downside in the region is commercial real estate and that is going to remain so for at least a couple of years we think  our energy sector has also moderately improved oil particularly  our natural gas which is a big part of it still has plenty of supply depending on the season that will be effective  but one thing about the energy industry is that they have been very able in terms of current independence to renegotiate their lines they have had no trouble getting those renewed  our labor markets on balance are still weak but they are not declining as indicated perhaps by this mornings numbers  one other thing i would comment on our larger companies do have fairly sizable cash balances for capex they are talking about maintaining and spending to maintain but not expanding at this point as well 
on the national economy our outlook for gdp is not unlike that of the greenbook  we have a little more modest growth in 2010 and then it picks up  we also have an assumption in there where policy is less accommodating sooner  still we see modest growth going forward and in that environment a very modest pickup in inflation over the next couple of years  and other than that things are stable moving forward and i will leave it at that for now  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  while i am pleased by the output gains that the economy posted last quarter i do remain concerned about how the economy will develop over the coming year  so in preparation for this meeting i focused my discussions with my business contacts on the question how sustainable are the thirdquarter growth figures 
despite many signs that housing prices and sales of existing homes are stabilizing home builders in my district are still largely anticipating a bleak outlook for 2010  they noted that their interest costs for holding land continue to rise even while the value of that land has sagged  small builders reported that the increase in housing starts that we saw in the third quarter is due in large part to the fact that big builders are working off land inventories and then selling their homes at firesale prices  these smaller builders do not see the gains that we saw in housing starts as sustainable 
the commercial real estate developers realtors and investors fundamentally view their circumstances as dire and they see a lot more pain ahead  i am not expecting commercial construction to add to gdp next year but beyond that it is going to take a lot of skill by many people to resolve the commercial real estate problems in an orderly way  the problems in the commercial real estate sector add another dimension of uncertainty to my outlook 
although consumption figures picked up notably in the third quarter many of my contacts stressed the continuing effects of weakened household balance sheets on consumer spending a national apparel and personal care retailer confirmed this perspective by noting that households are turning from credit cards to debit cards to rein in their spending   
an auto insurer in my district reported that households are registering and insuring fewer automobiles as households try to reduce their expenses  the insurer also reported that more customers stopped making payments after they received confirmation of having insurance or proof of insurance demands for these services are lower but this insurer emphasized that the patterns that he is seeing reflect general ongoing stress that is evident in household balance sheets the progress that is evident in consumer spending in the third quarter seems unlikely to be sustained without notable progress on employment 
i think that reports like these make it hard to extrapolate forward the full strength in the thirdquarter growth rate  so while my forecast has good growth in the third quarter which i think was aided by many government interventions my expectations for the fourth quarter and for next year are for less growth than is in the greenbook projection  in my outlook the recovery does not build momentum until the second half of 2010  the restraints on economic growth in my projections stem primarily from the continued weakness in both residential and commercial construction and a slow recovery in consumer spending  despite the weaker output path that i have in my projection my unemployment rate does look very close to the greenbooks 
my projection for inflation hasnt changed materially in response to the recent good news in output core inflation rates continue to sag despite stable inflation expectations  the median cpi has declined over the past several months which points to the influence that the economic slack is having on current pricing  i appreciate that others correctly point out that output gaps have not always been reliable in forecasting inflation  but the compensation data show plenty of evidence that economic slack is currently affecting our economy  indeed based on the rate of productivity growth that i expect we will see posted for the third quarter it seems that unit labor costs have fallen sharply  fortunately inflation expectations havent declined which helped to prevent some of the downward pressure that we are seeing from converting into sharper deflation in consumer prices  still my outlook for core pce inflation is that it will dip below 15 percent in 2010 and only gradually increase toward 2 percent in 2011  in sum i view the risks around my outlook as balanced  the risks to my outlook for inflation remain balanced because i think that shifting inflation expectations could go in either direction  even if we have seen stable inflation expectations to date we could as president bullard pointed out in his memo experience an expectation shock in this highly unusual economic environment 
on output growth i have shifted my balance of risks from downside to balanced  i still harbor the concern that the momentum we are currently seeing may fade more quickly than i currently have in my outlook  but the strength in the thirdquarter data also shows that surprises to the upside are possible notably export growth has been a surprise in the third quarter and stronger world growth as nathan pointed out yesterday would boost my outlook considerably  and as the greenbook points out we just dont have a lot of experience with systemic financial shocks and perhaps the economy will prove to be more resilient to these shocks next year than i currently expect thank you mr chairman   
chairman bernanke thank you  president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota thank you mr chairman  i want to begin by thanking the chairman for his generous introduction yesterday  it is an incredible honor to be a participant in this discussion and i am looking forward to working with all of you both today and in the meetings to come 
in the ninth district real economic activity is stable but subdued  unemployment did fall considerably in minnesota from august to september from 8 percent to 73 percent and minnesota has a majority of the population in the ninth district  however unemployment remained elevated in the rest of the district although i should say that unemployment has been low in the ninth district relative to national averages elsewhere except in the upper peninsula of michigan 
the information from our directors about their local communities is consistent with this mixed picture  our directors report that our consumers remain cautious about spending  one reported that shipping was dormant in duluth through much of the summer before picking up in late september which if you are familiar with duluth you know is very late in the shipping season for them  the directors generally agreed that things had stopped getting worse but they also agreed that they did not actually see them getting that much better 
nationally an advance estimate of thirdquarter gdp growth was better than expected at 3 percent  this increase followed four quarters of negative growth  as a consequence output is well below its trend levels if we assume that trend grows at 3 percent per year beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 of course 2007 represents a peak so you may not want to draw your trend line from that point  given that it is worth noting that output remains well below a 3 percent trend line that begins at the end of the 200001 recession  the greenbook predicts that gdp will rise 39 percent per year over the next two years  based on our minneapolis models forecast i believe that prediction is optimistic if anything  but even if it were right gdp will be well below this 200001 trend line of 3 percent through the end of 2011  of course it is an important question whether this discrepancy is attributable to a fall in the efficient level of output or to the effect of price and wage rigidities  i will leave that question open  unemployment has stabilized in the past three months  however it remains extremely high by historical standards at nearly 10 percent i agree with the greenbook that it will remain elevated through 2011  the employmentpopulation ratio remains at a 25year low 
there is good news inflation remains low  inflation expectations as measured by blue chip forecasts or tips spreads also remain low  however i am concerned about a tail risk in inflation the size of government debt held in the private sector has increased over 30 percent in the past two years  there is a positive probability that fiscal imbalances of this kind will give rise to significant inflationary pressures  the news is also good in financial markets  spreads in the interbank lending market have tightened considerably  the spread between jumbo mortgage loans and conforming mortgage loans remains elevated but has fallen sharply since the first part of the year house prices are stabilizing and if you believe the caseshiller numbers may actually be rising in much of the country  
so overall i would say the real side of the economy is recovering somewhat  the trend in gdp is well below historical norms unemployment is well above historical norms and this characterization seems likely to continue well into 2011  inflation is under control and is expected to remain so although the size of the government debt remains a possible large risk  financial markets continue to improve and i see them as being much stronger than a year ago  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you im sorry i dont want to put you on the spot but i was just interested in your view on the relationship of government debt to inflation  do you take the fiscal theory of the price level as related here monetization excess demand  i was just curious 
mr kocherlakota basically when you have large government debt as you know there are going to be two ways to pay it off  there is a third way which is not to pay it off laughter but lets keep to the two ways of paying it off  one is to pay it off by real tax collections and the other way is to monetize i think private markets will be concerned about whether or not we will be monetizing and that will influence inflation expectations and the realization of inflation 
chairman bernanke thank you vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you  the economy appears to be evolving very close to what we expected real gdp is expanding at a moderate rate but some of the supportive elements such as the swing in the inventory cycle and special programs like cashforclunkers and the firsttime homebuyer tax credit are temporary and thus may exaggerate the underlying strength of the economy  at the same time potential retardants such as the decline in household net worth the high level of household indebtedness and the constraints on credit availability do not appear to have subsided since the last meeting  financial conditions broadly defined have not changed significantly either  generally i would think as the economy improves that we would actually expect to see an easing of financial conditions  so the fact that that hasnt happened over the intermeeting period is slightly disturbing 
the inflation outlook has not changed materially either  the core pce deflator has risen only 13 percent over the past year down more than a percentage point from a year ago  moreover cost pressures are very subdued with the employment cost index for civilian workers rising only 1 percent over the past four quarters  and the high unemployment rate implies to me that these wage pressures are likely to be muted for a long time  modest growth in compensation per hour combined with the spike in productivity growth means that unit labor costs are falling quite rapidly thus i think we are where we were at the last fomc meeting many quarters away from any need to tighten monetary policy 
that said we should recognize that we are already tightening on at least two dimensions  first a number of government support programs are ending and we are tightening the terms of our liquidity programs  second the treasury purchase program has been completed and the agency debt and agency mbs purchases are on track to taper off by the end of the first quarter  that underscores the need for caution at this moment 
with respect to the agency mbs purchase program i am where brian sack is on this  i expect that the optionadjusted spread will widen somewhat going forward  it is difficult to sort out the timing of this widening because it depends on the relative weight one assigns to stock versus flow effects but i suspect that traders will view the current spread level as unsustainable causing them to go short agency mbs or short to spread which would be long treasuries and short agency mbs on an anticipation of a backup in the yield or spread with the end of the program  i am not sure when this process will start but i would not be surprised at all if we did not see some widening in the spread by our january meeting  of course if that happens that is likely to lead to somewhat higher mortgage rates and that will inhibit the nations housing recovery 
a few comments on president bullards note on output gaps  first i think it is great that he is writing memos like that and circulating them to the rest of the committee  i think it is really important to understand where we agree and where we differ and i think these memos help to sharpen that point that said i do find it unconvincing that the output gap after the 198182 recession could be less than 1 percentage point as shown in figure 4 of his memo  theoretical models maybe can generate that result but that makes me doubt the theoretical models not take that figure in hand  it would imply that the nairu moved virtually hand in hand with the rise in the actual unemployment rate and i think that is quite unlikely 
second i continue to be disturbed in president bullards framework about what is the true underlying model  what drives short and mediumterm inflation expectations when you commented yesterday you said its the feds credibility but then what drives the feds credibility  and how do we close the model  i certainly agree that inflation expectations are very important  i think we all agree on that but if those expectations depend in part on current and expected future output gaps then you cant completely ignore the output gap 
third in the memo president bullard suggested that the housing bubble could be interpreted as a large upward deviation from the normal or potential level of output  the idea is that real gdp overshoots potential during the boom by roughly the amount of the unsustainable output in housing  i dont really understand that  if housing was a bubble and we produced too much housing this does not mean that potential output was much lower  we could have produced things other than housing we presumably had the capacity to move around resources labor and capital to do so so the housing bubble to my mind did not materially change potential output only the composition of actual output  that is how i would look at it 
fourth the behavior of core inflation measures following recessions is pretty compelling  in the united states on average the core inflation rate has fallen about 2 percentage points during the first 18 months of an economic expansion  if we take the worstcase cycle from our perspective of inflation core inflation rose about  percentage point  so there is a lot of variance cycle to cycle but overall the evidence is pretty compelling that core inflation tends to fall during the early phases of economic expansions 
in general i think the empirical evidence for output gaps and inflation is less than decisive for some very obvious reasons  one we dont have many business cycles to study  yes there are many years of data but not many business cycles  second we measure inflation and output gaps poorly and third there is oftentimes not much variability in our measures of core inflation and output gaps that is certainly true of the last couple of cycles  thus it is not surprising to me that it is hard to find a robust empirical relationship  but that is different from saying that there isnt a relationship  i am pretty confident now that inflation is low and the output gap is high thus i expect the historical experience to hold during early recovery periods core inflation is more likely to fall than to rise  is that absolutely certain  of course not we just dont have enough data to be absolutely confident  and other factors that influence inflation expectations could derail such an outcome but we have to go with what we know now  if it turns out that this cycle starts to evolve very differently then we will have to adjust in a timely manner 
my perspective is simple  the unemployment rate is very high core inflation is low  given our dual mandate and the stability of longterm inflation expectations this implies that our focus should be on getting the unemployment rate down and that this is likely to be our focus for an extended period thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  incoming data on economic activity seem consistent with not only an expanding economy but also one that will strengthen gradually with a slow decline in unemployment from very elevated levels  so although my forecast has strengthened since june it still has as many of you have remarked the same basic contour that it has had for some timepresident fishers checkmark contour 
i think the good news was that final demand if anything was a bit stronger than expected reinforcing the impression that the upturn is underpinned by more than an inventory correction with consumption outside autos and orders for capital equipment moving higher  but as i noted there are reasons for sticking with the outlook for only a gradual strengthening  the surprise in consumption came at the expense of a sharperthanexpected fall in the saving rate which does not seem sustainable or repeatable  i agree with the staff forecast that the saving rate is likely to rise over coming quarters as households adjust to lower wealth uncertain job prospects and less available credit 
payrolls and initial claims suggest that the job market remains quite weak  the effects of this on incomes and on confidence are likely to be felt for some time  there is no evidence yet that other forms of spending are likely to expand rapidly enough to fill the gap left by lower levels of consumption out of income for some time  the housing market looks better but starts and permits have only leveled out and vacancy rates remain quite high  high vacancy rates and financial constraints will weigh on nonresidential construction for some time  restraint on the growth of consumption along with excess capacity will hold down accelerator effects on business investment  and net exports were still a negative contributor to gdp in the third quarter despite the pickup in growth abroad 
financial market developments over the intermeeting period also continue to point to financial constraints on the increase in demand  as dave stockton noted a sustained improvement in financial marketsincluding the greater availability of bank credit a further decline in creditrisk premiums and a rise in equity pricesare important preconditions for even the gradual strengthening of demand in the greenbook forecast  most especially bank credit remains quite tight  on the quantity side bank lending continued to decline very rapidly and growth in the monetary aggregates was modest  a good deal of the drop in bank loans undoubtedly reflects demand weakness but the senior loan officer opinion survey indicated that banks continue to cut back on all kinds of credit lines and they continue to tighten standards albeit by a smaller plurality than before  and on the price side of bank credit a considerable margin of banks reported a further tightening of spreads on business loans  many banks continue to struggle with loan losses and it will take some time before they rebuild capital and become more comfortable increasing the supply of credit 
in securities markets the pace of improvement slowed amid questions about the strength of the recovery  the decline in equity prices in the past two weeks as well as the small rebound in the dollar and a decline in some commodity prices suggests to me a healthy appreciation of the likely gradual pickup in the economy and the risks around it  but it also implies a slowing in the financial market impetus to recovery   
although im at the upper end of the central tendency on growth i find myself at the lower end of the central tendencies on inflation  i had core inflation drifting down further over the next two years to 1 percent reflecting the effects of a lot of slack in utilization of capital and labor resources  like everyone else im looking forward to the discussion in december  i agree that slack and output gaps are hard to measure  potential supply could be and probably is being held down by some of the frictions associated with the required reallocation of capital and labor resources as construction financial and consumer goods and services sectors shrink while net exports and business investments slowly fill the gap  and financial constraints might inhibit the ability of small businessesin particular in sectors that are benefiting from shifts in demandfrom expanding plant and staffing  but the surprising strength in productivity suggests that firms are able to do more with less and that provides a countervailing boost to potential gdp 
data on core inflation over the intermeeting period continued to come in quite damped and we have experienced a percentage point or more of core disinflation over the past year while all of these adverse influences on potential supply were already in play  as a number of you have remarked the growth in labor compensation is decelerating quite remarkably  all of this has occurred while inflation expectations have been very well anchored  stable expectations will mute the effect of slack will flatten the phillips curve but something has been pressuring inflation lower while expectations have been stable and i infer that it is primarily a large margin of slackof excess supply  furthermore i confess to being one of the two people who saw the balance of risks around my inflation forecast as tilted to the downside  if energy prices follow the futures market path actual inflation will be quite low for a long time and expectations could become unanchored but on the downside 
i recognize that there are upside risks on the inflation forecast as well  to my mind they are primarily around a feedback loop from the dollar to commodity prices to headline inflation to inflation expectations  some decline in the dollar is a necessary part of the rebalancing of global demand  we need some expenditureshifting to get that rebalancing although it would be preferable if the rising currencies were among the surplus countries of asia  and commodity prices should rise some as the global economy recuperates especially with the recovery led by resourceusing economies of asia  but the risk is that a loss of confidence in the dollar and its purchasing power becomes selfreinforcing feedback on inflation expectations  we do not see this yet  i dont expect it in response to moderate declines in the dollar and the rise in raw materials prices but it is a risk that we will need to be especially attentive to  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you governor warsh   
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  as i said when we last met i expected more strength in the next couple of quarters than in the next couple of years and i still believe that  im skeptical of linear improvements that are outlined in the greenbook in a world that looks as though it is filled with all sorts of nonlinear risks  the extraordinary stimulus from public authorities fiscal monetary and otherand the even more extraordinary run in financial markets have substantially improved the likely arithmetic of gdp in the next couple of quarters  but if we dont see moreimpressive signs of improved income and jobs and more impressive signs of business fixed investmentparticularly now when marketinduced stimulus governmentinduced stimulus and a cyclical improvement in the economy are peakingthen i have to admit to being more cautious about growth prospects in the second half of 2010 and in 2011 
let me spend a little time on the real economy and then turn to financial markets and financial institutions and maybe a last word on inflation  on the real economy obviously as many of you have discussed the data are mixed but trending toward recovering but it still looks like a subpar recovery  i continue to think that we should be seeing moresubstantial improvement sooner in order to get more comfortable that we have a durable recovery at hand  i am not as persuaded as the greenbook forecast suggests that the handoff from the public sector to the private sector will happen as seamlessly or as steadily as predicted  now there is certainly plenty of good news that we can talk about  the fortune 500 nonfinancials are in great shape  strong balance sheets better position coming out of this recession than in the last two for certain highly productive significant operating leverage and still awaiting topline growth and if it comes that would have a huge impact on their willingness to invest 
the ism and other surveys show manufacturing improving with inventories rebuilding  but on the other side real incomes are still declining even as pce was bolstered by car and housing subsidies the job engine to me looks stalled or maybe worse and global trade appears to me still years away from reaching its prior peak  and we are still seeing constrained credit availability to small businesses and households as governor kohn talked about and little impetus for increases in business fixed investment   
it is normally the case that improvements in share prices drive ceos to be much more forward leaning on capex than they appear to be at the present time  and now when i talk about financial markets i would suggest that the greenbook supposition which i think is rightwhich is that further improvements in the real economy are contingent on further improvements in financial marketslooks to me to be anything but a sure bet  i think the schizophrenia that we have seen in the markets particularly in the last couple of weeks with preoccupation with one issue one day and with another issue the next day reminds us that the revaluation process of every asset everywhere in the world is still incomplete  i try not to overread or underread what financial markets have been telling us in the last couple of weeks  one overread of this new move down in markets and increased volatility is that oh you know the markets got ahead of themselves and there is a big correction in front of us  to underread it would say well markets go up and markets go down and theres not much to worry about 
my own sense is that were probably in a new phase in financial market developments  financial market improvements from here will be more driven by policy and by economic fundamentals and less driven by the kind of asset reallocations that weve seen and the catchingup by active investors who are trying to catch up with indexes the oneway upward move by financial markets from march lows in all likelihood looks substantially complete both in the united states and elsewhere  it is hard to predict where these markets will go but i would suggest that real economic fundamentals and the contour of public policies will probably knock these markets around for a while and so i am hesitant to suggest that the next several months will look as satisfying as the last several months in these markets 
at the time of the last fomc i said that markets were nondistinguishingthey were willing to fund virtually all issuers throughout the worldthat the openness in these markets was remarkable and that those issuers that took advantage would be quite fortunate  i said that others will regret standing on the sidelines  from the march lows until the last fomc meeting we saw a 4 trillion increase in the value of publicly traded us assets  that is of significant consequence to the real economy and could help and is helping offset weak incomes  i think the next 4 trillion will be a lot harder to come by 
we can no longer count on the meltingup in these markets to do the hard work of helping repair balance sheets of financial institutions and households  still in all likelihood in this move up the first 4 trillion is likely to stick around for a while  so i dont want to suggest that were not going to get ongoing benefits but i do think that the financial market trajectory is likely to get tougher i am a little disappointed that this move in these asset prices hasnt done more to help the real economy get back on its front foot  im a little disappointed that it hasnt helped durable final demand  and i think the fourthquarter data will be very instructive  if the fourthquarter gdp arithmetic still shows an incredible reliance on governmentinduced stimulus even after this rally then again i hesitate about how optimistic to be on projections in the outyears 
the haves and havenots in financial markets are likely to be more obvious in the weeks and months ahead  as brian sack said in his introduction this change in market sentiment this retrenchment is probably healthy for the long term but the increasing gloss of asset values will wear thin and broken business models and underachievement by many firms may be met with a skeptical even punitive eye by market participants  and we are likely to see a change in correlation among asset prices that was confounding many of us when we last met 
let me turn finally to financial institutions and then a brief word on inflation  the global financial architecture remains unclear  impediments to financial institutions getting back to the business of banking are meaningful  what we are seeing in some parts of the world particularly europe and the united kingdom are discussions both at the behest of governments and in some cases at the behest of shareholders to decide whether some of these large financial institutions should be broken up  in the united states neither markets nor most government actors are demanding resizing or rescoping of large financial institutions  but as we approach an evennumbered year an election year in washington i will be surprised if there isnt more scrutiny around that deconglomeration hypothesis  in the near term equity and credit markets are likely to be more distinguishing as i mentioned and there is great interest in providing capital to these financial institutions so long as the capital is in the last round  the success of us banks in funding themselves is really about convincing markets that this is the last equity raise theyll need to do and the extent to which they can pull that off or not strikes me as more challenging than it was six weeks ago 
on the inflation front the weakness on the real side of the economy is certainly driving wages down is certainly having an impact on what were seeing from our inflation readings both recent and going forward  this change in wageprice levels however may be partially offset by relatively higher import prices including yearoveryear increases in energy and other commodities  i think we have a natural experiment that is likely to confront us in the upcoming couple of quarters and it will be important to gauge whether changes in headline prices due in part to rises in energy and other commodity costs at a time of large central bank balances at a time of an unsustainable fiscal picture and at a time of debt limit discussions that are likely to preoccupy the floor of the us senate whether all of that in a natural experiment finds its way into core prices or affects broader measures of inflation expectations  so i think we might have a good look on whether headline prices somehow converge to core or whether core drifts toward headline  i think that will be an interesting point of contact for us to think about the risks to the inflation outlook going forward  thank you   
chairman bernanke thank you  governor duke 
ms duke thank you mr chairman  none of the bankers that i talked with were particularly optimistic but as i went back and looked at all of the responses together i was actually a bit more optimistic laughter  buried in these bleak thirdquarter earnings were actually a couple of positives the margins are higher because of lower deposit rates and better loan spreads theyre earning record mortgageloan originations and expensereduction efforts are beginning to pay off all of these positives are being offset by high credit costs and reserve levels that are overshadowing their positive nature  they describe their credit cost as approaching a plateau rather than a peak auto loans are actually looking quite a bit stronger  credit card losses are stabilizing but will remain at high levels  they believe they are three to six months away from a slowdown in new mortgage and home equity delinquencies with four to six months after that to begin actually working the levels down  but they are cautiously optimistic that the ultimate losses will not be as high as the more stressed scenarios had indicated and most of the builtin nonaccruals are now coming from incomeproducing real estate which take longer to work out but tend to have less severity of loss 
the residential real estate market is actually showing real signs of firming  inventories are in better shape approaching the sixmonth level which indicates balance the existing home inventories at 7 months supply and new home inventories at 7 months  supplies are probably even more sharply stratified by price point  one bank had looked at it in its market  houses over 1 million had a 5year supply from 500000 to 1 million a 30month supply and under 500000 a 5month supply  and while the price points will be different in different markets i think the fundamentals are conceptually the same 
property is moving when it comes into oreo  current buyers are both investors and owneroccupiers with an estimate of firsttime homebuyers making up about 20 percent the investors who are buying judge the bottom of the market by time on the market number of offers and the sales price to the asking price and all of these are currently signaling a bottom i heard some complaints when i was in california that the banks were taking cash offers at less than offers from owneroccupiers who needed financing  one large servicer said that loan investors did originally have a preference for cash offers because of concerns about the loans closing but this is changing and now theyre looking for the best offer   
the greenbook forecast for house prices includes more price softening in anticipation of a spike in foreclosure inventories but there is at least the possibility that we wont see a spike just a steady supply  the pace of foreclosure activity actually varies by firms given their modification strategies and their capabilities  it also varies based on the foreclosure laws in various geographies with judicial foreclosure states lagging and it varies based on market  some of the hardesthit markets are actually seeing the most firming with florida being the clear outlier and likely to be a black hole for some time to come 
even residential construction is improving  the large regionals have worked their balances down 70 to 80 percent  properties that had no buyers before are now moving  there are some reports of better pricing and other reports of stable pricing but more buyers  and whereas the last time there were a couple of reports of lot sales now there are widespread reports of lot sales for entrylevel product 
the incomeproducing property front is still deteriorating with a notable recent deterioration in multifamily  they expect higher nonperformers but lower loss severity and point out that when you have cash flow you at least have options for workout  also the distress is due to economic fundamentals rather than overbuilding  the new cre guidance will help but in my opinion it does not go far enough  the classification analysis does start with determination of debtservice capability rather than collateral value requires a writedown of the loan to the collateral value less selling expenses whenever the debt service is insufficient but only when it is insufficient and recognizes that cash flow from incomeproducing properties might fully support some portion of the loan  but it permits the portion to be graded as a pass only if the bank has formally restructured the loan into two parts a good loan and a bad loan  i believe that banks would be more willing to make new loans and renew or extend existing loans if the classification system were driven by underlying economics rather than the contractual terms of the loans 
i asked all the banks about their excess reserve positions  all were net positive cash and most were happy with the current level and proud of their efforts to get there  when asked what actions they might take if they wanted to reduce the position they said that they would bid less for deposits and several would reduce public funds  some would buy agency and agency mbs although several expressed concern about what happens when we exit and none would grow loans  several expressed uncertainty about the level of demand deposits when the fdic unlimited guaranty expires and most are intentionally shrinking the bank in the face of uncertainty about capital 
capital is available but expensive with larger banks generally available midsize banks on and off and small banks very difficult  one bank had raised part of the money needed for tarp repayment and elected to keep the rest of their tarp funds rather than take the extreme level of dilution it would require to fully repay  they are uncertain about what future capital requirements might look like and uncertain about what will be likely to count as capital and while they are concerned about credit risk their willingness to make new loans is driven at least in part by regulatory considerations  theyll take only pristine credits customers that they want for the long term not solving immediate problems  theyre looking for relationships and theyre particularly concerned about examiner downgrades  you could have an argument about whether the examiners are being overly tough or the bankers are being overly optimistic but there does appear to be a disconnect in their view of the appropriate loan grades  in the snc portfolio the staff reported that the banks and examiners generally identified the same loans as having weaknesses but the examiners graded those loans lower than the banks  the investment banks had much higher downgrades with the examiners feeling that they could estimate credit agency ratings much more accurately than exam ratings 
faced with the new credit card law they had a sharp decline in solicitations  the go to rate on new solicitations is 300 basis points in relation to prime higher than it was before the new law although the reduction in available credit may be misleading  one bank insisted that most were inactive cards  smaller banks are concerned about the new hoepa rules with 6 percent now a highpriced loan which means they cant do balloon payments and they have no capability of escrowing taxes and insurance  so they are reporting that theyre going to have to quit making those loans  in summary we could see improvement in loan performance next year but we are a very long way off from a recovery in bank lending  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  first let me say that ill be brief  second let me say that i mean it  laughter  i think little has changed on net since our last meeting and this unremarkable story strikes me as itself unremarkable because the outlook for moderate growth in the next few quarters has been relatively clear for a while  as to the second half of 2010 and beyond though while the forecast of modestly to moderately abovetrend growth remains eminently plausible there is considerable uncertainty  factors such as the waning of stimulus effects the continued drag on consumption engendered by high unemployment and the travails of the commercial real estate market could well lead to a more sluggish pace of growth  on the other hand as ive said at each of the last couple of meetings despite these significant downside risks i dont discount entirely the possibility of a more rapid pace of recovery 
turning to price stability the story is similar  substantial clarity for the neartomedium term with low levels of inflation and then more uncertainty thereafter  i have my doubts that an unwelcome level of inflation could take hold in the absence of either a rapid acceleration in job growth that got us at least within shouting distance of full employment or a big exogenous shock in the form of much higher commodity prices  but i acknowledge that the unusual characteristics of a recession following a financial crisis and the consequent policy responses may make past experience less than dispositive  and i would add that i am less convinced than i would like to be that recent exchange rate developments are wholly benign  i think they bear watching 
to conclude by referring to our statutory dual mandate maximum employment is not remotely in sight  concerns about deflation have substantially receded though they have not disappeared entirely  concerns about inflation seem at this point to be based more on anticipation than on observation  but im happy to join others in continuing to keep watch  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you very much and thanks to everybody for their valuable input  let me make an effort to summarize the discussions i heard at least and then ill make a few additional comments 
participants noted the recent morepositive economic data  after four quarters of decline we have seen positive economic growth again as had been anticipated and moderate gdp growth should continue in the fourth quarter  factors contributing to growth in the near term include the ongoing slowdown in the pace of inventory decumulation fiscal actions to support autos and housing and some signs of life in consumer spending 
however as many oneoff factors affected final demand in the third quarter it is difficult to separate the signal from the noise leaving considerable uncertainty about the strength of the recovery going forward  most participants see the economy growing at a moderate pace in 2010 a pace that would imply a very slow decline in unemployment  risks to the economic growth outlook are roughly balanced with conditions in financial and labor markets posing threats to growth but the possibility of a stronger consumer and strong productivity growth creating upside risks  concerns remain about the dependence of the economy on government support and the ability of the economy to deliver a selfsustaining recovery without that support  one participant characterized the likely recovery as a long slog and one thought of it as a checkmark which we will continue to evaluate  the emerging global recovery especially in emerging markets is supportive of economic growth here 
with respect to inflation the risks seem roughly balanced as well with some arguing that slack will lead to declining core inflation and others noting that rising energy prices policy expectations and inflation expectations that may not be as anchored as we would like are upside risks some saw slower inflation in the near term but upside risks further out  consumer spending is modestly stronger even outside autos  however weak labor markets the poor condition of household balance sheets declines in net worth and tight credit are drags on sentiment and the ability to spend labor income is flat as hours decline and wage growth slows  how the saving rate will evolve is difficult to anticipate but further declines in the saving rate from here do seem unlikely 
housing activity has improved and house prices have risen modestly in some areas  inventories of housing are down and we may have seen a bottom  however factors such as the firsttime homebuyer tax credit and fed mbs purchases may be driving that trend to some extent  builders especially smaller builders remain pessimistic 
business owners generally remain quite cautious and continue to focus on cost savings in the absence of significant topline revenue growth  the resulting productivity gains have been impressive  however there is substantial reluctance to hire or invest except possibly abroad due to uncertainty about prospective demand and about washingtons grapeshot approach to policy  continued strengths in parts of the global economy notably asia have helped to increase exports supporting manufacturing though net exports are not likely to be a large net contributor to gdp growth overall 
the labor market remains very weak  as noted firms continue to look aggressively for cost savings and see little need to hire even if demand expands  small businesses which are normally a source of employment growth in recoveries have been hit especially hard by the credit crunch and weak demand ui claims are falling and job cuts are moderating but both are still high  the employmenttopopulation ratio is at a longterm low  firms will be able to increase hours to meet increases in demand delaying the need to add to payrolls  we must take account of the possibility of a jobless recovery 
financial markets have shown signs of healing with asset prices much higher than earlier this year and credit spreads much narrower  more recently though the markets have moved sideways reflecting uncertainty about recovery and continued improvement is not guaranteed  large firms with access to public markets are having little difficulty obtaining credit  they also hold plenty of cash  smaller bankdependent firms are having a more difficult time however  the situation for banks is mixed  rising nonperforming loans will be a continuing source of stress but there is some optimism about future credit losses and profits and liquidity are both improved  poorly rated banks in particular are not lending but are trying to improve their capital ratios by shedding assets and many participants cited commercial real estate as a major concern both for the banking system and for the broader economy  banks are also affected by policy uncertainty both here and abroad 
finally on inflation core inflation and median inflation are slowing but headline inflation will be increased somewhat by price increases in energy commodities and imports  wages and unit labor costs have slowed the latter reflecting sharp gains in productivity  firms report that they have no pricing power  participants continue to disagree on the appropriate weights to place on resource slack inflation expectations and other factors in forecasting inflation  substantial resource slack and slow wage growth may tend to push inflation down on the other hand inflation expectations may be less anchored and more disperse than they appear and could be vulnerable to the publics concerns about the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions that have been taken or to disorderly declines in the dollar 
participants discussed the measurement of market expectations of monetary policy the need to communicate exit plans and to exit at the appropriate time the need to allow asset purchases and other aspects of policy to respond on the margin to changes in economic outlook and the determinants of inflation expectations and potential output  thats my summary  comments reactions 
all right let me make just a few additional comments here  as everyone has noted the intermeeting data were modestly encouraging  we saw thirdquarter economic growth and we expect the fourth quarter to be positive as well  markets have become somewhat more uncertain though about the durability of the recovery and also perhaps about how this committee will proceed 
the issue remains for everyone i think what will happen after the end of this yearhow the recovery will look in 2010  at the last meeting i described my outlook as muddled and i remain firmly in that position laughter  if pressed however i would acknowledge that i feel somewhat more concerned about 2010 although i did make my balance of risks balanced  as many of you have noted the behavior of the consumer is very important and i guess the good news at least from a cyclical point of view is that the greenbook seems right so far that were not seeing a major increase in the household saving rate that would be at least in the short term a problem for the recovery 
however i do think there are some significant downside risks to that scenario particularly in the labor market and the banking sector and let me just talk about those a bit  as governor kohn mentioned the saving rate actually is quite low given many of the fundamentals and it seems very possible that it may rise if the labor market remains as weak as it appears  i would like to discuss the labor market briefly because i think we really need to focus on the labor market as one of the key elements of the recovery 
my sense is that even given the bad headline numbers in terms of unemployment and payrolls the labor market may be even weaker than it looks  for example insured unemployment on regular state programs the ui claims we check every thursday morning have peaked and come down significantly and the outstanding stock of people on unemployment insurance is down to about six million  but when you look at ui claims plus regular ui plus extended and emergency benefits the number is ten million and has not peaked  it is still very very high  recently the bls announced benchmark revisions that will lower the level of employment by another 850000 jobs  so joblessness employmenttopopulation ratios and so on are extraordinarily high  moreover that joblessness has a very large component of permanent separations and longterm unemployment  as weve seen in the last two recessionslooking at jolts data for examplehiring rates are particularly weak particularly contributing to the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment which is not encouraging as we look forward to the possibility of a jobless recovery 
just note that different demographic groups are reacting differently to the very poor state of the labor market  prime age males who have high attachment to the labor force have not dropped out of the labor force but their unemployment rate has jumped much more significantly than that for the labor force as a whole  on the other hand younger workers under age 24 have been dropping out of the labor force and participation rates there are considerably down  so my first general point is just that the weakness is perhaps even worse and more pervasive than the unemployment rate may suggest 
second looking forward theres not much indication of increased hiring at least in the medium term  you can see that in anecdotes we heard today  you can see that in surveys and i think there is the point that others have made but is worth mentioning again that despite all the cuts despite the cost savings firms have quite a bit of capacity to increase labor input without adding fulltime workers including calling back workers on furlough adding hours to parttime workers increasing work weeks and adding overtime and adding temporary workers which adds to the number of people employed but not obviously to longerterm employment 
a third point is that jobless recoveries almost by definition involve high productivity growth rates and all of the indications so far suggest that in fact employers are finding those cost savings which of course is good for the long term but again is a negative for future employment 
then the fourth and final point i want to make about the labor market is that we need to think about the interaction between the labor market and the credit markets  there is a tremendous contraction going on in bank lending  nominal ci bank loans outstanding are down about 12 percent or 200 billion over the past three quarters and although we have seen some improvement in the senior loan officer opinion survey we still have net tightening in that area  as people have noted for large firms the bank lending contraction may not be such a big problem  they have access to the public markets and they have lots of cash  but for small firms i think it is a serious problem as many of you have heard from your constituents  not only are bank lending and bank credit lines for small firms highly restricted but in addition you have the greatly reduced availability of home equity lines and credit card lines which are important for very small businesses as a source of credit  as a result of this the small business hiring plans as reported by the nfib are sharply below the troughs of 1990 and 2001 and have not improved at all from the worst levels of earlier this year 
now there is an ongoing debate on the importance of small business in job creation  there are some exaggerated numbers out there that are often used in political discourse  the net creation of jobs by small businesses is much less than the gross creation because of the rapid turnover of small firms but thats a steadystate observation  in the growth phase of the business cycle because small businesses are so cyclical they actually contribute substantially perhaps 40 percent or more to job additions during a recovery  so the credit problems that they face could be an important problem directly affecting employment 
let me just say a couple of words about the credit crunch and banks  i was encouraged to hear governor dukes views on banks  there are some encouraging signs in terms of profitability liquidity and credit quality  nevertheless as i mentioned before the actual lending the willingness to lend and loans outstanding are quite constrained and were seeing again very sharp declines in outstanding credit  an interesting question is whether or not the declines in credit in the banking sector are the normal response to a deep recession or whether there is something additional going on i may have remarked on this before but to try to test that weve done vector auto regression analysis that includes bank credit nominal gdp and terms and conditions of lending indicators from the sloos  and what you find interestingly is that the decline in lending can be explained by the combination of slow growth and tighter conditions  so in that respect it is normal but the tightening of conditions itself is far greater than would be expected historically given the decline in the economy  so what seems to be happening is that firms are making loans but they are doing so under unusually tight terms and conditions even conditional on the depth of the recession  now there are two possible explanations for that  one is that credit quality is worse than usual even given the state of the recession  the other is that banks own problems capital and so on are restricting credit in either case that is concerning and suggests that the financial headwinds will be there as we go forward 
again i do think that both the labor market and the credit markets are going to be very formidable issues going forward and make a moderatetoslow recovery more likely than a rapid recovery that being said i just want to say for the record that there are some upside risks to economic growth as well and theyre a little harder to identify almost by necessity since one never knows where growth is going to come from but these are important considerations 
i want to talk once more as i did last time a bit about implications of low interest rates  i think most would agree that there is a good policy case from the economys point of view for maintaining low rates but i think we also would all agree that we need to continue to monitor any possible side effects from low rate policies that might be concerning  one set of issues is speculative excesses and i will say that we are trying here at the boardand i hope you will at the reserve banks as wellto monitor even more closely than usual the state of asset prices as they evolve  my sense isand brian sack talked about this yesterdaythat us asset prices so far at least do not show any strong evidence of mispricing or asset bubbles  in particularly equity premiums are still above normal so stock prices dont seem unusually high bond spreads seem reasonable given expected default rates in the state of the economy and so on  so in the united states so farthough as i say we need to continue to monitor iti dont see that as being a nearterm concern although there is obviously a lot chatter about it and that is one reason i think we need to be particularly attentive   
there is more concern about what is happening in asia where some markets seem to be overheated  i just would make a point there which is that the link between those asset prices in asia and our monetary policy may be weaker than is sometimes believed  there is a view espoused in some quarters that because of the exchange rate management in asia federal reserve policies are essentially just imported into the asian economies and therefore are a source of overheating in those economies  a recent paper here at the board by erceg guerrieri and kamin looks at that from a number of different perspectives  one of the interesting points that they make is that if you look at the monetary policy indicatorsshortterm interest rates for examplein asian countries including china and compare them with the us federal funds rate you see quite a bit of divergence because of capital controls and because of imperfect substitutability among assets  asia does seem to have some ability to conduct independent monetary policy in that respect they obviously need to conduct policy thats appropriate for their region  in addition they have various kinds of quantitative controls on credit and on prices and they also have fiscal policy  so i think we need to pay attention to the asian situation but i would caution us not to overstate the responsibility of our policy for those excesses 
a second area that we need to pay attention to in terms of the side effects from the low interest rates is the behavior of the dollar  there were some anxious moments in the markets during the intermeeting period but if you look at the pattern of the dollar over the last year or so it seems to have been a fairly predictable and orderly evolution  what we have seen of course is a rise in the dollar associated with safe haven demand and then an unwinding of that safe haven demand as the financial markets have improved  indeed the current value of the dollar is about the same as it was before the crisis the same as in june 2007 and nominal and real broad indexes are either equal to or higher than what they were in 1995  so we see that there is not a really large secular movement in the dollar  moreover a lower dollar may be necessarywe dont know for sureto address the current account situation  the other relevant fact i think is that so far we dont see any evidence of a shift away from the dollar in reserve holdings  but all that said an orderly depreciation is orderly until its not orderly and then at that point there may be a change and we may be concerned  i think an unstable dollar does have costs both for us and for the international monetary system and obviously it also has implications for commodity prices inflation expectations and so on which could force our hand or hamper our policy in ways that we would otherwise not want to go  so again i think that this is an area that we need to continue to pay attention to 
ive talked about inflation before  im not going to reiterate  i think were all waiting for jeff fuhrer and the presentation in december to finally resolve all of the differences on the committee about the dynamics of inflation  laughter  so ill leave my views until that time 
i will just once again close by saying that one of the important elementsi think everyone agreesis to demonstrate that we can and will exit at the appropriate time from our extraordinary policies  the presentation yesterday about the progress being made on reverse repos and term deposits the winding down of our liquidity programs and so on shows that we are in fact more so than some other countries moving back toward a more normalized type of policy which i think when we are able to do that would be very good news  so let me stop there any questions or comments  president plosser   
mr plosser mr chairman on your discussion about credit and banks and the amount of loans outstandingmy understanding is that if we look at say ci loan outstanding credit there are two components to that  one is new loans being made and there are also the writedowns of existing loans that reduce what appears to be the outstanding value  so one of the things that i think would be interesting in looking at that is distinguishing between those two thingswhere the volume of new loans is how much of it is new loan creation and how much of it is just writedowns of existing loans and that might tell us some interesting things about whats happening 
chairman bernanke yes thats a very important point  i guess i would say that given that ci loans have fallen much more sharply than other categories it would seem unlikely that writedowns would be the major source of that  it is part of it certainly  but the other factor that affects those numbers is the ability of banks to make loans and then to securitize them  and that has actually declined which means that there is more holding of loans on their balance sheets  so that to some extent goes in the other direction but your point is well taken  other questions 
mr lacker mr chairman 
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker  the research you referenced vars and lending is that available  is that written up 
chairman bernanke well this was just a simple var that i asked for but certainly we can send it to you 
mr lacker give us a list of the variables well run it ourselves if we have to  if it was written up it would be really convenient 
chairman bernanke any other comments questions  all right  brian let me turn to you for introducing the policy round   
mr madigan3 footnote 3 the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3 end footnote 3   thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the package labeled material for briefing on monetary policy alternatives  this package includes the revised versions of the draft policy statements that were distributed on monday with one small further change to alternative b shown in blue and a correspondingly updated version of the sequence of policy statements and actions that was discussed in the bluebook 
as i noted yesterday the forecasts that you provided for this round indicate that most of you anticipate the economic recovery over the next several years to be protracted even more so than in the greenbook  the central tendencies of your projections of real gdp growth for 2010 2011 and 2012 are on the low side of the corresponding greenbook forecasts  as a result you generally see even slower progress than the staff in reducing unemployment over the next several years 12 of you see the unemployment rate remaining at or above 7 percent three years ahead above the forecast in the greenbook extension of 61 percent  although many of you edged up your estimate of the sustainable rate of unemployment nearly all of you estimate that rate to be no more than 5 percent suggesting that you see considerable slack persisting for years 
while some policymakers again noted in their forecast narratives that they view 
the linkage between slack and inflation as weak others anticipate that the 
underutilization of resources will put further downward pressure on inflation  in any case the central tendency of your inflation forecasts remains within a range of 1 to 2 percent over the next several years  most of you again indicated a view that with appropriate monetary policy inflation would be about 1 to 2 percent in the longer run thus most of you continue to expect that inflation over the next several years will be on the low side of what you see as the mandateconsistent rate of inflation 
the committee might see this combination of substantial persistent resource slack and very low inflation as motivation for adopting alternative a page 2 of your package at this meeting  under this alternative the committee would apply additional monetary policy stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities to 15 trillion and it would retain the existing maximum of 200 billion for its agency debt purchases in order to accomplish the increased mbs purchases and the substantial agency debt transactions without placing undue pressures on the associated markets these programs would be extended through the second quarter staff estimates suggest that the increase in mbs purchases might lower longerterm rates 15 to 30 basis pointsalthough admittedly these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty  such a decline in yields might provide sufficient stimulus to aggregate demand to reduce the unemployment rate two years ahead by as much as  percentage point relative to the rate that would otherwise prevail 
the committees statement would explain the decision to provide additional stimulus by noting that restraints on consumer spending and business spending suggest that the economic recovery will be relatively weak and that slack in resource utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy action and by highlighting that inflation has already fallen considerably over the past year  to make very clear that the committee did not anticipate raising rates at all for quite some time the statement would indicate that the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and continues to anticipate that low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended period 
if the committee instead saw its current policy stance as appropriately balancing the risks to growth and inflation and in particular as balancing the costs and benefits of largescale asset purchases it might be inclined toward adoption at this meeting of alternative b shown on page 3 even though policymakers generally anticipate a slow and protracted economic recovery appreciable and persistent resource slack and low inflation the committee might believe that continuing to stay its hand at this meeting is appropriate  according to your economic forecasts many of you no longer see the risks to economic growth as skewed significantly to the downside  and although you generally also see the risks to inflation as balanced many of you are still quite uncertain about the inflation outlook  even with an assessment that the risks to the inflation outlook are balanced at this stage you might see the potential costs of providing additional stimulusincluding possible adverse effects on inflation expectations and incrementally greater challenges in implementing an exit strategyas outweighing the potential benefits in terms of a reduction in economic slack and an inflation rate closer to your objective 
under alternative b you would leave the settings on your policy instruments essentially unchanged making no adjustments to your federal funds rate target range or your mbs purchase amounts and no major modifications to your forward guidance or agency debt purchases the first two paragraphs of the statement would largely repeat the language used in september  the statement would indicate that economic activity continues to pick up and that conditions in financial markets have been roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period  the committee would again mention that various factors are likely to continue to restrain household and business spending and that consequently economic activity would probably be weak for a time but the statement would still note that past policy actions and market forces are likely to support a strengthening of economic growth  in paragraph 2 the committee would once more note that resource slack and stable inflation expectations were likely to keep inflation subdued for some time 
the committee would continue to indicate in the third paragraph that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period however using new language the committee would specify that those economic conditions include low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations  by referring to economic conditions generally and by citing three factors that are included in the set of conditions the committee would make clear that these three factors would not necessarily be the sole triggers for changes in the committees policy stance  also by referring to subdued inflation trends this version would avoid implying that the committee would necessarily respond to shortterm changes in realized inflation rates which could be driven by factors such as transitory fluctuations in energy price inflation 
under alternative b the committee would indicate that it decided to purchase about 175 billion of agency debt securities somewhat less than the previously announced maximum of 200 billion  the committee might believe that it was unlikely to purchase the full 200 billion maximum amount after allowing for some tapering the desks current pace of purchases is consistent with total purchases of around 175 billion between now and the end of the first quarter of next year  relative to the language circulated on monday we suggested a small additional revision to help clarify that this was the committees motivation for making the change although market participants generally do not anticipate that the committee will alter its plans for agency debt purchases the contemplated adjustment is small  moreover the overall announcement appears to be broadly in line with market expectations and thus seems unlikely to prompt a sizable market reaction 
under alternative c page 4 the committee would reduce the degree of monetary accommodation by scaling back its largescale asset purchases at this meeting  the committee might be inclined to adopt this alternative if it saw the recovery as now reasonably well established and was not especially concerned that slack might push inflation to excessively low levels the committee might also be motivated to adopt this approach if were concerned that it might have difficulty reversing its accommodative policy stance at the appropriate time or possibly if it were worried that very substantial amounts of liquidity in the financial system might already be in the process of causing significant distortions in asset prices 
in the first paragraph of the announcement for alternative c the committee would indicate that an economic recovery appears to be under way  the statement would note that household spending appears to be expanding without citing the list of possible restraints that are referenced in alternative b and would mention that businesses appear to have made additional progress in bringing inventories into better alignment with sales  the second paragraph would express the expectation that with appropriate monetary policy adjustments inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability thereby acknowledging an active role for policymakers in influencing the inflation outlook in the third paragraph the committee would note that it anticipates maintaining low rather than exceptionally low levels of the funds rate and for some time rather than for an extended period  clearly these two changes would be read by market participants as suggesting that the committee was beginning to think seriously about raising shortterm interest rates  the committee would back up those changes in words with actionreductions in its largescale asset purchases to 11 trillion of mbs and 160 billion of agency debt  it would also indicate an intention to complete those purchases by january rather than march these changes would directly reduce support for those asset classes and their close substitutes and it would also significantly reduce the accumulation of reserves in the banking system relative to that of alternative b  with market participants not anticipating any significant change in policy settings at this meeting the combination of the change in wording and the reduction in asset purchases under this alternative would likely trigger an appreciable backup in market interest rates 
the bluebook also provided for your consideration an illustrative sequence of policy language and actions going forward that sequence modified slightly to reflect the changes we have made to the draft policy alternatives is included on the next couple of pages of the package key portions of the policy alternatives for todays meeting are shown in step 2 depending on how conditions unfold language similar to that in step 2 for either alternative a or alternative b could be repeated for several meetings  if the committee were to adopt alternative a or alternative b today at some future meeting once the economic recovery is viewed as sufficiently established the committee might consider modifying its guidance to refer to the maintenance of either low or exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate and for some time rather than for an extended period as in step 3  if the committee instead selects alternative c at this meeting it would have already adopted the for some time language proposed for step 3   
once the situation has progressed to the point that the committee has concluded that policy firming would soon be appropriate it might consider a number of changes to its policy language and forward guidance  for example as shown in step 4 the committee might want to indicate that some or a gradual reduction in the exceptionally large degree of monetary accommodation will be appropriate before long the following sentence could note that such tightening would be conditioned on economic and financial circumstances but still provide somewhat more specificity about the committees sense of when that reduction might be initiatedfor example by narrowing it down to a halfyear interval  the remainder of the paragraph would discuss the tools that the federal reserve anticipated using to accomplish this reduction including increases in the rate of interest on reserves reverse repos and term deposits for banks  it could also indicate that although the federal reserve currently does not have plans to sell assets from its portfolio it retains the option of such sales 
an example of the language that could accompany a decision to commence policy firming is shown as the fifth step  here we have assumed that the committee retains a target range for the federal funds rate at least initially  we have further assumed that the discount rate and the interest rate on reserves would be raised commensurately with the increase in the federal funds rate target  in the example the committee would direct the desk to use reverse repos to reduce the quantity of excess reserves in the banking system to reinforce the upward pressure on shortterm interest rates however it is also possible that the committee might decide to drain reserves from the banking system before it raised its target range for the federal funds rate the committee could indicate its intention to further or gradually reduce the stillexceptional degree of monetary accommodation in subsequent months  the statement could again indicate the tools that might be employed to execute this reduction and reiterate that asset sales could also be employed 
of course the committees exit strategy potentially has many moving parts and at this stage the exact combination and sequence in which these tools would be used is not entirely clear thus we emphasized in the bluebook that these drafts should be viewed only as illustrative nonetheless they might be helpful to the committee in considering how its nearterm policy decisions might fit into a broader plan for ultimately removing policy accommodation  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you brian i have actually a quick question  in the final part of the exit you have a federal funds rate target which changes and then you support that with an increase in interest rate on reserves and so on  are we comfortable with that the alternative would be say to tighten monetary conditionsthe federal reserve is taking the following actionsand those would include the interest rate on reserves sterilization of some  reserves and so on you dont have to answer the question now exactly but it seems to me that an alternative rather than targeting the federal funds rate might be simply to state the actions that we would be taking which we know we can control and therefore reduce that slippage 
mr madigan yes that certainly seems as though it is worth further thought and discussion and i dont have a definite answer for you at this point  one disadvantage of proceeding in that direction might be that market participants would wonder what happened to the target funds rate range and why the committee didnt set one  and it would seem that we would need to explain why we didnt set one 
chairman bernanke other questions  president lockhart 
mr lockhart brian in your discussion of alternative b and the new language that precedes the extended period statement if i heard you correctly you were saying that you were proposing to add the new language but it is not necessarily the sole trigger and that that is conveyed in the statement  is that conveyed by the word including 
mr madigan yes president lockhart that was our thoughtthat by referencing primarily economic conditions and then including a subordinate set of phrases these specific items those would not be necessarily the only factors that could lead to a change in the target range 
mr lockhart and it is your sense that adding this new language which is a lot more specific as to conditionality is balanced with the including word and others to convey that it is not necessarily those factors that are going to dictate our decision 
mr madigan that was our thought 
chairman bernanke president plosser 
mr plosser just in thinking about this transition one of the things that would be interesting to know isand mr chairman you talked a bit about this yesterdaywhere do you want to get to at the end of the day in terms of how we are going to conduct policy are we going to envision ourselves in a corridor system of some kind or a floor system how are we going to treat the federal funds market  getting more specific about where that endpoint is where we think we want to get to as we come to more normal policy would be helpful to us and then working backwards to figure out the transition we want to get there  i think this is a really good exercise for us to be doing and so i would encourage you to keep pursuing that and thinking about that endpoint would be a useful addition to thinking about that 
mr madigan and we do continue that work 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans thank you its a small question  i am probably parsing this too closely but the words that you gave usin alternative a you refer to this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended period and in b exceptionally low levels    for an extended period my inference on this would be that b accepts the possibility that this might be a higher funds rate than 0 to  since it is not this exceptionally low i wouldnt have interpreted b that way butam i parsing too much 
mr madigan well that was the distinction  alternative a just pins it down more tightly than b does but it may not be an important 
mr evans i would guess that the committees interpretation of b is this 0 to  range for an exceptional period of time  okay thanks 
mr kohn and that repeats the language of the september 
mr evans yes it does it is something only we would recognize as a difference because we see a and b laughter 
mr fisher brian accented this 
mr evans well its in red 
chairman bernanke he used the language  i assure you that someone will notice it president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  this has to do with your interpretation of the including word the original version last week was that we continue to anticipate that these three things are likely to warrant low levels for an extended period  i interpreted that as a oneway thing and as that we are not going to raise rates unless one of these three things changes  so there are two things first i take low rates of resource utilization to be a broad reference to the level of economic activity  then there is inflation  i am wondering what else there is that is relevant to policy and then i have another question 
mr madigan well just as an example and this may or may not be a good example the value of the dollar was mentioned earlier as a possible consideration in making monetary policy the revised language was intended just to loosen things up a bit so that it was not solely these three factors that would necessarily drive policy decisions 
mr lacker the second question is the original way in which i read this is that we are not going to raise rates unless one of these three things changes is that the way you interpreted the original 
mr madigan well it is not an absolute commitment  it is an expectation but apart from that distinctionyes 
chairman bernanke this is the bellman principle president lacker  the bellman principle is that if the situation looks the same you do the same  right if the economy looks six months from now exactly as it looks today 
mr lacker yes i understand that but now there is a fourth thing that we are not telling them about which could induce us to change rates even if these other three things 
mr fisher are you talking about the dollar 
mr lacker whatever it is 
mr fisher oh the unknown fourth thing 
mr lacker we are saying that we are not going to change rates unless one of these three things changes or a fourth secret thing changes  is that the right way to interpret this 
mr madigan well i dont certainly see it as referencing a secret  clearly these three factors that we list explicitly are very important factors in governing the stance in policy  but again this is simply intended to allow for the possibility that something else might incline the committee to adjust its policy even without a significant change in these three items 
chairman bernanke i think it conveys a sense also of not being an automatic mechanical triggerthat there is still going to be judgment involved in looking at all of these issues 
mr lacker but it is one way right  it says that we are not going to do it unless one of these three things changes but if one of these three changes we dont have to do it the way it was worded before so it doesnt require us to do it if one of these changes  it just means one of those things has to change before we do it right  thats the way i was interpreting it 
chairman bernanke i dont think it actually means that  remember what we said originally we made a forecast of policy that we said economic conditions would likely justify it wasnt an unconditional forecast  it was a conditional forecast that we thought the economy was going to evolve in such a way that would justify low rates of interest and this is a description of some of the things that we would be looking at that we expect to happen and that would therefore tend to keep us at the low rate 
mr lacker i guess what im saying is that the way it was before and the way it was done if conditions are in this set rates will be low 
vice chairman dudley  likely 
mr lacker and if they are out of this set all bets are off  were not saying whether they are going to be low or not  
chairman bernanke we can go back to the old language if you want but the purpose of it is to try to provide more explicit information about what we are going to be looking at 
mr lacker exactly i endorse that entirely 
chairman bernanke and i think the presumption would be if there were a sharp change in inflation expectations for example that we would respond to it 
mr lacker absolutely yes i think it is valuable to provide some more guidance like this and to round out the reaction function  but my interpretation is that we are just saying that in this set of conditions we expect low rates  it is sort of asymmetric in that regard   
chairman bernanke i think it would be read as saying that if these conditions fail to hold we would have to respond to it or at least seriously consider responding to it 
mr lacker all right 
chairman bernanke other questions for brian  president pianalto  
ms pianalto mr chairman when the first draft of alternative b came out it dropped economic conditions and just listed these three factors and i commented to brian that i thought that was just too narrow because it was so closely focused on these three factors  so i prefer this revised language because it leaves in economic conditions and then as you point out highlights these three factors  i just wanted to highlight that it was a concern that i had raised  i prefer the language as it is now 
chairman bernanke any other questions for brian okay the coffee is ready and in order not to interrupt the policy goround why dont we take a break and restart at 1100  thank you 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke okay why dont we recommence with the policy goround president plosser leadoff hitter 
mr plosser all right thank you mr chairman  while the timing of our exit from this period of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation remains highly uncertain i do think it is important for the committee to begin to consider language that begins to prepare the markets for that eventuality never being shy about being a maverick i think that we should begin that process sooner rather than later thus i have a general preference for the language in alternative c although even in c i would not choose at this point to cut mbs purchases from 125 trillion to 11 trillion just at our last meeting we took out up to and therefore committed to 125 trillion i dont think cutting it would be a good idea  it would confuse the market at this point however for some strange reason i get the impression that the committee is not yet ready to adopt alternative c laughter maybe one of the more understated statements i have made but i certainly get that impression   
but i do think there are some elements of c that could be useful incorporating into alternative b to help prepare markets for a shift in policy stance at some point  so i would like to suggest a couple of those in particular  i think the emphasis in paragraph 2 of c on stable inflation expectationsand particularly i like the language on policy adjustments that will keep inflation at levels consistent with price stabilityis good language  from my perspective this indicates a more proactive approach to price stability which i think is appropriate  thus i would prefer to substitute paragraph 2 of c for paragraph 2 of b  now an intermediate step for that might be to leave paragraph 2 in b as is and substitute inflation will remain subdued in the near term for inflation will remain subdued for some time  then include a sentence in b adopting from c with appropriate policy adjustments the committee expects inflation to remain at levels consistent with price stability reinforcing our efforts to say that we will clearly deliver on this 
the other modification i would make to alternative b is in the forward guidance for the funds rate in paragraph 3 obviously i would have preferred that we move away from an extended period and substitute some time  i think this is a signal that the policy environment is in fact changing we have kept rates near zero now for almost a year and the extended period language has been in place since march i think we are closer in time whenever that time may be to raising rates today than we were in march and now might be a useful time to indicate as much 
in fact even if we were to raise rates to 50 basis points or to 75 basis points they would still be extraordinarily low by any historical standard  indeed there may be some real advantage to moving policy modestly away from the zero bound to allow these shortterm financial markets and money markets to begin operating more normally in a more normal environment  i would suggest that we need to consider the fact that our extensive intervention in some of these markets may be an inhibitor to the financial and economic recovery that we all desire  in any event changing the language in this manner is not inconsistent with other actions we have taken to gradually unwind our extraordinary actions for example we have ended the treasury purchase program  we are limiting taf auctions  we are prepared to cap purchases at less than the full amount of agency debt in the statement  and we have suggested the termination of some other liquidity programs  the markets now know that we will gradually remove accommodation so i dont see that a shift in terms of this language would be either dramatic or disruptive  yes probably the timing of the language change may come as a surprise and there may be some immediate market reaction  i dont think this should deter us since i also think there are costs to waiting too long to at least signal that we are contemplating a more direct exit   
with respect to the new language in alternative b paragraph 3 i prefer the revision to what was in the bluebook although i am a little uncomfortable with some of the ambiguity  by being explicit about resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations as among the joint determinants of monetary policywhich i think is what the language is trying to dowe seem to be preparing the markets for the possibility that monetary policy would react to unwelcome inflationary developments even if resource utilization is lower than we would like i think that is a good thing  we ought to be doing that and i am supportive of being more explicit about the nature of our reaction function and the factors that matter  i think that is important for transparency and communication 
on the other hand of course my view about yet another repetition of resource utilization language is that this reinforces my concern about our narrative that i talked about yesterday that our narrative about resource utilization is something i am uncomfortable with and it may unduly tie our hands if we are not careful nevertheless even with that i am in favor of the language change but i do not want and i dont think we should prefer to take steps that explicitly or implicitly are designed to lower the expected future funds rate path  in fact i think it would serve us well if the statement raised the path somewhat 
i agree with president bullard that this committee has historically not begun a tightening cycle until often two years or more after the trough  however while that may be true about our behavior i dont infer from that that such behavior is in any way optimal or desirable and so i wouldnt want to take that forecast as meaning that we shouldnt do anything for the next two years that shouldnt govern our response 
one part of the language that i am a little uncomfortable about is that i find the use of the phrase subdued inflation trends somewhat ambiguous and thus kind of lacking content and transparency how is the market supposed to know what we think the inflation trend is if we cant define it for ourselves  if what we mean is core inflation then we ought to say so  what we seem to want to be signaling as brian indicated is that we may not be worried or we wont worry about reacting to rising commodity prices and oil prices  at the same time if we dont want to react to thosei dont recall us going to such pains to make such a distinction when oil prices plummeted from 150 a barrel to 70 a barrel last fall and winter and then we reacted to that with fears of deflation so i think a model of the deflation that we have witnessed over the past year particularly in headline and to some degree in core is partly a passthrough reflection of oil prices falling just as we get some upside when oil prices rose  we werent very explicit about the nature of relative price movements during that period and so we seem to be asymmetric in our reaction function and i dont think we should be 
once again i think we find ourselves in somewhat of a language box which could be greatly mitigated by having an explicit wellarticulated inflation target  what we really should worry about is the impact of these relative price shifts on expectations of inflation and having an inflation target specified over a reasonable period would allow us to focus on headline inflation and give us much less angst in wordsmithing challenges and explaining what we mean 
i will simply note that i am also comfortable with reducing the volume to 175 billion of the agency debt the desk has warned us a couple of times about fears and concerns they may have about our dominating that market and the functioning of that agency debt market  so i think it is appropriate that we try to exit ourselves from that as soon as possible 
finally i would like to commend the staff for including the section on a possible sequence of language and actions in the most recent bluebook  i think this is a great step in the right direction  it is important that we begin thinking ahead about how we will exit and the language that would help us do that  as i mentioned before it would be nice if we could define for ourselves what the new operating regime will be in normal times and then work backwards in our language so that we get to the place where we want to be  but i found this a step in the right direction  this is a useful exercise and i hope we will continue it   
i have a couple of comments one in paragraph 4 of table 2 in the bluebookpolicy firming is likely soon i guess is the titlei think this may be too small a step  actually i think the first step we might consider taking at some time might be a step to eliminate the range from 0 to  percent for our fed funds rate that maybe we just ought to set it at  percent as a first step i think we can do this it wouldnt be effectively raising effective rates very much  it would send an important signal and it would give us some experience in operating under a true intereston reserves regime in figuring out how close we could come to actually hitting our target with ior so i think that maybe could be a useful first step at some point in the nottoodistant future and then depending on how that works we can go from there as we move forward the other thing is that i do not favor establishing calendar dates to describe our policy path policy is statecontingent where states are economic conditions not necessarily datedependent and i think we need to avoid that if we can  we must continue to stress that distinction and work better and harder to articulate the nature of the relevant states that we will react to which is why i favor the new language in alternative b 
another possibility that does not seem included in table 2 but is discussed in the bluebook and i think deserves more discussion is the option for us to begin soaking up some of the excess reserves from the banking system before we make an explicit decision to raise rates  a modest program of selling assets earlier rather than later might support the effectiveness of interestonreserves mechanisms and our ability to hit the target  it would also lead to a smaller monetary base on which to implement some of our reservemanagement tools and maybe even negate the need for them as we go forward thus i would urge us to develop this option more fully and think along the lines of eliminating the range for the federal funds rate   
as a footnote i would remind the committee that last time we had a discussion about the supplementary financing program with the treasury  over the last two months if i read the numbers correctly something like 150 billion has been added to excess reserves simply because of the treasurys termination of that program  i think we need to be explicit about what we are doing with that program and how it is affecting excess reserves  the policy discussion seems to indicate there is some assumption that it is going to come back to 200 billion next year  i dont know whether it will or not  it certainly might  but if it doesnt come back the treasury is conducting quantitative easing on behalf of us  and i think we need to explicitly address that concern and make some explicit choices about whether we want that sterilized or not and i think that is going to be an important step going forward 
finally the last topicparagraph 5 of table 2 in the bluebook i thinkis on the discount rate decision and we talked a little about this last time  we are going to need to address the issue of the appropriate spread between primary credit rates and the fed funds rate or the term deposit rate do we want the penalty rate to come back if so by how much and when and how does that interact with our decisions on raising rates  ifand this is a big ifwe have effectively driven stigma from the system in part through the crisis and by the taf i dont think we want to have stigma return if we can help it because we would like the discount window to operate more effectively  so that may affect how we think about the penalty rate  it would certainly affect how our credit officers in our individual banks react when they pick up the phone to call a bank and say you have been at the discount window for a week now  what is going on  that is something that many of our credit officers do  it is prudence but it contributes to solidifying the stigma process which i think we would like to get rid of  in any event i would encourage the staff to continue working on these important aspects of our transition and the future of the discount window i appreciate their efforts  thank you very much 
chairman bernanke thank you president plosser just a couple of factual matters  i think we do anticipate that the treasury will raise its balances again  but if they dont well have to address that  second i think a lot of people around the table agree with you about inflation targets but if they are to be credible and democratically legitimate they need to have at least some political support  and i think this moment is probably not the optimal point  okay president rosengren 
mr plosser i just keep making my plugs  thats all laughter 
chairman bernanke i understand 
mr rosengren thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b and the language we are seeing some initial signs of recovery but that recovery is likely to be weak and subject to reversal  given that we make little progress on reaching full employment or 2 percent core pce inflation over the forecast period even with the funds rate pinned at zero i am strongly in favor of retaining the extended period language  given the significantly greater losses that would be associated with the realization of downside versus upside risks to my growth outlook i hope we retain some policy flexibility over the coming months  i can easily conceive of conditions under which we would need to provide additional stimulus to the economy 
two additional comments  first while i am comfortable with the language that has been added surrounding the agency purchase program i would say i still am concerned that some will view that as a policy change so to the extent that we can possibly use informal mechanisms to reiterate that it is not a policy change i think that would be advisable  second in terms of communicating policy as we do start shifting to changes i think we should focus on things that we know we can influence  so interest on reserves would be where i would be focusing the statements at least initially until we get a better sense of how that works  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker 
mr lacker thank you mr chairman  at this time i dont think it is warranted to increase interest rates so i am in favor of alternative b with some comments on the language that i want to focus on first let me say with regard to the agency debt language it is still 175 billion too high in my view but it is a step in the right direction  i would support that change i share president plossers eagerness to move to the some time language but right now i think it is probably too soon with all due respect to make that move  so i am happy leaving the extended period language in there  i strongly support adding the list of economic conditions to spell out to some extent the nature of our reaction function  i think that is a good idea i think that is way better than treating markets to an extended period of altered adjectives on our way to our first increase 
my comments have to do with just wanting to tighten up how we all understand that and how we communicate that new language so as i said earlierand i did a very imprecise job of explaining thisthe way i view the little grammatical construction of the sentence is that our forecast is if these three conditions are all true then interest rates will be low  now in my view that doesnt say anything about the states of the world in the future in which one of those is false  so i dont view it as strictly speaking tying our hands to move if one of those conditions is violated so i think it is a minimal nice sort of judicious conveyance of the things we are going to be focusing on and that are important what they can count on with regard to keeping interest rates low and what might trigger but wouldnt necessarily trigger an increase  so i dont think it ties our hands too much  i know that is always a broad concern  from that point of view i am a little uncomfortable with the including language  maybe we wont keep secret these other conditions which is not to put them in the statement but its hard to think of another condition that we care about that wouldnt have an effect or be expected to have an effect on these three thingsinflation and rates of resource utilization which i take to be a reference broadly to economic activity  so the value of the dollar for example is going to have an effect on economic activity  fiscal policy potentially is something you might point to but there again that would imply a change in economic activity absent our reaction  so i dont view this as useful and it waters down the conditionality because remember it would make the statement that there are more than three things that have to be true and we are going to tell you three of them under which interest rates will always be low  but there are some others we are not going to tell you about so i think it would be clear if we dropped the including and went back to the original thing 
the main concern i have about the language is the phrase low rates of resource utilization now let me make clear that unlike president plosser i dont object to the use of the phrase resource utilization here because this is not in the context of an inflation forecast  i think it is quite logical to benchmark our description of the level of economic activity in terms of some normative or longrun averages or sorts of norms the way president kocherlakota did  so i am comfortable with it in this context  my concern is that low is a very imprecise term and could be interpreted more broadly than i think we have in mind  and to my mind it has this whiff of association with policy under the sort of stopgo era of policy when we waited until we got back to something like full employment or thought of ourselves as waiting until the unemployment rate was all the way back again to normal before we raised rates  and i dont think we want to be that liberal  i dont think we want to cast that wide a net around the conditions under which we are going to keep rates low  so i would be more comfortable with a tighter characterization 
now this also made me think of president bullards memo in which he argued that the range of uncertainty about the level of the output gap is an argument for working in terms of first differences rather than levels of gaps and that would suggest some sort of firstdifference language here unfortunately the best i could come up with was nonincreasing rates of resource utilization that struck me as so clunky and so obscure as to not really be a serious contender as a substitute for that some tighter characterization of low would be usefullike very low laughter i thought about stagnant moribund depressed and went through the thesaurus function of microsoft word pretty thoroughly  but very low is about the best i could come up with  i think that it would be useful to constrain the amount of information we are conveying a bit in a way that i think is consistent withi mean lets be honest herewe are looking forward to a period in which i think we all recognize that we bring to this table some very different predilections about sooner rather than later later rather than sooner  and well wrestle with those issues when the time comes  in this statement lets just look for a consensus across both camps  lets just look for something that we can all sign onto here  its in that spirit that i think very low is preferable to me to just low rates of resource utilizationas hopelessly finagling as that sounds 
so let me comment a bit about asset sales because this came up yesterday  first of all i want to commend the bluebook which sketched out what the steps might look like  i think it is a very good thing for us to think about devoting some time to really discussing and analyzing that i am going to have some suggestions for staff analysis that in the future might help us work through that but my presumption would have been that we would view asset sales as our first choice rather than our last choice  so i would like to see some discussion and analysis of that going forward 
i appreciate the value of additional tools  i dont object to our building them and having them in place  but there are essentially two reasons that i think we ought to think about asset sales first one is that it is not obvious the extent to which reverse rps and term deposits are going to be as effective at altering monetary conditions as asset sales  we talked yesterday about the extent to which reverse rps or term deposits are nonmonetary  obviously just that little cost makes them to some extent nonmonetary  but that cost which could be kind of small in some contexts is a measure of how close they are to being virtually a perfect substitute  moreover with reserve balances as high as they are surely some banks view it as extremely likely that four weeks from now they are going to want as much reserves as they have now  if that is true then a bunch of the reserve holdings are in some sense inframarginal and for them to convert those to term deposits may not have any effect on their desire to shift funds out of excess reserve balance holdings so there is some uncertainty to my mind  i think there is a good chance that they will succeed but also a good chance that they will just be viewed as a perfect substitute for overnight reserves and wont have much of an effect 
second of all just asset sales in generalyesterday we heard evidence from the manager that our purchases have driven down mbs rates by much more than they drove down treasury rates remember earlier in the year we had this sequence  in december we got these predictions from the staff that the effects of treasury purchases versus mbs purchases were different in amount  then a couple of meetings later there was sort of an aboutface and it was a parallel shift they thought that they would have the same effect under the idea that there is a good arbitrage between the two now it seems as though the evidence over this year of experience is that we have driven down mbs rates more than we have driven down treasury rates those spreads were described as abnormally low which suggests to some extent relative to some longrun norm that we are distorting markets now  as we exit from what we are doing now we ought to be thinking about where we want to go and i think we want to go to a world where we are not having this permanently expansionary effect from depressing mbs rates  
i will just mention as well the hypothesisand i havent seen any evidence against this that by buying mbs we are implicitly withdrawing credit from some other sector of the economy  i mean it is bound to be true  so whether it is net stimulative is completely uncertain  it is not at all clear that this is stimulative on net for the economy to drive down mbs rates rather than treasury rates 
so on a lot of grounds i would like to see us transition to being out of the housing finance business a couple of years from now and there are abundant political economy reasons to do that as well i recognize that asset sales even announcing them might have a dramatic price effect  but the minute we raise the interest rate on excess reserves we are going to have a yield curve effect  there is going to be a selloff of treasuries  they are going to know that this is it  here it comesa sequence of tightening moves  so i dont think that should dissuade usthat it might be an outsized move   
those are the broad reasons i think that asset sales deserve equal time on our agenda and some serious analysis as instruments as we move forward  thank you very much mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president lacker  president yellen 
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b  with the funds rate effectively constrained at zero and our largescale assetpurchase programs nearing completion communication relating to the future path of policy is the main tool now available to shape market expectations influence longerterm interest rates and thereby affect the overall degree of monetary accommodation  for this reason i think its important that we clearly communicate our goals and policy strategy and i very much like alternative bs clear portrayal of the key factors that will guide our future policy decisions consistent with our own past behaviornamely resource utilization inflation trends and inflation expectations  thats not to rule out the possibility that some other factors could play a role but these have been the prime drivers in the past and i think should and will be the prime drivers going forward  it is because i expect resource utilizationnamely unemploymentto remain far above the nairu for a long time for core inflation to be below my preferred 2 percent objective and inflation expectations to remain anchored that my own policy expectations accord with the assumptions in the greenbook and the constrained optimal policy path in the bluebook  of course we are in waitandsee mode now  but at this critical juncture we need to be very careful not to add to market confusion about what the main determinants will be of policy going forward and i fear that if we are confusing we may hinder recovery and the attainment of price stability 
i was pleased to see the additional language relating to our decision on agency debt in the revised version of b  i think its very important to avoid leaving market participants with the impression that our decision not to go up to the maximum of 200 billion reflects a shift in our intended monetary policy path  and i would support president rosengrens suggestion that if there is an informal way to convey to market participants that this was a technical decision rather than a policy decision doing so would be useful 
on the issue of asset sales i also agree with presidents bullard and lacker that we should consider using asset sales as part of an exit strategy especially if we think that the market for mbs is beginning to normalize and function more effectively  i think as we taper down our purchases over the next couple of months were going to get a much better sense of that  but if thats a properly functioning market i also think it may make sense to begin to actually sell assets when this is a long way offwe finally exit  i would not necessarily assume that were only going to let those run off our portfolio rather than sell them 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor kohn 
mr kohn thank you mr chairman  i favor the language of alternative b  i agree with president plosser that the passage of time and the confirmation of the upturn in the economy brings exit closer but the outcomes are still quite unsatisfactory through 2012 certainly by my forecast  and looking at the central tendency of the committees forecast as brian pointed out in 2012 we still have resource utilization a couple of percentage points below where we think it should be over the longer run and inflation below where we think it should end up  so being constrained at the lower bound were not in any way at an optimal setting and i think it will be quite a while before we tighten  i had my tightening in mid2011  i think president plosser and president lacker have raised interesting points about how to structure the exit and what to do and so we have all next year to discuss it  laughter  doesnt that sound like fun 
paragraphs 1 and 2 to me present the right picture which is that not much has changed since the last meeting and thats the consensus here  so im happy with that language  obviously with my policy expectations i feel very strongly that we ought to retain the extended period language 
with regard to the three factors in here i think thats a good idea  those factors are related to our mandate and to my mind levels are very important not only because of the legislative mandate but also because they make sense in my economic model  adding those factors underlines that its a conditional forecast that talks about the economic conditions and it gives us some elements to talk about as we edge closer to exit whenever that might be  i like that the words anticipate and then are likely to give a certain forwardlooking aspect to it and thats right  we should be thinking about what those factors are going to be in four or eight quarters not necessarily what they are today  i think that president lacker is right  the including language suggests that something else might be out there  it gives us some flexibility  to my mind these issues about the dollar and asset prices would play primarily through these three factors that we have here and wouldnt have an independent role in monetary policy but the way it is worded gives us a little flexibility in that regard  and i could live with president lackers suggestion about putting very in front of low rates of resource utilization  after all were justifying exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate 
i agree with specifying the 175 billion  thats the path were on  why not reduce uncertainty as long as were clear about the fact that its because of the market functioning that were doing this and were not really pulling back policy  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president bullard 
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  id like to focus my remarks on a suggested handling of the assetpurchase program going forward versus exclusive focus on interest rate movements as the next important policy choice for this committee  i have been disappointed by an overemphasis on interest rates in the markets versus discussion of the quantitative easing program  i think that this reflects a hangover from a long period of time 25 years or longer when interest rate movements defined what this committee was doing with regard to monetary policy and that markets have not really fully adjusted to the fact that we have other tools in place that we can adjust to try to implement a stabilization policy  then at the end ill turn to a few comments on issues about the statement and alternative b 
a broad description of monetary policy over the last year to my mind would go like this  in december 2008 almost one year ago we adopted our nearzero interest rate policy  in january 2009 we naturally switched to a quantitative easing program focused primarily on agency mbs which if im not mistaken the chairman has described as relatively standard now around the world for many central banks  and in march 2009 we made a dramatic expansion of that commitment which were still living up to and which will not be completed until the first quarter of 2010  the quantitative easing program has been considered successful and we saw some estimates yesterday  i think we all understand that theres a lot of uncertainty around those estimates nevertheless i think it is generally considered to have been an effective program 
when i talk about monetary policy i try to exclude liquidity programs that i regard as lenderoflast resort responses to the crisis such as swaps the taf and commercial paper  all those facilities that are now running down they reached a peak of almost 15 trillion but now are all winding down so i consider those separately and i consider the assetpurchase program to be the hallmark of our quantitative easing program  this description suggests a certain logic believe it or not to current policy which is to pursue interest rate targeting in normal times and to switch to quantitative easing if the zero bound is encountered  and that suggests that the tightening sequence should go the other way  gradually remove the quantitative easing and then raise rates later as appropriate given the information that comes in on the economy 
now i think one of the key problems from the point of view of the way the committee is thinking right now is that we do not currently view our quantitative easing program in feedback rule form there is some talk about it but we dont really think in terms of adjusting the quantitative easing program one way or another in response to incoming data  we more or less have the idea that were going to go to our limit that we set in march of last year and then were going to stay there and let it run off the balance sheet  i do not think that that is an optimal policy  we should begin to adjust that program going forward in 2010 and in particular possibly sell some mbs as the first indication of a tightening move 
so what are the advantages of proceeding in this direction i see this as a softer way to tighten policy than making a funds rate move or even than changing the extended period language as described in the extra section in the bluebook this time  if we make any moves on the funds rate target or really interest on reservesa phrase that used to be used around here was ringing the gongwere really making a loud statement that were now embarked on a tightening program  people will immediately extrapolate a whole sequence of moves and that will be a big event when it occurs maybe its a long way away as governor kohn just said but that would be a big move  so if we did it this other way which says okay were going to gradually sell off some of the mbs that would be softer  thats one point   
i also think it allows some optionality during our current period of nearzero interest rates  we can adjust the quantitative easing program in response to incoming information possibly very possibly the news will not be good and we might need to adjust in an upward direction  several people here have remarked about all the uncertainty  i think we all have to keep in mind that theres just a giant amount of uncertainty around any forecast  it could come in very badly next year or it could come in very positively  we dont know  there are a lot of possibilities out there 
let me say i agree with president yeltsinyeltsin  laughter  you told that story and i was going to avoid that  i agree with president yellen that we should defend our inflation target on the low side as well as on the high side  just because the history of the last 25 years was all about ratcheting down inflation thats not really the environment that we are in today  inflation is very low and maybe threatens to go lower and we have to keep that in mind and be aggressive and attentive on that 
also what im suggesting would take some of the unusual assets off our balance sheet and i think that that would be helpful  this institution has not normally held assets like this in the past  it would be better for the institution and better for fed independence to get out of the business if we could and if we could do it in a way that would support recovery going forward and would also mitigate interest rate risk problems that may accrue later as rates rise  of course we could also combine asset sales or any kind of asset adjustments with a higher funds rate if that became necessary  so that would also be on the table  in particular if the news came in particularly strong over the next year to 18 months wed still have that option on the table 
so i want to think of the quantitative easing program in terms of fed funds rate equivalence  when the zero bound is encountered then you switch to the quantitative policy which has according to our estimates some stimulative impact  you can think about some kind of mapping that translates that across toif you could lower the fed funds rate further how much impact would that have thats what youre getting out of the quantitative easing program and thats how you should think about it then we would be gradually reducing that accommodation going forward  
for today i favor alternative b  i dont have a lot of comments about the text itself but i do think as a general comment that we tend to overemphasize arguments concerning resource slack  im not saying that we should put zero emphasis on them but i think we overemphasize them as causal for inflation  i know that were going to discuss these issues in more detail at the december meeting and i think we should just wait until then to get further into those comments  i like one aspect of alternative c that president plosser mentioned which is paragraph 2  it more accurately reflects that we think inflation is going to stay close to target because we think were going to take the actions that are going to keep inflation close to target  instead of leaving us subject to the whims of how the economy is developing going forward that would better reflect the situation with respect to inflation  so i like that aspect  i dont expect us to adopt it today but thats something to think about going forward  so thanks very much   
chairman bernanke thank you  president hoenig 
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  like a couple of others i would have some preference for alternative c but this is not the day and i recognize that  the reason i have some preference is that i do worry about this environment in which we are at such low rates and we are purchasing assets and sowing the seeds of some future imbalances  it does significantly rely on a reversing at the right time  and to the extent that we are prepared to do that i think the language is good i would prefer the language sometimes in alternative cif not today then at some point as we transition to this the three factors language is fine  im fine with very low as well and also with 175 billion i am also looking forward to the discussions about how we reverse ourselves and the discussions of asset sales or interest on reserves and how to juxtapose those very hard choices that we have ahead of us and i think that will be an important part of our future deliberations  so alternative b as you are describing it i think will be the way to go with my preferences noted  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart thank you mr chairman  like so many others i support the policy choice in alternative b  i interpret this as a staythecourse option  for the most part i support the language in draft alternative b but i do have some reservations about the changes in paragraph 3 from the september statement 
im not sure i see the benefit of replacing the assertion that the committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for an extended period with the new statement of low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation and inflation expectations  i think its generally understood that the conditionality of our decisions is based on resource utilization inflation and inflation expectations  so i think this could be interpreted as trying to emphasize something new by changing the language in this way and i suspect it could be interpreted as implying increased focus on the unemployment rate which of course im sympathetic with as a criterion but we may very well begin to initiate tightening before theres any substantial improvement in unemployment  so i think this could serve to confuse more than illuminate so i dont see a percentage in a lot of forward guidance at this point and i would prefer simply to stick with the language that we used in september 
i am concerned based on some of my soundings in the financial markets that were sort of in a strange loop dilemma were not ready to initiate tightening at least through the policy rate but changes in the extended period language including maybe even the words around that language depending on how theyre interpreted could create an unwanted adjustment in rate levels that would amount to tightening  so i prefer that we start to signal when were much closer to action 
as regards the 175 billion agency debt purchases language i would have the concern that this could be misinterpreted but i think the adjustments between the first draft and the draft we have in front of us adequately explain this as very much a technical matter so it will avoid misinterpretation or overinterpretation  so im comfortable with that  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke president fisher   
mr fisher  mr chairman with a norwegian mother and australian father im genetically disposed toward alternative c given that those are the two central banksthe only thing that they had in commonthat recently raised their rates  but i wont argue for it i dont think its timely and i favor alternative b  i did note in the statement issued yesterday by the reserve bank of australia the following  it said that it is prudent to lessen gradually the degree of monetary stimulus that was put in place when the outlook appeared to be much weaker  one of the things i worry about is that we are finding our statements in constant iterations from a period when we feared depression 20 deflation 20  what im hearing at the table and looking at the estimates of economic growth going forward is that depression 20 is no longer a risk but i still hearperhaps selectively because i fear it myself and through the retailers that i speak tothat there still is a risk of deflation  i dont think were out of the woods on that front 
so im encouraged by at least the latter part of brians presentation  the alternatives have been laid out  on that front i would simply say that i would personally be in favor of asset sales first and i hope we can flesh that out somewhat  on the other options that have been presented and the way they are being phrased i would like to consult my team back at home and then perhaps send in a memo brian with some suggestions 
i am concerned about the dollar  mr chairman you raised this as one of the possible dislocations resulting from low interest rates  other people who intervened governor tarullo and others have mentioned the dollar  in thinking this through and how we phrase alternative b i put on my old hat as a foreign exchange adviser which i did for four years at brown brothers advising corporations in the late 1970s and early 1980s certainly different times as to how treasurers should position themselves and how speculators should position themselves were i doing that today i would be advising say a large russian trader like vitol which is the largest speculative oil traderbigger in terms of financial positions in the world than shell or bpon a dollar play based on the language you have in this statement because its not simply the level but also the predictability and duration  so as an adviser were i reading that languagethat were going to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended periodto me it would be great kindling wood for the carry trade  i do believe that thats a risk and a problem right now  it may be less of a risk for us per se but if i know that i can borrow dollars cheaply and have this likely for an extended period im going to jam as much into the a dollar as much into the brazilian real and as much into these little currencies and move those markets as i can  i do believe it has something to do with the price of oil i think in a great deal of the pricing of oil currently given the excess inventory thats on the seas and given the excess inventory of gas and other alternatives to oil the dollar is clearly a significant factor 
therefore my one suggestionwhich i dont think will carry the table but im going to put it out there anywayis that if we do change the term extended period to change it for some time  i think that would throw enough uncertainty into those who are pursuing the carry trade and very importantly to those corporate treasurers who are not repatriating capital because they find the ability to earn a return here is less than what they can earn somewhere else and it might mitigate the risk of the kind of dollar crisis that we all fear  but thats the only suggestion i have mr chairman from a practicable standpoint  other than that i would embrace alternative b  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  president evans 
mr evans thank you mr chairman  you know in the old days it wasnt uncommon at this point for the committee members to begin to say i agree with the chairman and have a pretty quick commentary but since you dont do it that way ill just say that today i agree with president yellen and governor kohn  the unemployment rate is headed toward 10 percent or above inflation by my forecast is well underrunning my inflation guideline of 2 percent  for me this suggests a low likelihood of a policy switch for some time  frankly any tightening of the fed funds rate for lack of a better policy tool before june 2010 seems unlikely to me  its not a zero probability  it seems small  maybe it will be later as governor kohn said  i personally find it very difficult to say that but it could be true  and this is my view of appropriate policy by the way not just a prediction of what the committee will do  it is a statecontingent viewpoint and its not a promise 
in terms of the statement language i think that the statement should provide an accurate description of how we view the risks and the policy markers  i think the list is good  president lacker suggested very low resource utilization  that could be okay  some other possibilities are unusually low exceptionally low notably low and historically low  if the unemployment rate goes to 8 percent its still going to be pretty low real resource utilization  so i dont really think that that has a shocking implication for how policy would change 
but that said our statement is only one form of communication  you do testimony  others do that we have speeches  and small changes in language generate phone calls from a number of people who used to be on the board asking what does this mean in terms of exceptionally low or just low or something like that  so there are a lot of different ways that we communicate  i think that the statement should be descriptive  i dont think it should necessarily be proscriptive or even prescriptive  if the events and the risks change and change quickly policy can change 
in summary mr chairman i think that policy is likely to stay at low rates for an extended period  i agree with alternative b 
chairman bernanke okay thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto thank you mr chairman  i also support alternative b  i think the language in b acknowledges the improvement in economic conditions that we saw last quarter but limits the importance of that information in a way that i think is appropriate 
when i read the initial version of alternative b before we had the benefit of the bluebooks explanation in which the staff laid out a communication strategy i was concerned that the public would not understand why we were making this change in the language in paragraph 3 from our september statement around economic conditions  i was also concerned as i said earlier about leading the public to focus on just the three factors that are listed  i think this new language is more flexible in a constructive way and yet it is still consistent with the staffs communication strategy that has been laid out 
in regard to the communication strategy i also want to express my appreciation to brian and the staff for being so responsive to our request that a communication strategy be laid out that will line up with and support our exit strategy  the sequence of statements that youve given us is very constructive it will give us time to think about and adjust the language well in advance of our having to take action  so i just want to thank you for doing that  it was very helpful  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you president kocherlakota 
mr kocherlakota thank you mr chairman  the ninth district economic conditions are only slightly changed from september  nationally economic conditions are only slightly different from what was forecast in the september greenbook  given these observations i believe that the fomc should follow a policy that is consistent with its statement in september that is alternative b 
im sympathetic to president lockharts concerns about the change in languageabout becoming more specific about what economic conditions mean  im not sure what has changed economically since september for us to make those changes in wording and im worried that market participants might be trying to figure out what we have seen to make us make those changes  i was very happy to see and impressed by the thoughtful discussion in the bluebook about future scenarios and language  i think we need to do more of that going forward 
i was concerned like many others around the table that the discussion seemed to deemphasize the use of asset sales as part of our exit strategy and my own view is that we should be considering such sales seriously probably well before we begin to increase the interest rate on reserves  asset sales can have significant benefits  some of these have been stressed by earlier speakers  one benefit is i think just purely financial  our holdings of agency mbs and agency debt imply that were heavily involved in the market for home loans  when financial markets were functioning poorly this involvement could be readily justified  now financial markets are functioning much better it is good time for us to reconsider our involvement in housing finance  some questions we might ask ourselves along those lines are would holding our portfolio to maturity really enhance the liquidity of these markets would sales actually do more to help liquidity in these markets 
another benefit which has not been so much stressed by earlier speakers has to do with a concern of mine about controlling inflation risk  on the other side of the balance sheet our asset holdings imply that banks are holding large amounts of excess reserves  these reserves represent an inflation risk generated by potential changes in household expectations  my logic here is fairly simple  if households believe that the price level is about to rise then they will demand moreliquid deposits in order to make their transactions  the fact that banks are holding so much in the way of excess reserves means they can readily accommodate this extra demand for deposits because they have the ability to do so  the extra deposits in the hands of households become extra money chasing the same amount of goods which generates inflation  in this way excess reserves provide a vehicle for household expectations about inflation to become reality 
if you think about this in this quantitative way the inflationary potential in the system is extraordinary banks are currently holding over 1 trillion in excess reserves  with a reserve requirement of 10 percent sufficient household demand can generate 10 trillion in liquid deposits in the hands of the public  such extra deposits would put enormous pressure on the price level why might households expect inflation  the government debt in the hands of the public has expanded over 30 percent in the past two years  this debt as the chairman and i discussed earlier can be paid in only two ways by the feds printing money or by the congresss collecting taxes  if the public starts to believe that the congress will not collect the required taxes then the price level must rise either today or in the future  again excess reserves allow these changes in household expectations about fiscal policy to translate very directly into inflationary pressures 
now i want to be absolutely clear  i am not arguing that large quantities of excess reserves imply in any way that were guaranteed to have high inflation  this argument can be wrong empirically and theoretically  but my concern is that the large quantity of excess reserves makes possible a high inflation outcome  like market participants like the people around this table i currently view this outcome as being of very low probability  recent events have suggested though that our conduct of policy should take account of exactly these kinds of lowprobability adverse outcomes 
so i believe that we need to reduce the amount of excess reserves in the system  it is clear that we can do so by selling off some of our existing assets  the bluebook suggests using temporary absorption techniques such as reverse repos or term deposit facilities  these approaches certainly work toward ameliorating the kind of problem that ive described  however im less confident about their ability to eliminate the problem entirely  these shortterm arrangements seem much more vulnerable to sudden shifts in household expectations of the kind that ive sketched  im stressing the benefits of asset sales and they certainly have costs as well  my point is simply that i think that going forward we need to do some systematic comparisons of the costs and benefits as opposed to simply downplaying their role in our exit strategy  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you  just a couple of comments  saying that reserves facilitate deposits implies that the banks have to lend the money to the consumers 
mr kocherlakota yes 
chairman bernanke so they are at the moment not lending as you know and if they were to lend it would show up in inflation but also show up in aggregate demand  so presumably both of our objectives would be moving  thus it would be appropriate for us to tighten through interest rates and through other mechanisms in that case 
several people have mentioned asset sales and i thought president bullards point about last infirst out was an interesting way to think about it  i want to point out just the practical point that we are committed now to purchasing through the end of the first quarter  so to do that youre essentially putting off any interest rate response until late next year  that may be the right thing to do but it may be inconvenient to do it given that our commitment to purchase goes into next year  governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me talk about two things with respect to policy first the mortgagebacked securities which have been much discussed and second the third paragraph and the suggestions therein  first on the mbsno surprise  im pleased that were ending and announcing the end of our purchases with respect to both mbs and agency debt  on the agency debt side i dont think its likely to be misunderstood or misinterpreted but backchannel communications there could be constructive  with respect to the mortgagebacked securities i think we may well have overstayed and outstayed our welcome but at least providing clarity that we are at this moment completing our purchases early next year is useful  it may turn out that rates move even over the intermeeting period as brian sack and bill dudley suggested in anticipation of the end of that program  i think they are anticipating some move and from our perspective its okay it will be interesting to see what the fiscal and political authorities think about our comfort with that move in thirtyyear fixedrate mortgages and what sorts of responses they either ask of us or ask of themselves there  as i think we all know the form and function of the gses is likely to get more attention come next year 
the exit problems that were talking about with respect to mortgagebacked securities factored into some of our thinking about the purchases after these markets started functioning  i guess you should add me to the camp of those who are certainly open minded and even forward leaning about thinking about the net benefits of bringing some liquidity and duration back to those markets at the appropriate time which is not now  and mr chairman i think it is at least as important that we dont signal that 1 trillion or 125 trillion of mbs are permanently off the market  i think that is likely to be unconstructive and restricting of our options going forward if markets come to that view  so not only for our own internal purposes of thinking about it but also given the uncertainties about the mortgage finance market i think making sure thats one of a number of alternatives that we talk about more publicly at this point would be useful 
turning to policy in the third paragraph i think that the additions and the including phrase are actually quite useful they amplify the conditions that underscore our conditiondependent forecast i noted and giggled like many of you when brian showed the number of speeches by fomc members in this intermeeting period and i guess id make a couple notes about it  first i saw remarkable accord then and frankly around this table about the conduct of policy  i think with the exception of the president who represents the game 6 loser of the world series laughter  
mr plosser  new york   
mr warsh  that there is at least to this point remarkable accord that rates are low and will need to stay very low for quite some time  id say that theres a second bit of agreement among those thirty speeches and that is that we are all very humble about what the risks of that forecast are very humble and uncertain about the 201011 forecast  where there are differences they are over what we think the risks are when we get ready to change regimes  what are the risks on the inflation front or on the output front or some other exogenous variable  and ive been impressed by the markets through these 30 speeches  markets did not bring forward not even a little bit the time at which policy could become less accommodative   
what did we see though  markets became less certain about the degree of what that move might be and i think in some ways their variance on the speed of that policy accommodation matches at least what ive heard today  i dont view that as a troubling development at all  i think what were doing in amplifying the economic conditions and referencing utilization inflation trends and inflation expectations is making very clear to them that those are uncertainties of ours and theirs and we arent trying to prejudge what their own judgments on those should be  so i think that the market for information is improving and will be improved by our being just a little more explicit on those fronts and i think that variance is frankly quite a useful thing 
with respect to the question of whether we should use the word including i do think its useful  while everything i suppose could be reduced to these three phrases that speak to our dual mandate i wouldnt want markets to have the impression that we are immune to what could be going on in the world geopolitically with respect to the foreign exchange value of the dollar or with respect to asset prices  so i think it is credibility enhancing to suggest that we understand the uncertainties in this world and i would strongly support including it  i dont think that by using the word including were suggesting there is some secret condition that we are hiding from their view  its just acknowledging those uncertainties  with that i support alternative b as drafted  while i think it will get a reasonable amount of attention on these three phases i consider it consistent with intermeeting speeches and also consistent with the discussions weve had today  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you  governor duke 
ms duke thank you mr chairman  i would like first to pile a little onto governor warshs comments about the mortgagebacked securities market  the financial improvement does not extend to mortgage instruments  as recently as the last meeting i was concerned that the lack of a housing finance system would require our continued purchase of the mbs even beyond the first quarter of next year  ive thought about this a lot in the intermeeting period and ive come to the conclusion that just as we found with the talf there are some markets that our tools cant fix  i dont see how our economy fully recovers without the true resolution of fannie and freddie and clarity in the role of government in housing finance and the structure of privatelabel loan securitizations  in my opinion it is much more important than homebuyer tax credits but i dont think either our continued purchase or holding of these securities can substitute for such a policy  with that i would like to agree with president evans in his comments particularly his agreement with president yellen and governor kohn and support alternative b 
chairman bernanke thank you governor tarullo 
mr tarullo thank you mr chairman  like everybody i think i support the policy actions set forth in alternative b  i do have some concerns about the language specifically the insertion of the including phrase at the beginning of paragraph 3  i didnt have those concerns when brian circulated the language  i didnt have those concerns after brian explained to me why the language is in there  but after this meeting i do have them laughter and let me explain why 
firstthis is a secondary point but i will mention iti am somewhat bemused by the inflation expectations criterion  for a social scientist to put such weight on such a slippery metric whose relationship to outcomes historically is as i understand it not particularly well established empirically has just surprised mesomething that i hadnt focused on before being on the board  thats something that i look forward to hearing more about in the december meeting when we have a full presentation of the academic work behind inflation more generally 
i understand that faith and intuition are important elements in economic policy making  so in and of itself that concern wouldnt have moved me to speak  i guess where i do have a concern is on the issue of what this phrase will communicate  this is going to be the news out of this statement  everything else is expected  some of the things that some people expected to be in here are not going to be in here and therefore this is going to be the only thing for people to focus on 
to the extent that the including phrase is understood as a positive statement of the principal factors that the 17 people around the table will be looking at over the coming meetings i think that would enhance communications and i took it that that was the reason it was included in the statement originally  but unlike kevin i didnt find the 30 speeches a wholly positive and productive development after the last fomc meeting  my own sense from talking to a number of market actors was that they thought that there was confusion within the committee which they thought undermined within a very short period of time the fomc statement itself  i dont think it was serious and i think people kind of bounced back and some of the sophisticated analysts did a very nice job on our behalf of teasing out the points of agreement and putting them out to markets more generally  but just having listened to the conversation i am concerned that the release of this statement with the including phrase will be quickly followed by a litigation of the meaning and relative importance of each of these three items in a series of public statements and when some people start making the public statements other people are going to be moved to make public statements that kind of go a bit on the other side  therefore i am concerned that what began as a nicely stated positive assertion of the principal factors that we all some of us more than others will be looking at will fairly quickly devolve into a bit of cacophony 
now it may be that markets will just look at who the speakers are and say okay  well this is nothing new from this person and so it wont be that serious  but to the degree that what were looking for in the next three four five six meetings is the capacity to speak more or less with one voice on how we plan to move ahead and eventually how we plan to exit i fear that were setting a notterrific precedent for our capacity to do so  and so mr chairman although i certainly wouldnt even dream of opposing alternative b if you choose to keep the language in i guess my own preference would have been to hold this language until perhaps the december meeting after weve had a chance to talk about at least the inflation considerations in a bit more detail in the hopes that the positive statement at that time would reflect a greater level of consensus among the seventeen of us  thank you 
chairman bernanke thank you vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b i think that people have raised important points that the changes in the language will be noted and that people will be trying to parse out what those changes in the language mean  there is some risk associated with that especially given the fact that the public knows pretty clearly that we are also contemplating the broader question of the possible sequence of our statement language over time  that said i think the changes themselves are pretty innocuous and my view would be that there is a little risk there  i think i know which direction the market will move in response to them but my judgment would be that they are small rather than they are large  the first change just clarifies what the conditioning factors are in terms of our view of exceptionally low for an extended period and the second change is really just explaining what we are actually planning to do on agency debt i dont think we really have an alternative to that because if we kept in the up to 200 billion what would we do at the next meeting what would we do at the meeting after that  at some point we would be saying right before the program ends that we are doing up to 200 billion but were not we are doing 175 billion  so i think that one we just have to do to clarify the direction 
in terms of the discussions of asset sales i think the issue of sequencein what order you do thingsas we exit is hugely important  i am not precommitted to any ordering  i certainly want to hear all of the arguments but i dont agree at all that asset sales would be gentle to the market at this time  i think asset sales to the market at this time would be completely ungentle especially given the primary dealer survey results which showed fewer than 50 percent thought that we would ever do asset sales  i think it is an openended question isnt it brian  so to go from something that we would never do to something that we would do first i think we have to do a lot of explaining and conditioning for the market to understand that it was not a big deal so if we decide to go down that path weve got a lot of work to do with the market participants before we do it 
i just want to talk a bit about the possible sequence of actions going forward  one thing we dont ever really have detailed discussions about is what the language means and i think you have to understand what the language means before you decide when you need to change the language i have asked a bunch of people about what these words mean just to get a sense of what the common understanding is and there isnt one  but i am going to throw out as a strawman my view of what the words mean because that will then condition when you might want to actually change these words 
my view is that extended means that no tightening is likely for more than six months so the time frame is pretty far out  so in making the consideration today whether i want to include the extended language i have to think about whether it is likely that i am going to want to tighten monetary policy in the next six months  and given my forecast i dont see that as likely i am with governor kohn  i dont see us tightening in 2010  i think we are going to talk a lot about it but i dont think we are going to do it for a very long time  the for some time language rather than the extended period implies to me no tightening for three months or more  we are not going to tighten at the next meeting  it is possible that we could tighten the meeting after that but that is sort of the frontier  and the before long language seems to me to be signaling that we are likely to tighten at the next meeting in fact 
now what gets confusing is when we use two things together as in alternative c in brians handout we removed the word exceptional and changed it to low levels of the funds rate and we also changed the timing from extended period to for some time  i think that is going to be totally confusing to the market  i think the market would actually take that as that we are tightening at the next meeting  we are moving from exceptionally low to low immediately and then we are going to stay at low for a meeting or two  so i think we have to be very careful when we change the language that we change one element not two simultaneously  then i think we will get ourselves in a lot of trouble  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke thank you very much  well most people supported the actions in alternative b that is my preference as well  let me talk about some of the issues of language that were raised and see if we have any desire to make changes  i dont think anybody at all mentioned the first paragraph which is a first  so perhaps forget that for now  on the second paragraph there were a couple of suggestions to substitute the language in paragraph 2 of alternative c i think it would be risky to do that  i would note one logical issue which is that the c 2 language suggests a somewhat different conditionality which is that policy will be focused on price stability which it certainly will be but it would be kind of strange to introduce conditionality in two places with a somewhat different mix of factors  but i recognize that issue 
so now lets go to the third paragraph where the main concerns are  to avoid for a moment the most important sentence one or two folks had concerns about being explicit about the 175 billion the vice chairman suggested that we have to do it in order to be transparent  could i maybe ask brian madigan and brian sack or anyone else if they have any thoughts on the market impact of this statement   
mr madigan go ahead brian 
mr sack well we did reach out and take a poll of various players in the agency debt market  it seems as though the expectations are generally between 175 billion and 200 billion maybe a touch higher than we had been thinking so i think there is a modest surprise here  but it is modest  i wouldnt worry about it could agency spreads back up a little sure will there be a lot of talk about why and what this means yes absolutely 
chairman bernanke the concernwe tried to respond to president yellens suggestionwas to make sure that nobody confused this with an intentional tightening  and i guess i would like reassurance that we have explained what we are doing here  right 
mr madigan i agree i think our sense is that overall the statement is not likely to have much of a market impact 
mr sack right and we changed the language exactly to accomplish that to convey that this is consistent with what we have been doing already 
chairman bernanke okay vice chairman 
vice chairman dudley if there is starting to be a reaction to this there may be some value to having a background conversation to make it clear that this is not a change  i wouldnt do it beforehand because we dont know that we have a problem  but if the market does take it the wrong way which i think is a low probability you might want to have a background conversation 
mr lacker or we can make 30 speeches 
vice chairman dudley that is probably not sufficient  laughter 
chairman bernanke all right  so lets go to the main sentence which is about the extended period first a couple of comments  i do think we need to maintain the extended period for now i think most of the people around the table agreed with that given the macro outlook 
i am sensitive to president fishers comments about the carry trade  in fact i tried to underline those issues when i gave my own remarks  president fisher you had asked nathan yesterday about this issue and he pointed out that there is a good carry trade and a bad carry trade the good carry trade is the appropriate response of asset prices to low interest rates essentially and that shows up in exchange rates  it shows up in other asset prices as well  the bad carry trade is when people behave as if they know for sure that interest rates will be low forever and exchange rates will be stable or at least they go in a oneway direction  i have always had difficulty with the latter because it is not an arbitrage  it is an irrational response  but all i can say is that this is something we really do need to pay attention to  i agree with that and i mentioned this in my remarks  so it is a concern but we also have our macroeconomic concerns president fisher  
mr fisher mr chairman i simply wanted to point that out  it is not clear to me if we were to have a run on the dollar in an intermeeting period what we would do  would we raise interest rates what would we do  so all i am saying is that we might consider this  i am not going to argue for it i dont think it is going to carry but i just wanted to be sensitive to it  about the only thing we can do is the way we express ourselves to say or to have the secretary of the treasury sayas every secretary not just tim has said foreveri believe in a strong dollar policy that doesnt sound anymore in the marketplace  it has been said so many times by so many people it just doesnt ring  so i wonder what we would do under these circumstances and the only point i wanted to make is if we are worried about this if we are at a tipping point or when we get to that that maybe a little language change might help because it takes away the permanence  it shortens and builds a lexicon for the period but i dont want to make too big a deal out of it  i am concerned about it 
chairman bernanke i think there are various language things that policymakers including myself president trichet and others could use to address this to some extent more credibly of course we dont want to talk about this hereit is a bad wordbut there is always intervention which seems to have an effect 
okay so on the sentencegovernor tarullo i think raised the possibility of delaying the conditionality i thought most people were in favor of taking this step  are there others who are concerned  i recognize that any change is risky but we cant avoid the risk  at some point we have to move in a direction  maybe this is not the right moment  but is there anyone else who is concerned 
mr lockhart i spoke against it 
chairman bernanke president lockhart thats right  yes sorry 
mr kocherlakota i spoke against it too 
chairman bernanke all right so we have some  i think though that the majority are stilli think there is a bit of risk but 
vice chairman dudley there is a bit of risk but there is always going to be risk when we change language the problem with that of course is that we lock ourselves into the statement more and more which then makes it even a bigger risk when we change language  so its a very bad dynamic 
chairman bernanke thats right that was part of the way i was thinking about this 
mr kocherlakota for me it would be helpful to hear an explanation why it is now suddenly so useful to be so specific as opposed to in the past  that is something i dont understand 
chairman bernanke the reason is essentially that what we have now is interpreted as a sort of an unconditional commitment toeven though we say economic conditions will warrant it seems like an unconditional commitment to hold rates for six months or more as the vice chairman was saying  i think doing this helps to emphasize the conditionality of our commitment so that we would be able to change if economic conditions changed notably and although there may be some adverse reaction because people think this is a step to exiti think thats a riskit will also be an increase in clarity and transparency  yes governor tarullo 
mr tarullo just to clarify or to restate what i said earlier i agree with bill dudley  i think that all things considered sooner rather than later is actually better because you are not locked in but the risk associated with the statement is not simply a function of the statement itself on the day it is released and that was the pointwe are in a position to minimize the riskiness associated with the statement and i would just urge everybody to bear that in mind particularly over the next 72 hours 
chairman bernanke president evans 
mr evans im having a hard time appreciating in some precise way what we mean by the risk in terms of this language  i understand that markets react to every change that we make and then sometimes the reaction is undone  sometimes it changes things  but i am of the opinion that when we have a pretty good approach to monetary policy we are pretty forthright in describing what we are doing markets somehow figure out what we are doing and these are well within the lines in terms of those types of changes 
chairman bernanke well i think the risk is that the markets will move forward the tightening path which i dont think is consistent with expectations in most of the committee 
mr evans then you go out and somebody talks and somebody really important talks and it gets clarified  when people rely extraordinarily on the statement then we begin to feel locked in 
chairman bernanke the counterargument is that we can only put this off  all right recognizing that there is some risk we will have to see what happens 
the last question i want to ask was raised by president lacker first and i think others which is the phrase low rates of resource utilization  now ironically the reason that i was in favor of dropping very was in deference to president lacker  laughter  i thought that it would be a concern that we could measure output gaps distinguish between the output gaps that are very large and just ordinarily large  in that spirit i was concerned that adding very would then create a cottage industry figuring out the dividing line between very and not so very  that was part of my concern  i can be persuaded if the committee approves that 
but the other possibility i would just raise would be that this sentence very much echoes the terms in paragraph 2  paragraph 2 already refers to longerterm inflation expectations being stable and inflation being subdued  and i think it actually elaborates because it talks about longerterm inflation expectations and about forwardlooking inflation projections  so in that spirit it wouldnt be particularly elegant but we could replace low rates of resource utilization with substantial resource slack if that was preferred  someone liked that 
mr plosser i like low rates of 
chairman bernanke you like low rates of utilization 
mr plosser better than resource slack 
chairman bernanke okay all right 
vice chairman dudley that is more an output gap idea i think   
chairman bernanke president lacker 
mr lacker i would point out there is going to be a cottage industry no matter what 
chairman bernanke right 
mr lacker the question is what is the object of their endeavors in their cottages  laughter so they are going to be focusing on low versus very low  it seems as though very low is the right thing to focus their attention on  it seems like a more accurate characterization 
mr tarullo this again seems to me to be prejudging rather than to have a criterion which is just to reiterate what my concern is about this whole endeavor 
mr plosser but they speculate that on what we mean anyway  
mr lacker well i would just reiterate that we are conveying a set of conditions under which we anticipate retaining low rates and narrowing that range of conditions only reduces the amount of precommitment  so it makes it a more inclusive broader weaker statement in some sense  
chairman bernanke i think it makes it a stronger statement because it could mean that even if inflation is low and expectations of inflation are low that if unemployment falls below 8 percent then well start to move which might be possible but i wouldnt want to commit to that 
mr lacker i go back to the way the sentence reads  it doesnt say only if economic conditions are  it just says if  it is if this then lowit doesnt say if not this then raising rates 
chairman bernanke well i think that is how it would be interpreted  okay i will try both possible options  if there is not majority support we will just stay with what we have so first i didnt see much support for substantial resource slack  was there anybody nobody wants to support that 
vice chairman dudley  groundswell 
chairman bernanke groundswell is supported  all right well be democratic  what is the view on very  who favors very anyone else all right so i think we have about as much of a consensus as we can get  well having gone through this at some length we have ended up with the status quo laughter  any further comments or thoughts on b 
all right  again i appreciate the commentary  i think the points that were raised in the policy round considering not only todays statement but also about how we will exit and how we will communicate it are very important  and of course the staff will continue to work on both the policy regime and the communication associated with it 
if you will call the roll please matt
