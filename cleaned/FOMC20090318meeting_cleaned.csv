dan has been here for a while and hes already making very substantial contributions  were
happy to welcome him to the table  ill also mention that we will have a dinner tonight and our
special guest will be randy kroszner  this is a joint boardfomc meeting so i need a motion
to close the board meeting
mr kohn  so moved
chairman bernanke  without objection  the first item on the agenda is desk
operations and liquidity programs  the fomc asked for lots of information and now youre
going to be sorry  laughter  we have a record number of presenters who are going to cover a
range of issues relating to our balance sheet our lending programs and a variety of policy
options  in order to make sure this is not a threeday meeting id like you to hold your non
clarifying questions till the end  if you have clarifying questions by all means ask them but at
the end well have an opportunity for full qa for the presenters  so let me turn it over now to
trish mosser
ms mosser1   thank you mr chairman  financial market developments during the intermeeting period have been driven largely by three factors  continued sharp deterioration in global economic conditions uncertainty and pessimism about the health of financial firms particularly commercial banks and reactions to a wide range of unconventional policy measures by many central banks and governments
despite last weeks rally as exhibit 1 shows global equity prices are sharply lower  the sp 500 has fallen 16 percent since the beginning of the year  of course this is much better than a week ago as of last monday the sp 500 was down

1  materials used by ms mosser are appended to this document appendix 1
25 percent for the year  foreign stock markets which had fallen 15 percent to 25 percent from the beginning of the year to a week ago monday are now down
only 5 percent to 17 percent for the year  this of course reflects the deep nearly global recession which has occurred in response to the financial crisis  the sharp contraction in credit is now a global phenomenon resulting in credit losses
writedowns and financial deleveraging occurring nearly everywhere
financial firms also had a bit of a respite last week in part based on predictions of better first quarter earnings but overall they remain very distressed  the continued uncertainty regarding both the health of financial firms as well as the nature of government assistance programs has weighed on their capital structures  as can be seen in exhibit 2 both common and preferred equity indexes for financial firms are down sharply during the intermeeting period  in fact preferred equity of financials has fallen more than 20 percent since late january while common equity prices are down less than 10 percent reflecting increased risk of suspended dividends or conversion of preferred equity to common  this trend is even more pronounced for those firms that have already received government capital and thus for which the possibility of losses further up the capital structure is perceived to be largest
perhaps more jarring is the very large widening of financial firms cds spreads in recent weeks which can be seen in exhibits 3 through 5  bank cds spreads are now significantly wider than they were during the height of the financial turmoil last fall following the lehman bankruptcy  this is truly extraordinary in light of the government programs that have been announced or expanded in recent weeks  the fdic guarantee program the announcement of the administrations stabilization plan and several public statements that systemically important firms will not be allowed to fail during the current crisis
the widening of cds spreads reflects several factors  first in the us there is deep concern that the current bank stress assessment will result in actual or de facto nationalization of some institutions this raises the possibility that debt holders as well as equity holders will take a hit  second financial firms with more opaque balance sheetscommercial banks insurance companies and some finance companies such as ge capitalhave experienced larger increases in cds spreads  the lack of clarity about the size of toxic assets and how legacy accrual assets will be marked has led to questions about their viability  in fact its notable that the cds spreads of the two former investment banks which largely mark their balance sheets to market have not widened in recent weeks although they remain at very high levels  third market liquidity continues to deteriorate in nearly every market where the fed has not intervened including cds  thus the price impact of even small cds trades and small positions can move spreads sharply for example a relatively small number of investors continuing to take short positions in financial cds may be responsible for the bulk of the price action in recent weeks  finally and perhaps most importantly investors are very concerned about whether the strings attached to government assistance for financial institutions or markets will be changed in the future  in particular the risk that the rules of the game for debt investors will be changed
after investments have been madehas risen sharply in recent weeks  to quote a member of our treasury market practices group the rules coming from washington change every other day no one is willing to invest in anything  its worth noting that this risk extends beyond investments in banks and is a reason that some investors are not planning to use the talf no matter how attractive the economics of the program may be
in response to continued deterioration in both economic and financial conditions central banks around the world have eased monetary policy conditions to an unprecedented degree in recent weeks  of the g20 central banks eighteen have eased monetary policy since the beginning of the year  in addition exhibit 6 shows that most of the major central banks have lowered interest rates to near zero and embarked on programs to expand their balance sheets through additional liquidity programs as well as crediteasing and quantitativeeasing programs  crediteasing programs have generally focused on purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds outside of the us  in the us the investmentgrade corporate bond market is the rare credit market that is operating fairly normally but this is not the case in many countries
the local market responses to these new programssome of which i will discuss in a momenthave generally been positive but their relative impact globally is harder to discern  in particular movements in major dollar fx rates exhibit 7 do not appear to be closely related to changes in policy stance the degree of central bank balance sheet expansion or relative economic prospects  for example one might expect the euro or at least the canadian dollar to have appreciated relative to the
us dollar since the beginning of the year given the euro areas higher policy rates and the canadian economys relative stability  but in fact the dollar has appreciated against nearly every major currency since the beginning of the year  certainly the dollars position as a reserve currency and its continued status as a safe haven have contributed to its appreciation
last weeks intervention by the swiss national bank to weaken the swiss franc relative to the euro exhibit 8 is one reflection of concern over the deflationary impact of an appreciating currency  the snbs intervention last thursday pushed the swiss franc down nearly 3 percent relative to the euro in a matter of minutes
while the snb does not plan to engage in ongoing competitive devaluations preventing a sharp appreciation of the currency particularly visvis the euro is a key component in its quantitativeeasing plan to prevent deflation
however the united kingdom probably wins the prize for the most aggressive quantitativeeasing plan at least in terms of its timetable  two weeks ago the bank of england announced an assetpurchase program focused on commercial paper corporate bonds and government securities  given the limited size of uk credit markets the boe announced that the majority of the purchases will be of government bonds and specifically over the next three months they will purchase as much as
75 billion of gilts in the 5 to 25year maturity range
the planned boe gilt purchases amount to 5 percent of uk gdp nearly
12 percent of total gilts and 18 percent of nominal gilts held by the public  to put this in some perspective a similarsized program in the united states by these metrics would entail purchases of us treasuries ranging from 585 billion up to nearly 750 billion over a threemonth period
since the announcement gilt yields have fallen 19 53 and 79 basis points in the 5 10 and 20year maturities respectively but 2year yields have risen 38 basis pointsthey are not buying 2year gilts  as shown in exhibit 9 most of this was an announcement effect  interestingly the spread between the policy rate and the
10year yield in the uk exhibit 10 did not decline  in other words longterm yields have fallen in parallel with the policy rate  finally private credit yields did decline with the policy action particularly corporate bonds which the bank of england will also purchase  however as noted in exhibit 11 other yields notably swaps fell significantly less than government yields leading to an increase in swap spreads
turning now to our own assetpurchase programs we have continued to purchase both agency mbs and debt at a steady pace  agency debt purchases now amount to nearly 47 billion and mbs outright purchases total 219 billion as well as an additional 69 billion in dollar rolls which i will discuss in a moment  exhibit 12 shows that the spreads of both agency debt and mbs to treasury yields have been fairly stable since the last fomc meeting  notably however the conforming mortgage rate to households has continued to decline to about 5 percent
there are several reasons for this including the introduction of our dollar roll program in early march  in the first week of march there was a nearly 100 basis point drop in the forward financing rate for mbs relative to the mbs cash repo rate exhibit 13  you may recall that the dollar roll market is like a repo market for forward delivery of agency mbs  to give an example the marchapril dollar roll transaction which is what were purchasing now is a transaction that simultaneously purchases mbs for delivery in march and sells identical mbs to be delivered in april  by participating in the dollar roll market we have lowered the cost of managing mortgage inventory and moved forward financing spreads back to levels that prevailed before last falls turmoil
in addition as the refinancing wave from january abates mortgage lenders ability to process new mortgages has increased and they have tended to lower rates to borrowers  finally retail spreads while high have come down because of the improved liquidity and predictability of conditions in the secondary mortgage market since our purchase program began in january other investors and arbitrageurs have followed us into the mbs market  not only are bidasked spreads lower but as shown in exhibit 14 the daily price volatility of new mbs has declined steadily reducing uncertainty about prices at which new mortgages can be sold
while our mbs purchase program has helped to lower mbs spreads from the exceptional levels seen last fall they remain very high by historical standards as shown in exhibit 15  in contrast to the treasury yield curve which is shown in exhibit 16 mortgage spreads do not appear to have a predictable relationship to the business cycle  the treasury curve while steep seems consistent with past episodes of economic weakness
in anticipation of daves and joes discussion of largescale asset purchases exhibit 17 scales our asset purchases so far relative to upcoming new issuance  to date the mbs program purchases are very close in size to the overall new issuance in the mbs market  however market expectations are for a large refinancing wave during 2009 the result of low rates and mortgage relief programs  the median estimate is for 18 trillion in new issuance but estimates vary widelyfrom under
1 trillion to 3 trillion  for comparison a median estimate of longterm treasury issuance is also shown  at our current pace of purchasing we will not keep up with expected new mbs issuance
finally i want to say a few words about policy expectations and the impact of our programs  exhibit 18 shows the results of the desks latest survey of dealer economists along with marketimplied expectations for the future policy rate  most dealers continue to expect policy rates to stay close to zero until at least the second quarter of 2010 and to remain below 1 percent into 2011  marketimplied expectations continue to be skewed upward but we believe this probably reflects the high risk premiums in future eurodollar rates rather than an accurate reading of policy expectations
markets directly supported by fed programs continued to function reasonably well  however as seen in exhibit 19 both secured and unsecured money market rates have increased modestly in recent weeks  the increase in libor rates largely reflects increased credit risk of banks and is consistent with the rise in bank cds spreads  the rise in treasury repo rates in contrast reflects the large treasury issuance and associated ample supply of treasury collateral for lending
spreads on consumerassetbacked securities have narrowed somewhat since the last fomc meeting in anticipation of the first talf subscription which opened today  our expectations for the first talf subscription are modest with a few billion dollars of lending against abs most likely backed by auto and credit card lending  bill will be saying more about the talf in a few minutes
spence will discuss various aspects of the balance sheet in more detail  however i would like to point out in exhibit 20 the continued decline in the size of our balance sheet as the liquidity programs shrink at a faster rate than our purchase programs increase  on a related operational note  demand for borrowing treasury securities from our term securities lending facility has continued to decline with operations for both schedule 1 and 2 collateral consistently undersubscribed  tslf operations are very staffintensive so we are proposing to reduce the frequency of schedule 2
auctions from the biweekly schedule that was implemented during the market turmoil last fall back to the original weekly schedule  we plan to maintain the overall size of the tslf program for the present but will continue to assess whether changes may be appropriate in the future  ill now turn it over to bill nelson who will discuss the talf
chairman bernanke  trish does that proposal require any approval
ms mosser  it does not according to the authorizationbut ill bow to debbie for
greater wisdom on that
mr fisher  mr chairman may i ask just one question on exhibit 17
chairman bernanke  surely
mr fisher  this is calendar year 2009
ms mosser  yes correct
mr nelson  as trish noted the subscription for the first talf operation begins today  the loans requested between now and thursday will settle on march 25 exactly four months after we first announced the program  those months were spent canvassing potential abs issuers and investors to determine the program design characteristics that would be most successful evaluating the risks of the program and developing the associated controls and working out the backoffice arrangements
nevertheless the size of the initial talf subscription is going to be modest in part because potential borrowers are uneasy using the talf to finance abs purchases  potential borrowers and primary dealers have largely been unable to work out mutually acceptable customer arrangements  a particular sticking point seems to be assigning responsibility for the risk that a potential borrower is determined to be ineligible for the program at the eleventh hour leaving the primary dealer who is typically the underwriter responsible for funding the issue  investors are also reportedly concerned that participation in the program will expose them to government interference in their business a fear apparently confirmed on friday when it became more widely understood that recipients of 133 loans will be subject to tighter restrictions when hiring noncitizens  we are trying to facilitate agreements between potential borrowers and primary dealers we are seeking to provide as much clarity as possible on the issue of hiring noncitizens and we are addressing other issues as they arise  we continue to hope that participants will grow more comfortable with the program over time  i note that revisions to the faqs to help clarify some issues are going on right now
the subscription that starts today is for the talf program as initially announced
the new york fed will be extending threeyear nonrecourse loans against newly
issued triplearated auto credit card and student loan abs and abs guaranteed by the small business administration  the monthly operations will continue through this december unless extended by the board  the program has a 200 billion ceiling and is supported by 20 billion in credit protection from the treasury
as you all know the board is prepared to consider increasing the size of the program up to 1 trillion supported by up to 100 billion in credit protection from the treasury  the expansion would entail widening the list of eligible collateral to encompass much of the universe of newly issued triplearated collateralized obligations for the most part backed by newly and recently issued loans  staff at the board new york fed chicago fed atlanta fed and the treasury have been evaluating specific asset classes for possible inclusion in the program and have been developing prospective terms and conditions  we are concentrating first on the largest asset classes and will recommend specific categories of securities for inclusion on a flow basis as we complete our reviews
as a first step in that expansion we recommend that the board approve adding four categories of abs to the list of eligible collateral starting with the april operation  the four categories are the first to be recommended because they have relatively straightforward structures similar to those already taken allowing us to evaluate them quickly  although they are smaller asset classes than the consumer abs already accepted they are the largest among the securities that can be evaluated quickly
the first three are the principal types of abs that were excluded from the initial program because they are not backed by consumer loans  abs backed by loans or leases relating to business equipment abs backed by leases of vehicle fleets and abs backed by revolving lines of credit used to finance showroom inventories  the fourth is abs backed by the credit provided by residential mortgage servicers when homeowners miss payments  mortgage servicers have found credit increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain  accepting the abs at the talf should improve the servicers ability to work with homeowners to prevent avoidable foreclosures
all the assets proposed to be accepted will have maturities of three years or less resulting in a good fit for the threeyear term of the talf loans  the proposed new collateral classes are of roughly equivalent risk to the types already accepted  after applying the recommended haircuts which range from 8 to 13 percent the risk to the federal reserve should be similar to the de minimis risk associated with the types of abs already accepted as talf collateral  we estimate that accepting the new categories of abs would increase demand for talf loans through december by
30 billion to 130 billion  if the board approves the additions we would release revised terms and conditions and faqs for the program on thursday
we are also evaluating the other remaining major collateralized asset classes for inclusion under the talf for example cmbs and nonagency rmbs  subject to board approval terms and conditions for these asset classes could be announced as
early as midapril  staff members have held extensive discussions with issuers investors and rating agencies about several asset categories and have narrowed down the scope of securities that we might recommend accepting  for instance cmbs would likely include those backed by solidly underwritten existing mortgages and by mortgages that are being refinanced and rmbs would likely include those backed by mortgages exceeding the conforming loan limit and possibly mortgages to nearprime borrowers  because a number of the assets envisioned for the expansion are more complicated than those currently taken or thus far proposed to be taken at the talf staff members are planning to recommend that a collateral agent be hired to assist with underwriting and that a portfolio manager be hired to monitor the assets accepted
staff members are also evaluating the use of the talf to address the legacy asset problem  the treasury has proposed that the federal reserve accept at the talf older securities that were rated triplea when issued but that may or may not still be rated triplea  one reason to expand the talf to legacy assets would be to increase demand for and hence the prices of the eligible assets thereby bolstering the balance sheets of financial institutions  another reason would be to remove the eligible assets from the balance sheets of their current holders leaving those firms with cleaner more transparent balance sheets and an improved capacity to attract new equity from private sources  in the treasurys proposed structure the legacy talf loans have fiveyear terms but in other ways the facility resembles the existing talf
staff members have analyzed the feasibility of the legacy talf proposal for a few asset classes specifically 2005 to 2008vintage cmbs still rated triplea and subprime and alta rmbs rated triplea at origination  our preliminary assessment is that for many of these securities haircuts and other terms could be set that would adequately protect the federal reserve and the treasury but would nevertheless elicit sufficient investor demand to be helpful  we have concluded though that it would be necessary in some cases to set haircuts on a securitybysecurity basis
nevertheless we believe that we could operate the program at sufficient scale and with sufficient speed by hiring an outside contractor
joe gagnon and dave reifschneider will now discuss largescale asset purchases
chairman bernanke  before you start let me just say that ill give a briefing on
the treasurys plans and all of these issues after the presentations here
mr gagnon2   dave reifschneider and i will review the papers on largescale asset purchases lsaps that were sent to the committee last week  considerable evidence indicates that policyinduced changes in the supply of longterm bonds affect bond yields  as noted in the top panel of your first exhibit a memo circulated to the fomc last december reviewed the economic literature on this question and

2  materials used by messrs gagnon and reifschneider are appended to this document appendix 2
reported that a federal reserve purchase of 500 billion of longterm treasury securities could plausibly reduce the 10year treasury yield by 20 to 100 basis points such a purchase would also be expected to lower longterm private yields  generally speaking public and private longterm debt markets are closely linked and correlations of changes in yields across these markets have historically been very high  however in recent months these correlations have declined noticeably raising the possibility that spillovers across markets may currently be lower than normal
the middle panel presents evidence on the effects of recent central bank communications on bond yields  on november 25 the first column the federal reserve announced a program to purchase 600 billion of agency debt and agency mbs  on december 1 the second column chairman bernanke stated that the federal reserve was considering purchasing substantial quantities of longterm treasury securities  on december 16 the fomc stated that it stood ready to expand its purchases of agency securities and confirmed that it was considering largescale purchases of treasuries  on each of these occasions the 10year treasury yield and longterm private yields fell substantially  on january 28 the fomc did not indicate any change in its stance toward purchasing longterm treasuries whereas market participants reportedly attributed a significant probability to such a move  longterm yields rose markedly  none of these moves appears to be attributable to economic news  as trish mentioned on march 5 the bank of england announced that it plans to purchase 75 billion of mainly longterm sterling treasury securities  the final column shows that a range of public and private longterm yields fell sharply after the bank of englands announcement
household mortgage rates are quite a bit stickier than yields on traded securities which makes them unsuitable for inclusion in the table  however as shown in the bottom panel most of the decline in treasury yields since midnovember the red line has passed through to conforming 30year mortgage rates the black line  ill now turn the presentation over to dave
mr reifschneider  the top panel of your next exhibit reviews the basic channels through which buying agency mbs or longterm treasury securities potentially influences the real economy  the primary mechanism is through a broad improvement in financial conditions  as joe discussed such purchases reduce yields on the targeted securities  in addition the evidence suggests that these reductions spill over to yields on corporate bonds and other longterm instruments if so these interest rate movements should spark higher equity prices and a lower real exchange rate  in turn household spending business investment and net exports should strengthen in response to lower borrowing costs higher wealth and greater international price competitiveness
as illustrated in the middle panel the stimulus from an lsap program hinges on the extent of financial spillover  the table shows a sequence of predictions from the frbus model for the response of real gdp to purchasing a further 500 billion in agency mbs assuming successively greater spillovers  as shown in line 1 even
though the program is assumed to lower mbs yields and mortgage rates by 75 basis points the boost to the level of real gdp would be small in the absence of any spillover to other financial markets  but if as in line 2 the fall in mbs yields leads to lower corporate bond yields and other interest rates the boost to the level of real gdp climbs to  percent by 2011  expanding the spillovers yet further to the stock market line 3 and the real exchange rate line 4 more than doubles the amount of stimulus to roughly 1 percent by 2011
other simulations not shown here suggest that the stimulus provided by purchases of longterm treasury securities also is highly sensitive to the extent of financial spillover  but if such purchases were to reduce the general level of interest rates boost equity prices and lower the dollar then the resultant stimulus to real activity would be only modestly lower than that provided by an mbsonly program as indicated in the memo line of the table
as noted in the bottom left panel these frbus simulations do not capture all the potential ways in which an lsap program could stimulate real activity  for example lower mortgage rates could boost home prices thereby stimulating household wealth and spending  theoretical calculations suggest that a percentage point decline in interest rates could boost house prices as much as 15 percent however empirical estimates suggest that the increase might be closer to 2 percent  in addition lower interest rates might via mortgage refinancing transfer income to cashstrapped borrowers from more affluent households who are net lenders  calculations suggest that such income transfers could provide a modest boost to consumption  as indicated by the red line in the figure to the right when refi effects and 2 percent higher house prices are incorporated into the frbus simulations the stimulus from a 1 trillion lsap programevenly divided between treasuries and mbsrises noticeably  effects are larger yet if house prices increase by the theoretical 15  percent the green line
turning to your next exhibit these results imply that asset purchases have the potential to compensate for the inability of conventional monetary policy to ease further  as noted to the left the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will remain essentially at the zero bound for several years as illustrated by the black line to the right  but unconstrained optimal monetary policy would call for the fed funds rate to fall even lower were that possible the red line  to overcome this shortfall in conventional monetary policy would require additional fiscal and unconventional monetary actions
the middle panels illustrate how the greenbook outlook for unemployment and inflation might change if the committee opted to expand the current program of buying agency debt and mbs by either 500 billion the red line or 1 trillion the green line  under the smaller program all the additional purchases are mbs under the larger program purchases are evenly divided between mbs and longterm treasury securities  both programs are assumed to generate a full range of financial spillovers but no boost to home prices or any increase in consumption from
refirelated income transfers in addition monetary policy in both cases is set optimally subject to the zero lower bound constraint  as shown to the left both programs limit the rise in the unemployment rate and cause it to fall more quickly than in the baseline the black line  all told the larger program fills roughly half of the gap between the staff forecast and what hypothetically would occur under unconstrained monetary policy the blue line  as shown to the right both programs would also mitigate the fall in inflation that is projected in the baseline
the bullet points at the bottom offer a few caveats to this analysis  first these results depend importantly on extensive financial spillover effects unfortunately empirical evidence on the size of stock market and exchange rate effects is slim
second gauging the economic effects of further asset purchases is quite difficult under current conditions even if extensive financial spillovers do occur  in particular households and firms may be reluctant to increase spending in the face of so much uncertainty and credit constraints may limit their ability to respond to improved financial conditions alternatively cashstrapped households may be more responsive than normal to any boost to income provided by an lsap program
finally the effectiveness of an lsap program in stopping an unwelcome disinflation might be greater than the simulations indicate if largescale asset purchases directly bolster the feds credibility  ill now turn the presentation back to joe
mr gagnon  exhibit 4 presents some risks that might arise from expanding lsap programs  the most important risk which is covered in the upper panel is whether large asset holdings might threaten the federal reserves ability in the future to achieve its monetary policy objectives  spence hilton will be discussing this issue in the context of the overall balance sheet of the federal reserve and brian madigan will discuss potential new policy tools to ameliorate this risk  largescale holdings of marketable assets are not likely to constrain the federal reserves policy stance in the future  with shortterm interest rates pinned at the zero bound asset purchases provide macroeconomic stimulus and asset sales provide macroeconomic restraint
if it were deemed necessary to raise shortterm interest rates and holdings of long term assets appeared to conflict with this goal these assets could be sold off or potentially used as collateral for reservedraining shortterm operations  however outright sales of longterm assets could lead to a financial loss and some of the tools that could be used to drain reserves without engaging in outright sales are still under development
moving to the lower panel even though fiscal revenue is not an objective of monetary policy it may be of interest to note that lsaps are significantly increasing the income generated by the federal reserve  this is because the interest rate earned on longterm assets is much greater than the marginal interest rate paid on liabilities however by increasing the leverage and maturity mismatch of the federal reserves balance sheet lsaps increase the volatility of future income
your final exhibit discusses strategies for pursuing lsaps  the upper panel reviews three classes of longterm security that the federal reserve is authorized to
purchase  treasuries agency debt and agency mbs  as dave discussed under current market conditions we believe that mbs purchases provide a somewhat greater macroeconomic stimulus than equivalent purchases of the other two classes this primarily reflects our view that mbs purchases will reduce private interest rates more than an equivalent volume of treasury purchases  however in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding our estimates of the spillover effects across asset markets including a significant share of treasury securities and a modest share of agency debt in any expansion of federal reserve purchases may be a prudent strategy
the lower left panel shows that the spread of mortgage rates over mbs yields rose in december with the surge of refinancing applications  these two series have been highly correlated in the past  the staff projects that current low mortgage rates and the administrations new making home affordable program are likely to create another more sustained surge in refinancing applications in coming weeks  as discussed in the panel to the right there are some potential actions the federal reserve could take to hold down the spread of mortgage rates over mbs yields and thus enhance the macroeconomic impact of its policies  these include focusing purchases on newproduction mbs to support new loans rather than seasoned loans another possibility if it were determined to be consistent with the federal reserves statutory authority is selling put options on forward mbs to help mortgage originators hedge the uncertainty of their application pipelines  perhaps even more unconventionally the federal reserve could provide some assurance through its communications to the market that low mortgage rates are likely to persist for several months or more  this might reduce volatility in rates and thus reduce originator hedging costs  it might also ease the crush of homeowners trying to refinance at the same time which strains the currently reduced capacity of mortgage originators and puts upward pressure on mortgage rates  thank you  nathan sheets will now discuss foreign currency liquidity swaps
mr sheets  the staff recommends that the fomc establish swap lines with major foreign central banks that would allow the federal reserve to backstop the foreign currency funding needs of us institutions operating abroad  these lines would give the federal reserve the same capacity to act as a lender of last resort that our existing dollar swap lines provide foreign central banks
this proposal involves two components  first the fomc would create a new set of swap lines with foreign central banks  these new swap lines would be designed to provide the federal reserve access to foreign currency liquidity  we suggest establishing such lines with the bank of england the european central bank the bank of japan and the swiss national bank  we envision that the lines with the boj and ecb would be set at roughly 100 billion equivalent and the lines with the boe and the snb would be a little less than half as large  these central banks have indicated that they are open to establishing such lines with us
second the fomc would need to create a mechanism to transfer the foreign currency received in the swap with the foreign central bank to a us financial institution  we propose that you authorize use of the system open market account  to conduct swap transactions for this purpose  this transaction would be structured as follows  an institution that was facing severe foreign currency funding pressures would approach its federal reserve bank  the reserve bank would then assess the financial position of the institution and the extent of the foreign currency funding need  if in the reserve banks judgment a swap was appropriate the reserve bank would initiate a request with the foreign currency subcommittee which would have delegated authority to approve swap draws  requests for rollovers would also be initiated through the reserve bank  the federal reserve would swap foreign currency to a us institution in exchange for dollars  the federal reserve would charge the institution a fee which would be equal to the foreign central banks policy target plus an additional charge and would also take a 3 to 5 percent security deposit in cash  this deposit would protect against a scenario in which an institution failed to unwind the swap and in which the dollars that were received in the swap proved insufficient to extinguish our foreign currency obligation to the foreign central bank we anticipate that such swaps would be conducted at very short tenors primarily overnight through one week
while we would expect a us institution that faced difficulties obtaining sufficient foreign currency funding in a market abroad to turn first to the foreign central bank we see three scenarios in which that option might not be available first an institution might have insufficient collateral at the foreign central bank to meet the drain on its funding and be unable to mobilize sufficient resources on its own perhaps because the us payment system was closed or because the institution was experiencing broader funding pressures  second the foreign central bank might choose not to lend to an institution even in the presence of acceptable collateral this might reflect concerns about the institutions underlying financial condition or political pressures  third the federal reserve might wish to provide foreign currency funding as part of an effort presumably coordinated with other us authorities to prevent a disorderly unwinding of an insolvent institutions balance sheet  such lending of course would be done in a manner consistent with the constraints of fdicia and other legal protocols
as i noted at the january meeting one major us institution has shown particular vulnerabilities regarding its foreign currency funding but we cannot rule out scenarios in which other large us institutions might run into similar trouble  there is a related risk that once one us institution shows vulnerability in this regard other
us institutions might also then be viewed as vulnerable and that a broader foreign currency liquidity squeeze could develop  in our view roughly half a dozen major
us institutions have sufficient foreign operations to be vulnerable in this respect
these observations suggest that it would be prudent for the federal reserve to have the capacity to backstop the foreign currency funding needs of us institutions establishing temporary swap lines with foreign central banks strikes us as a
straightforward way to do this  while there is a good possibility that these lines would never actually be drawn on they nevertheless would provide valuable insurance against the risk of severe stress
one important issue that we have grappled with is whether the transaction with a
us financial institution should be structured as a swap using soma or as a foreign currency denominated loan from the discount window  after considerable deliberation and reflection we were persuaded that the backtoback swap structure is the way to go  the federal reserve traditionally conducts its foreign currency transactions out of soma and there is no precedent for discount window lending in foreign currencies  a key complication with the discount window approach is getting the foreign currency from soma to the appropriate reserve bank since only the federal reserve bank of new york has accounts at foreign central banks  in addition systems to record and manage discount window operations were not designed to track loans in foreign currencies
by putting these swap lines in place we would signal our intention to pursue best practice in homehost relations  we would be prepared to provide liquidity support to a us institution if the foreign central bank were reluctant to step in  this could also give us increased negotiating leverage to expect foreign central banks to provide similar support to their institutions operating in the united states
what risks do these transactions pose to the federal reserve  the risks attending the swap with the foreign central bank would be nil  as with our dollar liquidity swaps there is no exchange rate or interest rate risk because these parameters are specified upfront  and the foreign central bank is required to deposit the dollars it receives in the swap at the federal reserve bank of new york so there is no credit risk  as for the transaction with the us financial institution the federal reserve is protected first by the short tenor of the transaction  second the dollar holdings received in the swap could be used to acquire foreign currency if the institution fails to unwind the transaction  third if these dollars prove inadequate to repay the foreign central bank fullyeither because the dollar has depreciated or because of transactions coststhe federal reserve will draw on the cash security deposit that  the institution has provided  all told we judge that federal reserve resources would be well protected against any financial risks  we also note the possibility of moral hazardinstitutions may come to depend on the federal reserve to meet their  foreign currency funding needs rather than arranging for sufficient funding in the market or mobilizing their collateral for use at a foreign central bank  however we have structured these swaps to minimize this risk to the extent possible  in particular the size of the fee and the cash deposit should help ensure that the swaps are attractive only as a last resort
establishing these foreign currency swap lines requires fomc approvaleither directly or through delegation to the subcommittee  we envision that approval by the full committee would be followed by a press release within 10 days or so and in any event would be reported in the minutes  as such the establishment of these lines
would quickly become public knowledge  while the staff had previously feared that a public announcement could generate a negative reaction from the markets the current weakness of confidence toward the banks may diminish this concern  indeed an announcement that this backstop had been put in place could even enhance confidence
if in the committees judgment the announcement effects associated with these facilities would be manageable then you could authorize these foreign currency swap lines at the meeting today  however if you remain concerned about negative announcement effects then we recommend that the committee delegate authority to the foreign currency subcommittee to approve these swap lines  this would enable the announcement to be deferred pending a time when draws on the lines would actually be made  there might still be some announcement effects created by reports of an fomc vote to delegate this authority to the subcommittee but it would probably not be seen as signaling the same urgency as an announcement that the facilities themselves had been established  the authority granted to the subcommittee in this regard would be symmetric to that already delegated to the subcommittee to negotiate dollar liquidity swap lines
i conclude by noting that the bank of mexico has recently expressed interest in drawing on its dollar swap line with the federal reserve  we are currently working with our mexican counterparts to better understand the situation in their economy and how they would use the dollars  these discussions are ongoing and we will keep you posted as they proceed  spence hilton will now continue our presentation
mr hilton3   thank you  im going to review major changes on the federal reserve balance sheet since the last fomc meeting and then summarize some longrun balance sheet analysis that was in the memo distributed last week  last
week the markets group distributed its first comprehensive report on developments at the various lending facilities and purchase programs over the past intermeeting period with a discussion of related financial market developments  that report offers much more detail than i will provide in my remarks
just ahead of the last fomc meeting in late january the total size of the balance sheet was 204 trillion a bit off levels reached just ahead of the yearend  as shown in exhibit 2 over the course of that last week in january which included the fomc meeting dates assets fell almost 200 billion  declines were widespread among the various shortterm lending facilities with the steepest dropoffs in total draws on the swap lines used to fund dollar lending by foreign central banks and in the commercial paper funding facility  as shown in exhibit 3 for the past several months now interest rates on alternative market sources of financing available to many borrowers have been below the rates on the facilities themselves  ongoing deleveraging of balance sheets has been cited as a factor contributing to reduced borrowing

3  materials used by mr hilton are appended to this document appendix 3
as shown in exhibits 4 through 9 on the following two pages since early february lending through many of the shortterm liquidity facilities has declined further to one degree or another  still these facilities remain a crucial source of funding for some borrowers despite rate quotes that suggest cheaper market sources of funding  a notable exception to the general trend is the term auction facility shown in exhibit 7  the volume of propositions at the taf auctions at the minimum bid rate of 25 basis points has increased some in recent weeks although total propositions have remained below the total offering amounts
as trish noted purchases of agency mbs and agency debt have been steadily rising  purchases of agency mbs show up in a very lumpy way on the balance sheet because of market practice to concentrate settlements on select dates often with a considerable lag  last thursday alone the size of the balance sheet jumped as about
160 billion of purchase commitments settled which now leaves the total balance sheet about unchanged from its level just ahead of the last fomc meeting
in coming weeks we anticipate that recent patterns in different components of the balance sheet will continue  there is potential for increased lending through some of the shortterm liquidity facilities ahead of the march quarterend date as a possible stress point  but apart from the aforementioned increase in taf auctions we have not seen this so far  meanwhile our outright purchase programs are set to proceed on a steady upward path
turning to longerterm prospects for the balance sheet the memo distributed last week presents illustrative forecasts of the balance sheet out to 2016  projections were constructed based on certain economic assumptions varying degrees of financial stress assumed over the next couple of years and on policy assumptions motivated by the economic and financial conditions
for simplicity in estimation the various liquidity facilities purchase programs and other balance sheet initiatives are grouped into just a handful of broad asset categories  a baseline scenario was developed using economic conditions similar to those of the march greenbook and an optimistic scenario and a stress scenario were built around this case
the methodology was kept very simple given the obvious uncertainties  but the broad contours of the asset projections are thought to be illustrative of different orders of magnitude for the size of the balance sheet that could be realized under several plausible sets of assumptions
projections for the balance sheet and the asset components for each of the three scenarios are shown in exhibits 1012  in the stress case shown in the bottom panel solid growth only takes hold in 2011 another financial market stress period is assumed to occur later this year and there is a significant total expansion in outright
purchase programs  in this case the balance sheet peaks at 46 trillion in 2010 although most of the growth occurs this year
in the outyears2011 and beyondin all scenarios we assume a natural runoff of assets  shortterm lending at liquidity facilities dissipates relatively quickly  talf loans mature on schedule  and the gradual declines in outright holdings reflect either maturities or prepayments of agency mortgagebacked securities
on the liability side of the balance sheet apart from some assumed nominal growth in federal reserve note liabilities the offset to asset movements is the level of reserve balances held by depository institutions  the reserve estimates can provide a sense of the possible size of any need either to drain reserves or to increase reserve demand should the federal reserve wish to target shortterm interest ratesthe federal funds rateusing conventional operating procedures that are typically associated with keeping excess reserve levels near zero
exhibit 13 shows reserve levels for all three scenarios  peak reserve levels reach
37 trillion in 2010 in the stress scenario  while it is unlikely that a return to a positive interest rate target would coincide with when reserve levels were at their maximum that occasion could come unexpectedly quickly nonetheless  the memo concludes by presenting the various options available to the federal reserve for accomplishing this
from october to december 2008 excess reserves were left high and market rates were considerably below the interest rate paid on excess reserves  there are good reasons to believe that experience may not represent the normal relation between market rates and the rate of interest paid on excess reserves  nonetheless policymakers might be uncomfortable at this point adopting a framework to control market rates by setting the interest rate paid on excess reserves alone while leaving excess reserves at high levels
the treasurys supplementary financing program or authority for the federal reserve to issue its own debt would provide considerable capacity to drain reserves and little additional operational infrastructure would be needed  traditional monetary policy tools sales of assets and reverse rps could be developed to support reserve draining operations on a much larger scale than ever used in the past  these could take some time to develop to their full potential and there is some question about the scale on which these tools could be deployed
finally the broad authority to pay interest on reserves that the federal reserve now has could be utilized in other ways to shape demand for reserves so as to effectively reduce excess reserves to levels that would allow the fed to target positive shortterm interest rates within a more conventional operating framework  here too some period of time would be needed to develop an effective operating framework using interestonreserves authority  now ill turn it over to brian to conclude
mr madigan  as spence hilton noted it could be very useful to have an additional tool for draining substantial volumes of reserves from the banking system and shrinking the monetary base  either the issuance of fed bills or an enhanced supplementary financing program run by the treasury on behalf of the federal reserve could be particularly helpful  the staff has drafted legislative language that would authorize these tools  because the treasury would have a substantial interest in such programs and because we would need the treasurys support in advancing such legislation we have been discussing this subject with the treasury  our presumption is that we would not seek legislation both for fed bills and for an enhanced sfp  rather we and the treasury together would raise both possibilities with the relevant congressional committees to discuss the substance and the political prospects for each  on the basis of those discussions one approach or the other would be advanced
to give adequate assurance to the federal reserve and to the markets that these tools will provide the capability to tighten monetary policy as necessary and when necessary the tools would have to be effectively under the federal reserves control two possible constraints are of particular concern  the public debt ceiling and possible interference by a future treasury  to ensure that a binding debt ceiling does not disrupt the conduct of monetary policy fed bills or treasury bills issued under an enhanced sfp program would have to be excluded from the debt ceiling  and to ensure that a future treasury could not block the implementation of appropriate monetary policy the federal reserve either will need to be able to issue its own obligations as it sees fit to carry out its statutory mandate or it will need to be able to direct the treasury to do so as its proxy
however the congress may see the exclusion of fed bills or sfp obligations from the debt ceiling as an unwarranted dilution of the congressional responsibility to appropriate government monies and to authorize the issuance of federal debt  and we recognize that the treasury is concerned about the potential for issuance of such securities to interfere with the treasurys responsibility for managing the public debt
draft legislation prepared by the staff would assign the primary responsibility within the federal reserve for the issuance of fed bills or sfp bills to the federal open market committee  this seems appropriate because the main purpose of the tool as we see it is to ensure the capability of the fomc to tighten monetary policy when appropriate  we see fed bills as a tool on the liabilities side of the federal reserves balance sheet that would essentially be symmetric with our assetside open market operations
the legislation should also address several other key issues  in that regard we have included the following specific elements in the draft legislation we sent to the treasury
 first fed bills would be full faith and credit obligations of the united states in order to maximize their acceptability to investors to make them as close
substitutes as possible for treasury securities and to minimize the interest expense of such obligations
 second for similar reasons fed bills should not be subject to state and local income taxes
 third the treasury has suggested a statutory maximum maturity of fed bills in order to limit interference with treasury debt management  we have recommended a maximum maturity of one year  treasury staff members prefer a shorter maximum term
 finally we have recommended that the fed not be required to notify the treasury a fixed number of days before issuing fed bills or scheduling issuance of sfp bills but rather that the legislation indicate qualitatively that issuance of fed bills or sfp bills should minimize interference with the conduct of the treasurys regular debt management responsibilities
as president plosser and others have noted there are pros and cons to the fed bills and expanded sfp proposals  and even with the support of the administration the political prospects for such legislation are not clear at this stage  it is possible that the federal reserve may need to accept some changes to the draft legislation to obtain passage  one possible change that might help make the program acceptable to all interested parties would be a sunset provision under which the authority to issue such obligations expires after say five years
chairman bernanke  thank you for a very thorough set of reports  out of those
reports there was i believe one action item well come back tobesides ratifying the open
market operationswhich is the swap proposal that nathan discussed  but lets open now for
questions to any of the staff  president fisher
mr fisher  if i can go back to the beginning or almost the beginning and ask some
questions about the talf in terms of lessons learnedi understand that barclays has put
together a passthrough certificate program that seems to have some acceptance at least in the
hedge fund community  could you bring us up to date on that and what it means in terms of the
functioning of the talf  does it facilitate it  does it make it more complicated  did you
expect it  and is it something thats going forward
mr nelson  ill do the best i can  first of all this is something that weve been
allowing the private sector to develop  its not like some of these other instances where weve
worked with the private sector to develop special purpose vehicles like the mmiff  these are
private sector efforts  these things first came up in discussions when we were trying to think of
ways to make the program useful for real money investors  part of the challenge in the talf is
that the objective is to encourage an investor class that normally hasnt invested in assetbacked
securities to move into that space namely leveraged investors  traditionally assetbacked
securities have been held by real money investors like pension funds and insurance companies
so we were trying to think of ways that the program could be made more attractive for those
investors  one way to do that would be to have a special purpose vehicle purchase the asset
backed securities and take the loan and raise the haircut part of that transaction by issuing equity
that equity could conceivably be a tradable security which could be invested in by real money
investors
when we looked at that a month or so ago it didnt necessarily seem as if it was going to
be successful though my understanding is that it has gotten more momentum in recent weeks  in
particular the one thing that i think would really make it take off would be if those equity
tranches could be rated by the credit rating agencies and i am not sure where that effort stands
another reason these special purpose vehicles came up was our requirement that we only
lend to us entities  many hedge funds are actually foreign entities but we viewed it as
acceptable and i may not get this exactly right if there was a us arm of that entity with a us
operationan actual person a manager therethat would be a us entity that we could lend to
so to some extent there was an effort to set up vehicles along those lines  then lastly there has
been interest in potentially insulating the financial institution from some things like the h1b
visa issue that i just mentioned or some other consequences of the program itself  i dont think
any of these things are likely to be moving forward for this subscription but rather they are
continuing to be reviewed by the private sector and being developed
mr fisher  but just so i understand this lets assume that this proceeds  i perceive it
as having significant momentum in the investment community  the spvs would be performing
basically a clearing function  they create a cusipidentified tradable security  the people that
could buy those securities would not have to worry about all the ramifications of the tarp in
terms of the political ramifications that seem to be spooking the hedge fund and other
communitiesis that correct
mr nelson  well its not clear and i think thats the rub right now  the folks that
are concerned about compliance i think have written our regulations to say we will look
through such structures to the ownership entity to make sure that the compliance protocols have
been followed  on the other hand when we say whom were actually lending to i think that
language has been more along the lines ofin particular say for whether or not its a us
entityits okay to set up one of these entities  and because those two efforts are not yet
completely lined up thats why i believe these things are still under development and there are
still open questions that need to be answered before its clear that they will be able to go forward
mr fisher  would you say that this search for new engineering is a function of the
discomfort of the hedge fund community and the investment community with the talf given
the tarp restrictions that are placed on top  im just trying to understand where this came
from
mr nelson  i think it came up for several of these reasons  thats certainly one of
them
mr fisher  but i can see where this could also certainly be suspicious politically
im just trying to understand how this talf thing is going to unfold because there seems to be
some momentum in this direction at least from the standpoint of simpson thacher who are the
lawyers behind it  forget about the dealer relationship to the fedits between the dealers and
the investment community where theres still this odd linkage here  its becoming increasingly
complicated
vice chairman dudley  in terms of the order i think the spv was initially a
device so that real money investors could get involved in the talf  but then as all the political
considerations became more severe over the last couple of weeks people thought well hey we
could also use it for this second purposeto provide some distance from the government and the
tarp restrictions  but the original impetus was for real money accounts
mr fisher  one of the reasons im raising it is that i think weve got to be careful not
to get the cart before the horse here and in the presentation i realized just looking down the
path were talking about legacy assets  were going to have to get the first setup correct before
we go further down the path  at least i would recommend that to the committee
mr nelson  yes and we have remained very focused on that
chairman bernanke  thats very good advice  president hoenig
mr hoenig  just a clarifying question  can you quickly give me a matrix that says
what talf issuance were talking about and how much starting with the original 200 billion
and then the various addons up to the totaljust so i understand what were talking about in
each issuance or expansion of the talf program
mr nelson  at this time our estimate is that over the life of the program the
collateral that was approved initiallythats beginning today and thats consumer abs and
small business administration absthat should amount we think to 100 billion  so we
wont make it to 200 billion unless the program is expanded  the additional asset classes that
weve proposed to the board for inclusion which would largely complete the assetbacked
securities space as well as mortgage servicer advances would add another 30 billion  so those
combined would still not bring us to 200 billion  the rest of the analysis is really very
tentative  so our effort is to be as inclusive as possible and were looking at the major
collateralized highquality asset classes
mr hoenig  this would go all the way to legacy commercialmortgagebacked
securities
mr nelson  no  at this point i was thinking in terms of newly issued securities
mr hoenig  newly issued  okay
mr nelson  the range that the teams have provided goes from 50 to 500 billion
depending on a number of issues including whether or not warehouse financing is available
whether or not investors can grow comfortable with the rather extreme mismatch between the
maturity of the talf loans and the maturity of the underlying securities  so that last step
conceivably would still not take us to the 1 trillion  but it is i must say very uncertain because
theyre still just scoping out those securities  now legacy assets would then add on to that
mr hoenig  thats helpful  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i have several questions and a comment at
the end  first a compliment to the new york staff  i thought that the material distributed ahead
of time outlining all of the asset programs was very informative very well laid out and very
succinct  my compliments to you on that work
i have a question for ms mosser  this has to do with the comparison between a program
of agency and mbs purchases like weve been pursuing and what a program of us treasury
purchases would look like  my understanding is that you plan your announcements and the size
of your purchases a little bit in advance  would we get any more flexibility by using treasuries
rather than mbs or are they pretty much the same  would you get a little more flexibility to
vary the size of the purchases week to week
ms mosser  its a different kind of flexibility  in the mortgagebacked securities
program although we do buy across the curve in all coupons we are focused very much on the
tba or the forward delivery market which trades weeks and months in advance of delivery  if
thats the market that youre trading and buying in you have a huge amount of flexibility from
day to day to respond to prices in that market and just to buy more forward contracts or fewer or
do a dollar roll and offset some of those if you have to  but then on delivery day you get as we
did last week 160 billion of securities  so in that sense of flexibilitycan you respond daily to
market events for example tighter spreads narrower spreadsits very easy to do  thats a
very deep liquid market its a very homogeneous market even though what you get delivered is
fairly heterogeneous  in the treasury market its a different kind of flexibility  we can buy in
various parts of the treasury curve  in the mortgage market its very hard to move around the
mortgage yield curve easily but its easy to do that in the treasury curve  so im not quite sure
what you mean by flexibility  if you mean sheer quantity theyre probably about the same
mr lacker  let me follow up  when you buy treasuries when you do a coupon
pass do you settle the same day or next day
ms mosser  next day
mr lacker  next day  these mbs and agency securitiesthey settle once a month
ms mosser  several times a month but yes  it depends on the type of security but
yes basically once a month
mr lacker  i see  so if i looked at it from the point of view of what happens to bank
reserves its just a onceamonth hit
ms mosser  well its once a month per type of security  so there are actually
several days a month
mr lacker  i see  so its staggered
ms mosser  but its very periodic and very very predictable when theyre going to
settle
mr lacker  right  for spence i was very interested in the forecast of the balance
sheet and weve been talking about that for the last couple of meetings  you have the forecast
going up in a straight line to the end of the year and i take it thats just because you forecasted
the endofyear balance sheet right
mr hilton  yes
mr lacker  do you have a sense of what its going to do between now and the next
meeting  have you done that exercise
mr hilton  not really systematically in the way this is put together  our sense
though between now and the next meeting is that what were going to be buying is fairly
predictable  im not sure what the settlement dates are but if the settlement dates were smooth
we would be expanding pretty much at the same pace  id expect the liquidity facilities though
to hang out where they are and maybe on balance come off a little bit further barring some sort
of a stress period  so i would anticipate that were predominantly in an expansion phase right
now
mr lacker  so in principle if i asked you to write down numerically as you did for
the end of the year a forecast for the monetary base at the next meeting say you could do that
mr hilton  yeahwith a nice confidence interval
mr lacker  subject to the usual caveats  laughter  a question for mr nelson
you named a bunch of asset categories that youre considering for the talf  what criteria are
you using to pick those asset classes  i mean what sort of principle or objective is driving those
choices
mr nelson our objective is to take as broad a set of assets as possible consistent
with choosing ones that can be taken efficiently that we can figure out ways to take with
acceptable risk to the federal reserve system and to the government
mr lacker  but just abs right
mr nelson  well all collateralized assets
mr lacker  oh collateralized assets  okay
mr nelson  but of relatively simple straightforward structures so that we can
manage and understand the riskbut nevertheless as wide a group as possible  were just on
the way to that at this stage
mr lacker  okay  im just curious  its sort of striking  the original impetus
involved certain securitization markets where i thought we were motivated by particular
observations that suggested distress  are the problems we see in markets widespread across
securitization
chairman bernanke  separate from conforming mortgage markets where we
have a different program all other abs markets to my knowledge are pretty much shut down
mr lacker  and then a question for mr sheets  you talked about moral hazard
this institution that you talked aboutor any institution in this categorypresumably has
overseas operations in which they have liquid liabilities and less liquid assets
mr sheets  correct
mr lacker  and i think we talked about this at the last meeting right  thats where
you first briefed us on this
mr sheets  right
mr lacker  so over that periodits been almost two months nowcould an
institution like that have reduced its vulnerability to the possibility of having a funding problem
in another currency  could it have let its deposits run off maybe sell the assets upstream to the
parent  and if thats true then wouldnt the presence of this program influence an institutions
incentives to take steps in the weeks ahead to protect against potential funding problems
mr sheets  thats obviously a profoundly important question and let me just address
it at several different levels  in terms of the specifics of that particular institution one of the
things thats been a challenge for us is to get good datafor a range of such institutions  so its
hard to state categorically what this institution or other institutions have done with their balance
sheets over the last couple of months
but i do think its very telling that in midfebruary the stresses on the financial sector
and the banks were if anything even more pronounced than they were in midjanuary  yet we
didnt hear the same kinds of reports and we didnt observe the same stresses as in january
which may very well point to exactly the phenomenon that youre indicating herethat the
institution did things to reduce its vulnerability to these sorts of pressures  so i think that is
going on absolutely
that raises the question of whether this sort of a facility would dull those sorts of
incentives  as i said in my remarks weve done everything we possibly can to structure this in
such a way that it would be attractive to an institution only as a very last resortthe fees that
were charging the additional collateral and so on and so forth  nevertheless we can imagine
instances where the drain on the foreign currency funding might be very intense and even a
wellmanaged institution might have problems raising sufficient collateral and resources on its
own  we can also imagine instances where the foreign central bank is not enthusiastic about
lending against even good collateral for an institution  the bank of japan in particular
remembers an instance from the late 90s when the federal reserve was not enthusiastic about
lending to japanese institutions because of what were perceived as political pressures in the
united states and theyve asked us to consider the possibility that something similar might
happen to them and they wouldnt be able to lend to us institutions  so notwithstanding the
moral hazard risk which as i said weve done everything we can in this proposal to attenuate
we still see that there would be plausible states of nature where it would be prudent to have these
foreign currency swap lines in place
mr lacker  if i could just follow up mr chairman i take it that the institutions the
half dozen you referred to are bank holding companies in the united states
mr sheets  yes
mr lacker  what steps have we takenparticularly regarding the one you referred
to as being especially vulnerableto encourage them to reduce their vulnerability to funding
risks in foreign currencies
mr sheets  i would have to defer to the regulators  i dont know if trish has some
information
ms mosser  i also would defer to the supervisors on this  but we have had
conversations with the supervisory teams of a couple of these institutions not just the one since
we decided that it was worth investigating and nearly all of them are deleveraging abroad as
they are deleveraging here and attempting to reduce their liquidity risk  i think that eliminating
that risk in a really short period of time is probably unrealistic considering the size and scope of
operations including very traditional banking operationswhich we all know are subject to
runsthat several of these institutions have in many countries  and many of those countries do
not have for example the deposit insurance schemes that the united states does which means
the institutions are more vulnerable there  i think the possibility of completely shutting down
and eliminating the risk in a short period of time is probably unrealistic although movement in
that direction is a good idea
mr lacker  is it our sense that theyre doing all they could
ms mosser  my impression is that they are moving in that direction  i wouldnt
superimpose my views over the supervisors about whether theyre doing everything they can
ms bailey  im not quite sure how to frame all they can  i think the supervisors
particularly with the company thats probably the most international of allhave clearly gone
through their funding  it has set up appropriate funding mechanisms within those countries
where they are being looked at and they have taken good significant steps to try to address some
of the vulnerabilities  theyve had outreach meetings with the different central banks  so
during the last year they have actually been taking a lot of aggressive steps to try to minimize
the vulnerability associated with that  but some of the organizations are big purchasers in
foreign currencies  we just cant shut that down that quickly nor do we expect to  its just not a
believable strategy for that funding mechanism  but theyre looking more broadly both at the
us and abroad
mr lacker  i guess im looking not for shutting them down but for measures that
could reduce the funding vulnerability the liabilityasset mismatch that gives rise to the risk
ms bailey  they absolutely have been not only looking at those strategies but also
executing those strategies
mr lacker  thank you  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  a procedural question  we had seven
presentations  are we just going to do questions for now  are we going to have an opportunity
to do a sort of goaround
chairman bernanke  there will be a discussion period as well  this is just for
questions
mr plosser  i just wanted to go by the rules  on the largescale asset purchases i
have a couple of questions about some of the underlying assumptions  i was struck by the fact
that the assumption was that under an mbs purchase of 500 billion the rates on corporates and
treasuries also go down  but the net effect of that given the assumptions you made was that
corporate spreads rise by 20 basis points whereas under a treasury bill purchase corporate
spreads fall by 20 basis points  im puzzled about what model generates that kind of differential
effect and how much that might be driving some of the stimulation results that youve got  im
a little puzzled about what driveswell i know what drives it the numbers you put down drove
itbut i didnt know whether you thought that was internally consistent or whether there were
economic mechanisms that you thought that was consistent with
the second question i had was about the assumptions about the elasticities  youve got a
mortgagebacked security market thats 7 or 8 trillion somewhere in that neighborhood
youve got a 500 billion purchaseso thats a little less than 10 percent of the marketplace
and you get a 75 basis point effect whereas for longterm treasuries youve got less than 2
trillion total and you do a 500 billion operation and you only get a 30 or 50 basis point effect
so there youre participating in almost a third of the market and in the other case only about 10
percent  it may be true that those are the right elasticities but im wondering where those came
from  to get any effect in some of this stuff youve got to have some sort of market
segmentation going on so that you can play the yield curve game a little bit
the other question on that topic was related to president lackers question  the
presumption of these programs particularly the mortgagebacked purchases is that theres
something amiss in the markets that were trying to fix some intermediation problems or there
are some dysfunctions in those markets  and yet it seemed to me that as you expanded the so
called spillover effects and they got bigger and bigger and bigger it goes against the very
presumption of why you wanted to be in these markets in the first placeto try to promote
intermediation and liquidity  so i didnt know how these two assumptions connected or
reconciled with one anotherhow you could get both large spillover effects and maintain the
presumption that these markets were dysfunctional  i wasnt quite sure how those two pieces fit
together
on the swaps following president lackers comments i had some of the same questions
it seems to me that you offered three reasons why these swaps might be needed  one was this
issue of not having enough collateral in the foreign country for the central bank to do the lending
it wanted to do and the second reason was the foreign central bank maybe wouldnt accept the
us banks collateral  but the other reasons really had to do with the solvency of that
institution  it seems to me that from an operational point of view if a bank is insolvent its not
clear we ought to be lending to them in the first place so im not sure thats a reason to be in this
business  and given that it only applies to perhaps four or five banks if its really a liquidity
problem it seems to me that doing this through the discount window is a much more natural way
to think about what it is were doing and the problem were trying to solve  you offered some
concerns about how difficult that would be  i guess none of those seemed insurmountable to me
and the fact of the matter is that we would probably be doing most of this lending out of new
york anyway so its not as if youre going to have to worry about lots of the reserve banks
necessarily having to get foreign currency  it just seemed to me that it might be a better way to
go because a we do not want to lend to insolvent institutions and b the discount window
seems appropriate for exactly that liquidity problem rather than designing another facility
the last question i have is about the announcement effects  i worry that this is going to
be interpreted by the markets as a veiled or notsoveiled attempt to support one institution  i
think the markets will see through that very quickly  i dont know how to mitigate that if we
decide to do it  it could be viewed as a less than transparent effort on the part of this institution
to support a particular institution and i think that in turn may damage our credibility and
damage our reputation in the marketplace  i think if an institution is in trouble and we make the
decision to help it in some way then we ought to do it on its merits and not try to back door
that solution through another mechanism  thank you
mr gagnon  if i could start with the first couple of questions i think our views have
been evolving somewhat as weve been working on this  when i looked at the literature while i
was working on the december memo there wasnt an agreedupon way to normalize or scale
purchases like this  so what i did at the time was to take the most common approach which was
to look at the total size of the market across all maturitiesand that was about 5 trillion for
us treasuries  the idea was to consider a purchase over a broad range of maturities at the long
end say maturities of more than three years but i didnt finetune it to segments or look at just
the long end per se  you might want to do that
mr plosser  if you want to get a lot of response it seems to me youve got to think
about it as a segmented market of some kind
mr gagnon  i have been moving in the direction that youre thinking of about
whether there are differential effects but theres just not an accepted view in the literature on
how to do thisit isnt even really discussed very much  on the mbs market if you take mbs
and agency debt together and then net out the agency holdings of mbs you get about 7 trillion
but its not clear you should merge them in that way if they were each treated separately as two
separate marketsagencies and mbsthose would each be smaller  i wasnt sure i threw up
my hands and said well its roughly the same size  thats how we got the 500 billion
treated that way in each market  since we wrote the december memo treasury debt has gone
up a lot and its noted in our latest memo that in fact the range we get which is quite large
20 to 100 basis pointswould need to be shifted down some given that about 1 trillion of
treasuries have been issued just since we wrote the earlier memo  so the ground is shifting
beneath our feet  and i didnt really pay attention to that until quite late in the process  but
these ranges are quite large  we just dont know within a big range where the answer is
one final thing before i let dave jump in is given all of that we still thought purchases
of mbs especially initially would have a bigger effect on mbs yields than purchases of
treasuries would have on treasury yields because the mbs market was strained and spreads
were unusually high  we thought we could push the spreads down  and theyre still on the high
side historically so there is still i think some scope to do that  and if you keep going down that
road presumably the scope to do further improvements of spreads does diminish  in terms of
your question we have the effect of mbs purchases lowering the corporate spread to treasuries
dave is that right  and we have treasury purchases raising the corporate spread
mr reifschneider  yes
mr gagnon  so again we thought buying private assets would reduce private
spreads generally to some extent whereas buying treasuries which are the favored asset
actually might widen spreads
mr plosser  why is that  because the market would anticipate that we may go in
and buy those other private assets such as corporate bonds
mr gagnon  the thought was that the treasury purchases would be taking a safe
haven out of the market and then that would lower treasury yields more than other assets so it
would widen spreads  for mbs purchases it seemed to us that just generally youre helping
remove private sector assets so it should help all private sector assets relative to treasuries
mr plosser  its just a funny distortion it seems to me
mr reifschneider  there is a funny distortion but i think in some sense it can
almost be a distraction  one of the problems we had wasand we talked about this when we
wrote this downwhether we should stick with this bigger ownyield effect on mbs than on
treasuries  and our sense isi hope it came out in the memoswe dont really know what the
direct ownyield effects will be  we had sort of an experiment on the first 500 billionwhats
the second 500 billion going to be  so theres this issue of scale that could change quite a bit as
you go through time  whether there are spillover effects from mbs into treasuries or into high
grade corporatestheres a huge uncertainty about that
and for that reason i think you shouldnt interpret the model simulation evidenceto
the extent it is evidenceas suggesting oh mbs is the way to go because you get a much
bigger bang for your buck on that than you would for treasuries  i dont think thats the way to
interpret it at all  i think the way to interpret the model simulation results is that buying large
amounts of these securities whether its treasuries or mbs has at least a fighting chance of
bringing down the general level of longterm interest rates  and if you can do that and if that
spills over into the stock market the exchange rate that sort of thing then you potentially get a
major stimulus to the real economy
if the program just becomes narrow on one particular marketsuppose you just drive
down mbsthen you might not get very much for that  maybe you would get a little bit
moremaybein the case of mbs because then youre affecting mortgage rates and refi
effects and house pricesmaybebut its not really where the big payoff comes from at least
as far as these particular stimulations go  the big payoff comes from general reductions in the
level of all longterm rates and then these other things follow  so we thought that was
important  thats really the main way to think about the program
mr plosser  what i was trying to get at was this issue that the payoff is lowering all
longterm interest rates  and your assumption is that youve got this differential spread effect
is that driving this notion that buying mbs might be differentially better  why wouldnt you
just buy treasuries and get the spillover
mr reifschneider  right  joe and i may part company here but i dont think
theres a strong case that buying mbs is definitely more advantageous than treasuries  i think
we just dont know enough about what size the effect is  there are reasons to think that it might
be bigger in the case of mbs but its very difficult to say
mr gagnon  i would just note that mbs yields have come down a lot more than
treasury yields over this period so that would support our view  whether that would continue
for the next 500 billion or the 500 billion after thatmaybe not
mr plosser  well that really prompts the other question  whats the appropriate
way to think about the scales of these operations  how do we think about diminishing returns in
these markets
mr reifschneider  its anyones guess and its also the case as joe said in his
remarks that the more you focus on one market the more youre not really taking a diverse
strategy on something in which its not quite clear how this is going to play out  also the more
you focus on one market the more the question arises at some point  do you just decouple that
market from everything else
i think the second question that you raised had to do with this issue of fixing market
dysfunction and whether that was a potential conflict if you were getting this better economy
although we thought of the bigger mbs effect as maybe having potentially a somewhat bigger
bang for the buck because it might be helping to ease certain market strains we thought in all
cases that the reason for this policy is not to deal with the strains of financial markets per se  it
may have that effect by strengthening the economy and so on and so forthan indirect effect
but the main purpose was to get around the zero bound by driving down the average level of
longterm interest rates and getting other general financial conditions to improve
chairman bernanke  trish did you have a comment
ms mosser  yes i had a comment about how long this goes on  it seemsboth from
our mbs purchase program and from the uks announcementthat a huge amount of the
interest rate effect happens on announcement not on execution  it doesnt grow over time as the
purchases get bigger and bigger and bigger  boomthe rates fall  discerning spread changes
from the purchase levels is very tricky business and so is the macro effecti wouldnt venture
there  but that announcement effect happens because of the assumption that the central banks
are going to keep buying for a while not that theyre just going to do it for a month or two and
then stop the program and go away  i am fairly certain that in the us well see that reaction in
mortgage spreadsif the determination was made to stop in july the forward rates in july would
pop right up and wed be back to approximately where we were in january  theres a question
already arising about what the bank of england is going to do after three months
mr plosser  well uncertainty about our policies really creates a lot of problems
ms mosser  yes
chairman bernanke  okay  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  id like to congratulate you on being a tough
taskmaster with having us sit and listen to an hours worth of briefings without any questions  i
had seven but im down to three now  laughter  and ill be jumping around too because of
that  id like to ask a question of dave reifschneider first having to do with exhibit 3 on the
inflation forecast under largescale asset purchases  let me mention at the outset that ill reveal
later on in this meeting that im not overly concerned about inflation but having seen this chart
im suspicious of this and its in the way that the analysis is done  as i read the bluebook it
seems that the unconstrained optimal policy has inflation rising because inflation expectations
rise and you have inflation expectations depend on errors in the taylor rule as i understand it
so im guessing that the model is seeing very accommodative monetary policy and translating
that into increases in inflation expectations and thats why inflation is up  now im going to
guess that you do not have that same effect in these other forecasts
mr reifschneider  yes
mr evans  and that makes no sense to me because the whole point is to replicate an
accommodative monetary policy  so i would have come up with some translation of how
accommodative and unusual this is and tried to feed this into it  success would be when you
come up with a nontraditional policy that matches that the unconstrained outcome because thats
what were trying to do with the optimal policy  my guess is that if you went back and were
successful this inflation outlook would have more overshooting right  over 2 percent  so i
dont think we can rely too much on that chart
mr reifschneider  i agree 100 percent  when we were doing the bluebook box
we had this discussion  we saw that this is a real limitation of the modelthat in one case it
gets to learn off of what the fed funds rate is doing relative to the rest of the economy and in the
other case it doesnt know how to learn off of these largescale asset purchases  so we said
what are we going to do about it  do we just write something down  do we try to come up
with the correct fix  and the answer was we had ideas for how to fix it correctly but there is no
way were going to figure out the right way to do this in a week  so you are exactly correct
mr evans  i like the model analysis  i think its very useful and i think this is just a
limitation and thats how everybody should interpret it because youre doing a great job on the
unemployment rate here  that sort of tips you off
let me jump to the balance sheet scenarios because i looked at those scenarios but
didnt see one that in light of disinflation risk i would like to see  if it were costly to have one
more i would drop one of the others instead  the ones that id like to see are where the
committee finds itself in a position where we need to raise rates but we have a lot of sticky
assets on our balance sheet were not quite sure how to address that and we dont get legislative
relief  while i do not put a high probability on this scenario i think its important to understand
it  what if inflation expectations rose  i think it would have to be an exogenous increase
something that is not currently imbedded in my thinking and in the model analysis herebut
what if  certainly a lot of people are out there looking at our balance sheeti think
incorrectlybut theyre looking at it and saying somethings going to get out of hand  so if
we could see a scenario like that including how we would have to grapple with balancing the
conflicts it would be very informative  thats more of a suggestion
finally i have a relatively elementary question about the talf  what is the value
added of the investor in the middle in this entire transaction  were bringing hedge funds to the
table and ive thought well theyre going to help with price discovery to make sure that this
issuance is really right but i dont know that thats really a strong role  theres a lot of private
capital on the sidelinesaccording to what everybody tells usand theyre going to bring a very
small part of it to the transaction  but what they are demandingi hear from everybody i talk
toare very high levered rates of return which hedge funds are typically associated with
delivering  this is going to be in relatively lowrisk transactionstriplea  were not expecting
to lose on them but we could
but what does this mean  were hoping this will kickstart a secondary market  its that
kick starti dont know where that comes from  theres capital on the sidelines  what will
bring it to the table  i would guess that they would start by looking at this and saying well the
safest investment has 20 percent rates of return  so from here on out the risk curve the rates
should be higher  im already hearing from a lot of contacts that this is very expensive that
they have to deliver this and theyre not sure if they are going to participate very much
is the riskreturn frontier in some sense being moved up by this program  will
competition really bring these returns down  thats what we always think but i dont know
where competition is going to come from because its on the sidelines  i really have to
understand why its on the sidelines and why it will now be forthcoming
chairman bernanke  do you think theres an aggregation externality in
liquiditygetting activity going again so that people issue and so on  that would be one reason
why it would stimulate additional activity
mr evans  yeah  it seems like a hope at the moment  and im not opposed to
hoping a lot  laughter
chairman bernanke  i think thats our best tool right now  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  back to mr sheets  ive followed a few
international liquidity crises over the years and they often start in strange places and my
question is  do we need to think about exotic currenciescurrencies in which there is not really
a dollar swap or foreign currency swap market that could provide funding but where the
institution in mind may have pretty sizable book  the idea would be to try to nip something in
the bud before it gets to a hard currency
mr sheets  this is an issue ive actually spent a fair amount of time thinking about
absolutely its a concern  for instance one of these major institutions has a fair amount of
exposure to some of the secondary and tertiary emerging asian currencies  but the staff simply
didnt feel comfortable recommending the establishment of say 30 or 40 or 50 swap lines with
foreign central banks  we see this proposal as providing a foreign currency backstop for these
institutionsa safety net of some stripewhich hopefully between giving them access to yen
or euro or whatever the case may be and their dollar holdings would enable them to respond to
stresses in some of these secondary markets  i note that there is a risk  we dont see it as being
significant but theres a risk that these institutions might mobilize collateral from some of these
markets where there is liquidity support into some of these secondary markets hence becoming
more dependent on our liquidity facilities  but we didnt see any way around leaving some
residual liquidity risk  its a thorny thorny issue
mr chairman president plosser asked several questions about the swap lines  could i
go ahead and answer those
chairman bernanke  sure
mr plosser  thank you
mr sheets  first of all let me underscore that we see these lines as being focused
primarily and exclusively on liquidity  what we have in mind in that third case is that an
institution has been declared dead and is out of business were suggesting in that sort of a
scenario it might be useful for the authorities to have access to foreign currency liquidity in the
process of winding up the balance sheet and ensuring an orderly wrapup consistent with all of
the legal protocols and so on were not advocating a loan to an institution thats actually
insolvent as if it were a solvent institution
your second question was on the discount window versus the soma approach or the
swap approach  as i said in my remarks its something we spent a lot of time deliberating  on
the one hand there are certain aspects of this that have a discount window flavor  on the other
hand theres no history of the discount window doing foreign currency operations
mr plosser  weve done a lot of things without much history  laughter
mr sheets  on the other hand soma is where weve done all of those foreign
currency operations and at the end of the day operationally we just saw the discount window
approach as adding another layer of complexity  we had to figure out how to get the resources
from soma to the individual reserve banks in order to make the discount window loan  but
this was a very close call and it really was an issue of zigging rather than zagging  from an
operational standpoint we felt that soma was the better approach  trish do you want to
expand on that
ms mosser  not to be too technical here but because this swap would be cash
collateral in that sense theres not a loan actually  the institution would have to produce cash
dollars and get cash yen or whatever on the other side  if theyre in the middle of a distress
situation where do they get that cash  well theyre probably going to be getting it from the
discount window honestly or perhaps from the pdcf or somewhere else in order to execute this
transaction  so if theres lending going on to an institution like this it would be lending in
dollars  we dont want to impose where the cash dollars come from as a practical matter  we
dont know quite where their collateral might be  it might be in the pdcf  it might be in their
bank  and it seemed therefore that to separate the liquidity swap part out from the lending part
might actually have a few virtues
mr sheets  on your third question about the announcement effects we freely admit
that there are uncertainties surrounding the nature of those announcement effects  on the one
hand as you described theres a possible adverse reaction  on the other hand at present its
really no secret that major us financial institutions are experiencing a range of stresses so
moves by the central banking community to further bulletproof liquidity in the global economy
could be seen as a very positive thing
but i grant that there is uncertainty  we dont know exactly how it would be received
that is why we gave you this proposal a versus proposal b structure  and if the committee is
concerned about the possibility of an adverse announcement effect or concerned that the
announcement wouldnt have manageable effects then maybe the best approach would be a
delegation to the subcommittee the subcommittee could establish these lines closer to a time
when it looked like they were actually going to be drawn on
the other thought i have in response to your comments is even though were likely
talking about only a half a dozen institutions that have these sorts of vulnerabilities if adverse
circumstances arose the implications could be very severe  so i think it behooves us to think
through the possibilities beforehand and as necessary put in place mechanisms to address those
sorts of vulnerabilities to the extent that we can
chairman bernanke  nathan would you address an elementary question  if we
delegate the authority to the foreign currency subcommittee why wouldnt that appear in the
minutes for example
mr sheets  it would appear in the minutes  but draft resolution b which is the
delegation to the subcommittee is not nearly as specific as draft resolution a  this is just
saying that the fomc delegated to the foreign currency subcommittee the capacity to negotiate
these foreign currency swap linesit doesnt delineate the lines with the same degree of
specificity that the other resolution does  in addition its not saying that these lines are
establishedits only saying that the subcommittee has the capacity to establish them if it so
chooses  so its not as specific and our view at least is that it wouldnt be seen by the markets
or by the world as indicating the same degree of urgency as an actual approval of the lines
would
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i have a couple of questions and both of
them have been answered indirectly through our give and take but i wanted to make sure i was
clear in my understanding of these issues  both president hoenig and president lacker have
asked my first question but im going to ask it in a third way just to make sure im clear  as
were contemplating the extension of the talf into these other more narrow categories is it
because there are critical problems in these markets  or is it also a supply issue  that is we
cant reach even the currently announced 200 billion if we are purchasing securities only in the
categories that weve already announced
the second question is somewhat related and again i think youve already answered
this  do we know who is purchasing the lowerrated tranches of the securities and what price
are they paying for them  i know mr chairman you said that the securitization market isnt
even existent but a lot of my contacts have been saying that it is important to the functioning of
the abs market to also get those lowerrated securities purchased and trading
mr nelson  let me distinguish in my answer between those assets which we
requested the board to add this week and the completion of talf 20  for the assets that are
being added this week the objective is to fill out the abs space largely  thats the market that
in fact shut down in the fourth quarter
ms pianalto  so that means that there are both critical problems in that market and
that in order to get the dollar amount that were trying to put into that market we need to expand
the asset classes
mr nelson  these asset classes themselves are smaller than the ones that have
already been approved but they are nevertheless relatively large in size  but it wont get us
meaningfully closer to the ceiling  its addressing a market  were addressing it at this point
because the assets are quite similar to the ones that weve already added so that we were able to
review their risks and bring them on board quickly
mr madigan  president pianalto the reason for doing this is because those markets
like the other abs markets are not functioning
chairman bernanke  were not trying to fill up the bucket
ms pianalto  if we wanted to take on less risk we could stay in the one market
there are enough of those securities  this is more about addressing the critical issues in those
other markets
mr nelson  yes thats right  and in fact some of the sectors that were proposing
for inclusion were harmed by the initial announcement because they are near substitutes to those
things that we announced we were including  so it was very desirable to finish that phase  i
think that the answer is relatively similar in the next stageits just that theres much more
review that needs to be done  perhaps it will be done within a month but it then moves to the
larger space of markets that are also impaired but are similar in that they are the securitized
highquality space of newly originated securities  im sorryyour other question
ms pianalto  is there any activity on the lowerrated paper  we are taking the
triplea  is there any activity in the lowerrated securities
mr nelson  i dont exactly know  in many cases the lowerrated tranches are
retained by the issuers so that theyre able to issue the triplea securities by retaining the lower
rated  i dont have any specific information about other lowerrated tranches that have been
issued in conjunction with admittedly just a handful of abs that are being issued at this
subscription and who is purchasing those
ms pianalto  thank you
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i have two questions  the first one follows
up on president evanss earlier question  its one for spence  i have been somewhat concerned
about exit strategies  i think its probably going to be quite a while before we have to worry
about it but i think id feel better about expanding some of these programs if we did have that
worked out  when i read the balance sheet scenarios i was comforted at first to see that its
going to be a very long time before we need to deal with this at all  but then i looked at it a little
bit more carefully  i thought maybe there was something in the scenario you laid out that was
inconsistent because it was based on the march greenbook forecast but that assumed no
additional unconventional policies  then in your baseline you added 500 billion in purchases
of mbs which in the staff memos on that program has quite a bit of macro impact  it seemed
to me that with the likely impact of a 500 billion program we would have a stronger economy
than in the baseline  we would probably want to be raising rates in 2012 rather than 2014  i
guess that would be about the same time that the talf was building up and might be difficult to
unwind  so my question is  have i misunderstood that or have i taken too sanguine a message
from your scenario about exit strategies
my second question is for bill and it concerns the extension of the talf from newly
originated assetbacked securities to legacy assets  as i recall there were just a couple of
paragraphs in the memo on that  but it seems to me to be a very big step and im not sure i
really understood it  is this considered the ppif program
chairman bernanke  president yellen in just a few minutes i will brief on all of
the developments in the treasury program including this and the ppif and the fdic role
mr hilton  well its a good observation  the assumptions we took for the baseline
were just purely the economic ones  we did have an extension built into the outright purchase
program in the baseline of 500 billion as youve noted but we did not try to calibrate a
feedback effect as you suggest which would be a reasonable thing to do  that could move up a
bit the period in which you might want to be otherwise raising the target rate
chairman bernanke  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  some of my questions are for david and
joe  im looking at exhibit 3 again  i think the overall analysis is beautiful but this
unconstrained policy with the negative nominal rates is not really a feasible outcome  the truth
is you dont know what would happen because its not feasible  but then to put that on here as
where wed like to be in these pictures i think gives a little bit of a misleading idea about how
we should think about these largescale asset purchases  would it be possible to say if i could
pursue an optimal unconstrained policy just on asset purchases heres how much id do and
heres how id let it unwind  maybe that should be the baseline and we should skip the
negative fed funds rate  is that possible  what would that look like  would that get you all the
way to the funds rate line or throw that line out  or where would it take us
mr reifschneider  its possible  unfortunately i havent run it and im kicking
myself because we did talk about whether we ought to run it  so i dont know what the answer
is  i do know that if you had a 2 trillion program and you went by our assumptions youd
replicate the hypothetical and completely unattainable and maybe completely unrealistic
unconstrained optimal policy line  one question would be  whats the cost of buying all of
these longterm securities  im not sure what that is  this is part of the reason we hesitated on
running this  but if you were completely unconstrained youd probably buy everything you
could get your hands on in an attempt to drive longterm rates right to zero  but presumably
thered be some balance sheet costsim not sure how to calibrate or describe exactly what
those costs are  presumably thered be a shadow cost so you wouldnt buy everything you
could get your hands on  but the basic proposition that buy a lot would be a good thing to
doyes that would flow from that
mr bullard  so we have a baseline which is just to stick with our zero nominal
interest rate conventional stuff and not do anything else just let the economy play out  then
we say well we can improve on that with some asset purchases  but we dont want to go too
far because you just get too far out of bounds
mr reifschneider  right
mr gagnon  one of the costs might be fiscal in some sense
mr bullard  the natural thing to ask is  why are there limits on this  as ive said
before theres the mystery of round numbers  why 500 billion  why not 750 billion  why
not 15 trillion
chairman bernanke  i think its the problem president yellen raised which is the
exit strategy  is there a cost to exiting  i think thats the main constraint  also there are
probably some costs associated with having banks holding enormous amounts of excess reserves
mr reifschneider  i think the staff decided that buying a trillion was feasible and
buying 2 trillion may be feasible  but at some point its more of a question for you  and what
point is it just not feasible to go beyond between the market problems you potentially create and
the potential problems in setting up for exiting  i dont know what the limit is but i think the
gist of your question is  whatever that limit is would it make sense to go to it  on this kind of
analysis the answer is yes whatever that feasible limit is
mr bullard  our job as policymakers is to somehow trade those off  and i guess
the model just doesnt help us with that
mr reifschneider  no
mr plosser  but the question is  wouldnt it be useful to try to get some handle on
it  suppose that limits not 2 trillion suppose its 750 billion  how do i think about what that
number looks like even within some ballpark  i think it would just be very helpful for us to
think about when those diminishing returns on the types of costs that the chairman alluded to
begin to kick in  and how do we think about that
chairman bernanke  ms mosser
ms mosser  theres a completely different set of limitations namely how much the
payment and settlement system can handle depending on how compressed we make these
purchases  we have not done this yet for treasuries but for mortgagebacked securities we
think that if we tried to buy 1 to 2 trillion more this year we would come close to breaking
it
mr bullard  its great to know these kinds of constraints
ms mosser  its possible theres a workaround for those sorts of things  but if there
is wed have to start it tomorrow
chairman bernanke  we could just acquire fannie and freddie directly
laughter
mr bullard  i cant give up the floor without tormenting mr sheets  in your
report and in some of the questions weve talked about moral hazard problems  your response
which i thought was a good one was that you were going to do the pricing in a way that made it
a backstop facility so that you gave the proper incentives to financial firms to stay out of this
facility unless it was absolutely necessary  is your sense that thats going on with the other
swaps especially in europe  are we pushing them so that they are avoiding the same problem
on the other side  or do you think we run the risk of becoming a permanent part of the market
for dollar funding elsewhere in the world just sort of a routine thing
mr sheets  my sense is that the pricing of our dollar swap facilities globally and
particularly in europe is such that they had been attractive during times of stress  but as the
market has healed a little bit theyre less attractive  let me just be really concrete here  the
outstandings to the ecb as of early december were about 314 billion under the swaps
program  at the end of last week those outstandings were down to 168 billion  so we have
seen a sizableslightly less than 50 percentdrop in those outstandings  similarly global
swaps outstanding in early december were 582 billion and at the end of last week they were at
330 billion
so i think were seeing the program and the pricing work the way that we want it to
during those yearend pressures and with exceedingly high stress this liquidity was very
attractive  as the situation seems to ease a little bit its not as attractive  i know that a number
of our counterparties have had auctions where theyve seen significant declines in participation
some that dont have unlimited lines have actually seen some of their auctions undersubscribed
heres another example of the decline on a much smaller swap line  australia was running about
27 billion outstanding in late november and is now below 10 billion  so i think the pricing of
these facilitiesand trish may want to expand on thishas been done so that the incentives are
the way we want them to be
ms mosser  i think where the libor rates are well inside for example one week
and one month those are the operations that are most undersubscribed and least used  theres
more in threemonth where the market rates are still more elevatedagain this is reflecting
credit risk and balance sheet constraints at institutions and how long theyre willing to lend to
each other
i think the ultimate question is  if things continue to improve will the swaps ultimately
wind all the way down to zero  i think theres probably a risk that there would still be a few
institutions that would like to continue to borrow and well just have to take away the punch
bowl when the time comes  but like nathan im encouraged that as rates come down and in
particular as we basically get underbid by the market the facility usage drops off pretty quickly
so as long as that trend continues i think were fine  whether in the end we have to take it
away is a possibilityweve had those discussions with the other central banks
chairman bernanke  speaking of facility usagelaughterwhy dont we take
a coffee break for about 15 minutes and then we will recommence around 430  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  the next item on the agenda is billed as a discussion of the
balance sheet and lending program issues  what id like to do with your indulgence is to start
off by posting you on a number of developments that pertain to these programs and then make
some comments on some policy issues and then we can have an open discussion  i just want to
remind everyone of course that we have two full gorounds subsequent to this discussion so
lets make this part of it more informal and then everyone will have an opportunity of course in
the gorounds to give their views if they havent had a chance in the discussion
let me begin with some postings  first a relatively minor point  its time to announce
the amounts and schedules for the term auction facility for the second quarter  unless there are
objections i propose to follow the recommendation of the staff and approve 150 billion per
auction in april  that would be the same as weve had for some time now
the second thing i wanted to talk about is the accord discussions with the treasury
which i have mentioned a few times  i think that we are getting somewhat close to a possible
agreement and i want to update you on where thats going and its going to be relevant to some
of the other points i want to make  the subject of the accord will be a potential conflict between
the feds role as a monetary authority and as a financial stability authority the point being  how
do we define the role of the fed in such a way as to minimize the conflicts between those two
functions  currently what we have in mind is a short document that would havebesides an
introduction stating the motivationfour key general points
the first point would be a positive statement of the need for treasuryfederal reserve
coequal cooperation during this financial crisis so that is a positive good and something that we
want to continue to do
the second point is that although the fed may provide liquidity in its role of pursuing
financial stability the fed must be insulated from credit risk and must not undertake credit
allocation which the accord will state are within the province of the fiscal authorities  what is
meant by credit allocationand this relates to some of the discussion about the talfis
that to the extent that the federal reserve gets involved in credit markets we should try to do so
in a broad way that addresses the macroeconomic situation as opposed to picking winners and
losers within small categories of credit
the third of the four principles is the need to protect the feds monetary stability function
from the financial stability function if you will  in particular the fed and the treasury have
agreed on the need for sterilization tools that will allow the fed to prevent any increases in its
balance sheet from affecting its ability to conduct normal monetary policy  as brian already
said we have developed legislative language and i have promises from the administration of
the highest level of effort to go to the congress immediatelytodayto try to get reactions try
to get some approval of either fed bills or the sfp program and that would be attached to
legislation that is currently being contemplated  ill say more about that  as brian mentioned i
think we would prefer fed bills but we are putting both out there  the other thing that we are
prepared to do if we get resistance and which i think a few people around the table might
prefer is to put a sunset on fed bills or on this provision so that its only for the current
situation
the fourth element of the accord would be an agreement between us on the need for a
comprehensive resolution regime for systemically critical nonbank financial institutions which
we do not have and which i have called for and others have called fora way to wind down
nonbanks in a safe and orderly way  in particular we would want to say that a key element of
any such regime would be a careful definition of what role would be expected of the central
bank  we might have a rolewe might have a liquidity provision role we might have other
roles depending on what the congress wants to dobut it should be carefully defined  as part
of this sort of aspirationally the treasury at this pointand well just have to see how the
negotiation comes outwill state its intention that when it is able to do so it will remove from
our balance sheet the maiden lanes and the other residuals from our various rescue operations
so i believe that these are the main elements that we need  from my perspective it
preserves our ability to do what were doing now which is to continue to support credit market
functioning and to address the macroeconomic situation even though the interest rate is at the
zero bound  i realize it doesnt go as far as some perhaps might like but i do think that it will be
an important step a historic step towards defining an appropriate line between our various
functions
it should be clear that a principal reason that the treasury is being so cooperative is that
they would like us to support them in their bank rescue program  so what id like to do now is
tell you where that is and whats going on there and talk to you about what the feds role if any
would be in that  and i should say that we have not approved anything  but they are looking for
some kind of answer from us very quickly and therefore this would be an opportunity for
people to make comments
the original bank proposal of the treasury had five elements of which four have now
been laid out to the public  the supervisory assessment with the stress scenario the equity
instrumentthe mandatory convertible preferredthat would be given to banks that need it the
talfthe joint talfwhich of course is already as of this week in operation and the
foreclosure mitigation plan  the last element which has not yet been described and that we want
to get to is a publicprivate partnership for dealing with what they now call legacy assets  i
guess its like legacy systemsand the word legacy used to be a good word  laughter
i have to say that i agree with the objective  i supported the original tarp motivation
and a big part of that was to remove opaque and damaged assets from bank balance sheets  i
believe that is part of any successful bank cleanup program because it will allow banks to attract
private capital and give them balance sheet space to go back to normal lending  so i do think
thats an important element of the plan
currently this fifth element has in turn three parts  this is very complicatedsorry
the first part which has nothing to do with the fed is an fdic facility  the purpose of the
fdic facility would be to take damaged portfolios directly off of the balance sheets of banks
this would happen after the conclusion of our supervisory assessment during the sixmonth
period in which banks are supposed to be raising capital or otherwise taking action to stabilize
themselves  a bank would offer an asset pool and a thirdparty valuation agent would estimate
an expected price on the pool  then the supervisor and the bank would discuss implications for
pro forma valuations and the stability of the bankcapital needs and the like  so there would
be some preliminary discussion about whether or not the bank should actually engage in making
this offer  if the bank decides to offer the asset pool then the fdic would dispose of it in the
same way that it currently disposes of assets of failing banks  it would have an auction and the
price that the bank receives for the pool would be determined by the winning bidder  this is
going to be highly leveraged which is the reason that they hope to attract bidders who will pay
more than firesale prices  the leverage will come in two forms  one is that there will be an
8020 partnership between the us government and the private participant with 80 percent of
the capital from the government  and then there is leverage provided by the fdic which is
supported by fdic guarantees to attract funding  an example of the leverage is that given a
195 billion portfolio a private investor could have a 20 percent interest in it for 557 million
obviously this is a very highly leveraged position
why would banks want to do this  its not clear that they will but there are some
possible reasons  one is that we are looking in our supervisory assessment at embedded losses
that go beyond one year beyond the provisions  so banks may make the determination that its
in their interest to sell some portfolios even if theyre in the accrual book  second is the
proposition that by selling off assets a bank can make itself attractive to private equity and
thereby perhaps avoid a capital injection from the us government  so thats the motivation
of course typically the sale of assets if theyre marked down would create a bigger capital
hole than initially and so the us government will have to stand ready to provide enough capital
in case the private sector is not forthcoming
thats the fdic part of the plan  it covers only portfolios sold directly by banks and
possibly bank holding companies  the fdic is not willing or says it doesnt have the authority
to deal with assets that are not taken directly from banks  the other two parts of the plan involve
creating facilities to buy various classes of troubled or legacy assets essentially from anybody in
the market  and the question is  how would they work  so thats where the fed would be
involved under the treasurys proposal
before i talk about them let me just say one word about process  the fed has been a full
participant in all of these discussions  weve done the lions share of the work on a number of
these issues  and we have in general tried to resist the treasurys strong demand for
precipitant action and tried to slow them down and tried to make sure that we get this right if at
all possible  weve also been very careful throughout this process in trying to ensure necessary
protections for the fedthats what the accord is about  another example is that we essentially
vetoed a ringfencing proposal because we didnt like the way the fed was involved in those
types of operations  i should also say that i did have the opportunity to meet with the president
on these issues of course we talked about a wide variety of things but we spent about
20 minutes talking about the feds role and our concerns and our issues and he was very
receptive  in particular he promised his full support for sterilization tools  and ill mention
parenthetically that i have talked to him about inflation targets as well and he said that sounds
really good  im sure his advisers will get to him before longlaughterbut he was
interested in that
okay  so what are these two last parts of the plan  one part is publicprivate
partnerships which are basically hedge funds that have 80 percent government ownership and
20 percent private ownership  you could have the us government in partnership with pimco
for example  those hedge funds will be able to buy assets essentially from anybody there may
be some restrictions on the type of asset but not restrictions on whom they can buy them from
there would be a 2080 share in terms of returns because the private sector is putting up
20 percent of the capital
the final part is talf financingthat is the fed would allow these legacy assets to be
financed in the talf  its a little hard to see at first but if you look at it carefully youll see
that the combination of the publicprivate partnershipwhere the equity share gives shares in
the assetswith the financing facility is really economically equivalent to the fdic facility
and what appears to be a differencethe put option in the talf and the haircuts having to
differ according to the asset riskis actually paralleled in the fdic program because there
theyre going to have to set leverage according to asset class in more or less the same way  so
the combination of the two is essentially the same kind of thing but it works for any type of
asset
there are a number of issues  one is certainly the viability and workability of the
program  i have to say that our initial reactions were negative and we told the treasury that
our concern was that it would be very very difficult to deal with these very heterogeneous assets
and to find haircuts that would work for each asset  however we have looked at it more
carefully  a team that included mike gibson from the board and people from new york as
well has done what they called a proof of concept analysis to ask whether this could be made
to work  they looked at some representative asset classes and their conclusion is that it is
workable  but they think that if were going to do this it would be necessary to get outside
contractors to recommend to us what the haircuts ought to be what the risk profiles ought to be
and what capital we should require for safety  in addition they think we should have asset
managers to take care of these things so that we dont have to burden our staff further
the second issue is what it implies for the size of the fed balance sheet  we had
previously discussed this when secretary geithner first put out the bank plan  he announced
with our agreement that the 200 billion talf program could be expanded up toa very
cautious set of wordsup to 1 trillion  at that time we thought that the extra money would
go into cmbs and rmbs  the idea here is that we would not have a change in thatthat even
if legacy assets are included we would still be up to 1 trillion  so in that sense we would
not be changing the rules of the game
my own view is that we will not get to 1 trillion  first of all the treasury is very short
of capital  it has to fund not only the capital of the banks but it also has to fund the fdic
program and the publicprivate funds as well as the talf  so thats going to be a significant
barrier to expansion  then i think that practically as weve seen the process is just very
difficult  it requires a lot of analysis and what weve seen in the initial work on some of the
simpler assets is that we may not get the demand that we thought  and in any case its not
going to happen for some months down the road so there are implications for the balance sheet
but theyre not different from what they were prior to this
with respect to assurances ive already talked about the accord  and particularly with
regard to the fed bills work we will maintain the no credit risk principle by insisting that we
be fully protected if we do this  ill mention one other thing which has not been explored but
which seems to me to be a very live possibility  the senior debt obligations of the talf would
be very safe assets because they would be senior not only to the fed and the treasury but also
to the haircuts so it seems possible to me that one other way to mitigate the effects of this on the
feds balance sheet would be to sell debt to the private sector to finance part of the talf  i
should say that we had at least one presentation on this to the board  the board has not taken a
decision  we wanted to bring this up here and hear comments from the fomc  we are not fully
persuaded that its workable and viable  in any case were going to have to come to some
conclusion pretty soon because the treasury is very eager to get going  but we did want to
bring this to you and tell you what was going on  ill be happy to answer questions about this in
a moment
before i give up the floor though i want to talk just a bit about the policy decision for
this meeting  the most likely direction that we would go as suggested by the alternative
statements would be to increase our asset purchases  im concernedi dont want us to be
making that decision in the last five minutes tomorrow when were trying to work on the
statement  so id like to encourage at least some discussion of that today because it fits in with
the presentations that we heard  although we dont have to make a final decision until
tomorrow at least id like to know where people are roughly speaking on this topic
i will tell you what i think because im fairly open on the subject  i do think that as we
will discuss the economy has deteriorated  our balance sheet has shrunk over the last few
months  its true that well continue to buy mbs but our talf activities even if we get into
the legacy talf are not likely to scale up for some time  so my own viewagain i want to
hear everybodys viewsis that at this meeting we ought to approve an additional asset
purchase  one possibility which is probably the minimum we ought to do would be to double
the agency program from 500 billion mbs and 100 billion debt by midyear to 1 trillion and
200 billion by the end of the year  this would essentially do for the second six months what
were doing for the first six months of 2009  that certainly would be a possibility  let me just
say that im very interested to hear views  we might want to go bigger than that if we think that
we want to be more aggressive
the other possibility of course as weve discussed is also or alternatively to buy
treasury securities  people will express their views on that  i think thats a potentially useful
direction to go in and im very open to that if thats what people want to do  i think the uk
example is promising  it does show that there can be benefits not only to the treasury market
but also to the broader private markets  and im not that concerned about adverse implications
say for inflation expectations because weve all seen treasury purchases in many other
contexts besides the british context the japanese have done a lot of this the swiss the
canadians are going to start doing this  it would be potentially in conjunction with mbs
purchases  so i think there are issues there but im open to this possibility
i want to say that i would like to hear some discussion today and in the goround
tomorrow so that when we get to the final policy decision we wont be making a spurofthe
moment decision  well have a sense of where everybody is and what the best outcome might
be  let me stop there and open it up for general discussion or questions  lets try to maintain an
informal format and remember we have two gorounds ahead of us  questions or comments
president plosser
mr plosser  i have just a clarifying question  when you say this stuff merges into
the talf im just not quite sure i understood how this would work  could you explain that
again
chairman bernanke  basically what happens now is that an investor buys a
security and leaves that security with the fed and gets 90 percent financingor
10 to 1 leverageagainst that security  theres a put option because its nonrecourse lending
so it would be the same thing  in this case the publicprivate hedge fund80 percent treasury
20 percent private sectorwould purchase some rmbs and it would finance that rmbsget
leverage on that rmbsby depositing it at the talf in the same way that an investor does
currently  the main difference is that the haircuts would have to adjust according to the risk
characteristics of the assets
mr plosser  okay  so we would have to set a new schedule of haircuts for these
securities because presumably they would be the much riskier and perhaps toxic assets of the
banking system
chairman bernanke  yes  and wed have to make sure we had sufficient capital
from the treasury  i think that what might be going on is that these might happen in oneoff
deals where portfolios are being presented and that would require us to hire investment banks or
asset analysts to do the work for us and give us their assessments of the risk characteristics
mr plosser  back to the accord issue for the momentyou talked about maiden
lane going back to the treasury at some point or under certain conditions  would these assets in
the talf be candidates for that same sort of transfer
chairman bernanke  in one indirect senseif we find that we can no longer
finance them because of monetary policy considerations then under the sfp model treasury
financing would replace fed financing  but the difference between this and maiden lane is that
maiden lane involves very longterm assets and the talf program is a threeyear program
and presumably it would be winding down
mr plosser  okay  thank you
chairman bernanke  a twohander from president evans
mr evans  just to clarifythe legacyasset aspect of this would be within the
currently envisioned 1 trillion
chairman bernanke  within the current limits yes  president lacker
mr lacker  you said something that confused me  you said we would be protected
against risk because we would be senior to the treasury  then you said and the haircuts
chairman bernanke  i was talking about the possibility of getting private debt as
a substitute for fed financing in the talf  so thats a hypothetical possibility  but in general
the way the talf works is that we have a haircut to protect us and if there are any further
losses then the treasury is the first to take them
mr lacker  but the haircut and the treasury capital arent two separate things
right
chairman bernanke  no they are two separate things
mr plosser  but the treasury capital is the same  the ratio hasnt gone up for these
assets relative to the talf assets
chairman bernanke  weve got to figure out two parameters  probably the
simplest thing would be to pick a single ratio of treasury capital to leverage because we dont
want to do that asset by asset  so the haircuts will have to vary and the combination of the
haircut and the treasury capital will protect the fed against loss
vice chairman dudley  or we could take the treasury capital and apply it
against all of the assets
chairman bernanke  thats what im saying yes
mr lacker  so thats separate from the treasury capital invested alongside the
private sector in the partnerships
chairman bernanke  thats separate from it yes  treasury capital comes in in
two placesone to give leverage and the other to protect the fed
mr lacker  back to maiden lanewould that include the two ringfence
guarantees
chairman bernanke  again this is aspirational  its not going to happen in the
next six weeks  its not going to happen in the current political atmosphere  but it would be a
stated intention of the treasury that at some point they would be looking to take these things off
our hands and that would in my mind include those things as well
mr lacker  i may be pressing you for things that havent been put on the table but
do you envision a public statement with all of these elements in it
chairman bernanke  yes within a week or two
mr lacker  and would it lay out a timetable on any of this or the transfer
chairman bernanke  it will state that we are actively engaged on the fed
billssfp front  it will state the principle that the fed is not to take credit risk which we will
enforce  it will state our intention which is a strong intention on both sides to undertake the
negotiation on a resolution regime that will define what role the fed might have in those kinds of
contexts  and it will state the aspirational goal of the treasury taking maiden lane off our
balance sheet
mr lacker  help me understand the statement about the fed not taking credit risk
because we do and its just a matter of degree
chairman bernanke  well de minimis  obviously we take credit riskeven the
cds spreads on treasuries are not zero
mr lacker  would we have an understanding with the treasury about what de
minimis means
chairman bernanke  bill talked about it  in the case of the talf we have
worked out criteria where very extremevery extremeloss outcomes do not touch the fed
and probably dont even touch the treasury but they dont touch the fed
mr lacker  have we quantified that  what is it
chairman bernanke  bill do you want to talk about that
mr nelson  in the risk analysis for talf 21 we looked at a scenario which we
considered to have a 1 percent probability  and even in those scenarios all of the credit costs
were covered by the risk spread itself so not only the fed but also the treasury did not take any
losses  our objective is basically to follow that principle with the legacy talf i think the
principle would be that under our stress scenario neither the treasury nor the fed would be
expected to take losses  so losses in order to come to the fed would first have to eat through
the treasury protection which we dont expect to happen at all in the stress scenario
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  im trying to understand this  the  talf is for three years and the way
i see it were taking the assets they put into this organization which you expect to liquidate and
recover at least enough to the point where were protected  but how confident are you that we
can roll this stuff off our balance sheet in three years  these are distressed assets  so we might
have to turn them over later or the market would have to change so much that you could sell
them and whoever has the 20 percent risk would take any writeoff  i see us as taking the bad
bank position in a good bankbad bank scenario
chairman bernanke  were financing the bad banks  we arent the capital in the
bad bank
mr hoenig  as long as in the liquidation we dont go past the capital thats placed
into it right
chairman bernanke  thats right  but in terms of your other question well
have to be very careful about maturities and so on  for a threeyear loan when the three years
are up if the value of the asset has fallen by more than the haircut they will put the asset to the
bad bank and the asset managers of the bad bank will sell it or dispose of it  if the value of the
asset has not fallen as much as the haircut then there will be a strong incentive for the public
private partnersand of course for the government because the treasury will be the dominant
partnerto find other financing
mr hoenig  in your exploration of this have you thought about the congress setting
up a good bankbad bank facility  are they resistant to that  or do we just think thats not a
good option
chairman bernanke  i think the administration is weighing the possibility of
legislation to get additional authorities for example considering whether it would be possible to
change the scoring on the tarp which is very unfavorable  if they can get appropriate
authorities i think they would do that  but the politics is just unbelievably bad and its very
difficult to get anything done  i think its their intention to try  i think they believe that they
may not have enough resources to do all they need to do in which case they will pursue other
resources and we can see what happens  my own guess is that one way or another were
probably not going to end up taking very much stuff either because there wont be that much
interest or because there will be other facilities or because some other arrangement will
develop  this is in order to have something thats part of the bigger program in the short term
mr fisher  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr fisher  i didnt understand you there for a second  when you say would not
take much stuff are you saying the bad bank would not take some of these assets
chairman bernanke  i was just conjecturing that in the end this legacy talf
would probably not do very much business
mr evans  is that because of the pricing
chairman bernanke  because of the pricing and the difficulty of finding private
sector participants
mr evans  its only a bad asset at a high price  if the thirdparty assessment comes
out at a reasonable price
chairman bernanke  right  so we have to mark it down to a market price which
wed lend against and then theres a haircut on top of that of course  so the question is  is that
attractive
mr fisher  can i come back to the treasurys quid pro quo particularly the third key
element the publicprivate partnership  you mentioned that there was discussion within the
boardwhat are the concerns as the board views it
chairman bernanke  the complexity is one issue  would we be able to figure
out how to do haircuts in a way that would be meaningfulthat is so that on the one hand the
haircuts would be not so conservative as to imply no business and on the other hand theyd be
conservative enough to provide enough safety  another issue that we and the fomc are
considering more broadly is  what are the implications for our balance sheet and management
of our balance sheet
mr fisher  this may be for later discussion  maybe im a little confused  if i go
back to our previous discussion and a comment that i think mr nelson madedid you say that
we were looking at this the legacy assets into the talf as a way to take some bad assets off the
balance sheets of banks
mr nelson  is the legacy talf a means to try to take the bad assets off bank
balance sheets  yes thats one of the objectives
mr fisher  im a little confused  could you clarify that please
chairman bernanke  the way it is now conceived the fdic would be
responsible for taking portfolios directly from banks and probably bank holding companies  so
the answer to that question i guess is no  the intent would be to try to create more liquidity
and pricing discovery and so on in these markets generally
mr fisher  so we would use the publicprivate hedge fund as you described it as a
way to end up with some kind of pricing mechanism for legacy assets that trade on the market
chairman bernanke  correct  and i suppose if they wanted to buy from a bank
i dont think there would be any restriction on that  but thats not the point of it
mr fisher  it just seems to me we are going throughthis is a comment and it
again may be based on ignorancea lot of jujitsu here to get around the issue of creating a good
bankbad bank taking the toxic assets in the bad bank and clearing it in that way  the talf is
becoming inordinately complicated  and i guess if youll forgive a horrible pun im worried
talf is getting too clever by half  laughter  were adding one segment on top of another
just as were beginning to figure out how this thing is going to work
chairman bernanke  as i said im sure this will not be operational for months
so thats one reason that i think that we cant wait for it in terms of our broader policy
objectives
mr fisher  but you are talking about moving very quickly on this
chairman bernanke  its still going to be months i am sure
mr plosser  mr chairman just a twohander  i was going to ask a question about
the difference between the fdic program and the talfrelated program  how would i think
about what type of assets would go to the fdic program and which ones would come in to us
through the hedge funds  based on the relative pricing of those two mechanisms and how they
would work which vehicle would attract what types of assets
chairman bernanke  as i said economically theyre very similar  the fdic
though would deal directly with banks and could take a whole portfolioit could be a
completely heterogeneous portfolioand there would be a bid on that portfolio just the same
way as when you wind down a failed bank  i would imagine that the remit for these hedge funds
would be buy rmbs on the market  i think it would be less heterogeneous than the portfolios
that the fdic would be taking  the fdic would be a much more classic bad bank type of
structure
mr lockhart  would the design of the heterogeneous portfolios be up to the seller
or up to the fdic  theres a sort of rtc analogue here  in the rtc period assets were put
together to make the package attractive enough to bid on knowing there was some terrible stuff
but also some notsobad stuff in it  who is going to design those portfolios
chairman bernanke  if im incorrect on anything please staff members dont
hesitate to correct me but my understanding is that the supervisors and the bank together would
determine the portfolio  so in many cases there would presumably be a mixture of accrual and
markedtomarket assets a mixture of different kinds of assets derivatives and other things that
are hard to break off but can be part of a portfolio  president bullard
mr bullard  i just wanted to ask a few questions about the accord  what kind of
legal standing does an accord have  is this a gentlemans agreement or what is it
chairman bernanke  well were one step ahead of the 1951 accord which
wasnt even written down  laughter
mr bullard  except in textbooks
chairman bernanke  to my knowledge there is no document representing the
1951 accord
mr bullard  okay  so its a genuine agreement
chairman bernanke  this would be an agreement signed by me and by the
treasury secretary and approved also by the president and the administration  we would share
it with congressional leaders as well
mr bullard  the 51 case held for a long time because there were no attempts to
change it subsequently and thats the hope here as well i guess  but its really just an
agreement between the administration and the fed for now  two of the provisions are really
asks from the congress  do i have that right
chairman bernanke  right  they are asks from the congress  the treasury and
the fed agree they are needed and will cooperate in trying to get those things passed
mr bullard  the congress may or may not agree to them
chairman bernanke  well thats always of course a risk
mr bullard  so the accord in 51 was about how the fed and the treasury were
actually going to interact  it did not involve this part about what were going to get the congress
to do or not do  im just trying to understand what the object is
chairman bernanke  for example it will formalize the understanding that the
fed will take no credit risk in the talf
mr bullard  okay
chairman bernanke  im happy to answer as many questions as people want to
ask but again i also hope to hear something about asset purchases before we close today  vice
chairman
vice chairman dudley  on asset purchases laughter i think there are lots of
good reasons to escalate  the economy is weaker financial conditions are tighter in addition
the talf is off to a slow start because of all of the stuff thats swirling around on aig and
tarp  the broader talf i think is going to come much later  while there might be an
announcement on legacy talf relatively soon the actual operationalization of that i think is
going to take many monthsjust given that the talf 10 which were enacting today took
four months  and the ppifits not even clear whether banks are going to be willing to sell
assets to the ppif  are they going to get a high enough price to engage in those transactions
so it seems to me that right now its on us  and its more on us than it was even a few weeks
ago because i think the political climate has deteriorated significantly so the ability of the
administration to go back to the congress and get more tarp money is significantly less than it
was even a few weeks ago
then the question is  what should we escalate to  the lines in davids graph suggest
that 2 trillion would put us roughly on top of the unconstrained line  and conveniently the
numbers i was going to advocate total 2 trillion by coincidence rather than by design  we did
not talk beforehand as david can attest  laughter  i think that id want to escalate the agency
mbs program to more than 1 trillion because escalating to 1 trillion through yearend is
basically keeping the run rate exactly the same as the program is doing right now which is
essentially 500 billion every six months  so i think we should escalate the program and i
would suggest 1 trillion  the market will not give us much credit for just extending the
program another six months at the same purchase rate  i think the market generally expects us to
extend the program so i dont think thats really going to have a lot of benefit
i would increase the agency debt from 100 billion to 200 billion so im at 22 trillion
to be honest  but im not counting that  i dont think the agency debt is really very important or
that effective but i think leaving it out raises more questions than its worth raising at this
juncture  and i would engage in a treasury purchase program  the last time i was here i
argued mostly against it  but i think the stakes are pretty high right now  we dont know
exactly how much a treasury purchase program would do but if we start one well be able to
answer that question  theres a lot of information that we really just dont have right now  so i
would suggest engaging in a treasury purchase program starting immediately up to
500 billion concentrating in 2year to 10year maturities and buying both nominals and tips
we can also purchase things outside of those maturities to avoid distortions to the shape of the
yield curve  but thats what i would do
one other thing before i give up the floori just want to stress what the point of the
reverse swaps is  the point is to prevent some bad piece of news that creates a liquidity run in
some foreign market from putting us in a very difficult position in which a foreign central bank
is unwilling to lend to a usowned company because it doesnt have enough collateral and we
dont have the ability to get them the money quickly enough to prevent a default  i think that we
want to do this  im not sure whether we want to delegate it to the subcommittee or actually
enact it in the fomc but it would be really unfortunate if we didnt do this and then something
happened that caused the exact problem that this reverse swap will address and then wed say
why didnt we do what we could have done to avert it  so its a beltandsuspenders
approach but i think were in an environment where we need both a belt and suspenders
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  on the asset purchases my view is that the
hole in aggregate demand is really quite large and as i look at the figure on the gap between the
optimal policy and the zero bound i think its really stunning so im open to proposals for
substantial purchases  in fact im not totally confident in any particular program that we have
proposed so i favor diversifying  both mbs and treasuries sounds like a pretty attractive
option from my standpoint  im not quite sure how to evaluate the numbers that the vice chair
just laid out  i know i cant disagree with him but i dont quite know how to calibrate these
other policy measures like in the greenbook and bluebook figure  so id like to hear more about
that tomorrow but im openminded
on the accord it sounds good  the way weve talked about it is that its a longterm
accord  right now we have a lot of assets on our balance sheet that we would like to be able to
get rid of  if issuing fed bills is the way to go that would be fine  you mentioned that some
might favor a sunset provision  would that be on the order of three or four years or 20 years
chairman bernanke  five years probably
mr evans  it sounds like its aimed at getting us out of the current situation and i
think thats a good idea  but over the next 30 years our ability to have that authority might be a
problem  in reading your testimony on the 133 authority and the grilling that you got i dont
recall anybody who thought it was a great idea that the fed had the authority to undertake this on
their own and they wouldnt admit that they knew that this was possible at least according to
what i had read  so i just wonder would a future accord be a 133type of activity that causes
us to acquire these assets and then wed need to issue bills  i guess im just wondering under
what circumstances we would issue bills
i think the lasting lesson from all of this is that we dont want to get here again that we
ought to conduct policy in a way to avoid this  future regulatory changes that might help out are
obviously one way market discipline is another and responding to large changes in asset prices
that we dont understand very well might be another  but keeping the average level of the fed
funds rate at a place where we dont expect to hit the zero bound again might be much more
attractive now having gone through this so that might be something we should talk about at
some point  if along the way you could get an explicit numerical price objective out of this that
would be quite good  and then lastly let me ask another question  if the likely takeup on our
talf for the legacy assets is low and given the prudent central bank lending that we are doing
at least according to the people i talk to in the marketplace they dont find this very attractive
is the treasury going to be satisfied with that  how are we going to respond to them
chairman bernanke  well my assumption is that they would move on to other
strategies which would involve perhaps the congress not us  which would be fine
mr evans  that would be more desirable from a public policy standpoint  thanks
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  on the swap lines i do think that we
could put in the minutes that its basically proceduralits symmetric with what other foreign
central banks have done with us  i would argue for being transparent  we need to be prepared
for foreign funding problems and i think it just makes sense to be clear on it
in terms of the resolution of holding companies which ties into the foreign swap lines i
think thats as important an issue as the fed bills and i think trying to find a way to push
resolution makes sense  if you could argue that if we had the resolution powers now we could
be doing much more effective things with aig there may be a hook to actually move things
along more quickly  i dont know where our thinking is but i see this as a chance to try to push
that particularly if it would give us an opportunity to abrogate contracts in the event that we or
somebody else had resolution power  but i think we should try to move that just as quickly as
the fed bills
in terms of the removal of problem assets i agree thats a critical component  i strongly
agree that we shouldnt be doing ringfencing institution by institution so im glad were
moving away from that strategy  i think the firstbest solution would be more aggressive
writedowns of assets creating a bad bank for the most troubled banks  i think its a much more
straightforward solution and i realize that it does mean much more capital for some banks
because we will be taking aggressive action  but i think that just as we shouldnt have banks
deferring losses we as the central bank and the treasury shouldnt defer losses if theyre really
on the balance sheet  the firstbest solution i think is to try to work with the bad bank solution
the talf for problem legacy assetsi think we shouldnt make these programs
particularly voluntary  if were going in and forcing writedowns and the writedowns are fairly
significant the banks are going to want to participate in the program because they will have
already taken the losses  so instead of trying to make it voluntary i think we should have the
writedowns be severe enough that theyre going to want to get the assets off their balance sheets
because theyve already taken the losses and theyre not trying to defer additional losses
thinking about how we can have a supervisory strategy that guarantees that outcome might
make it much easier than hoping that people volunteer their portfolios  to the extent that we can
do that that would be my preferred option
in terms of the policy i think this is the time to be very aggressive  i strongly prefer
option a in the bluebook or possibly even a little bit larger as vice chairman dudley has
suggestedid be open to that as well  were far from reaching either element of the dual
mandate over the forecast horizon  this is the time to push rates down  we have a new program
from freddie mac and fannie mae thats going to include refinancing  the refinancing involves
paying closing costs  now is the time to push the rates down so that the people who are
refinancing and participate in that program only have to pay the closing costs one time  it will
also square us with some of the other issues in terms of encouraging servicers to come up with
solutions  its also springthe right time for the housing sector and we do need the housing
sector to start bottoming out getting people back into the market  if we push rates down
significantly right now i think many people will start coming off the sidelines because even if
they dont think prices have hit bottom they will probably think interest rates are at an alltime
low and they may want to take advantage of that  so i think its a very good time to be doing
that
i do have concerns that the talf is off to a slow start  when i talk to hedge funds
theyre quite skeptical about how successful that program is going to be  weve been kind of
relying on that as possibly being a successful policy tool  because im a little more skeptical
about either the talf or the publicprivate fund working it calls all the more for more
aggressive policy which is embedded in option a  so i think option a which has both the
treasuries and the mortgagebacked securities is the way to go
chairman bernanke  on the resolution authority board staff has been working
on legislative language and governor tarullo and others are reviewing it  i think frankly that
the congress will be looking to the fed and the treasury to come up with the language because
its a very complex set of issues  and we are working on it  president bullard
mr bullard  i was just going to talk about asset purchases a little bit  what im
concerned about is these oneoff moves and ive been concerned about round numbers
1 trillion 500 billion and so on  i think all of the things that we do in interest rate targeting
should also come in when were doing our assetpurchase program  in interest rate targeting as
it has developed over the last 20 years its all about the whole path of interest rates over a long
horizon in the future  thats all part of the policy  how credible you are about letting the
private sector know how youre going to behave and how youre going to react to things in the
future
when we hit the zero bound that all went out the window  now were taking onetime
actions with the private sector very uncertain about how were going to frame that in the future
and we know that no matter what model you have thats not the right way to do policy  so i
think we want to get back to something like policy paths for asset purchases  even if we dont
say it in our statements the private sector is already imputing what they think thats going to be
they just have bigger confidence bands around it than they would otherwise have  so what i
was going to talk about during the policy goround is somehow to get to where you can
announce continuations of purchases at some rate or something like that  my intuition is that
thats the right way to do these policies instead of saying im going to come in with
500 billion to this particular market on this particular day and i may or may not do any of this
in the future
chairman bernanke  this is why i wanted to hear some of this today  if you
have a specific suggestion you could bring it tomorrow  but i would comment that we have
been pretty clear about what the timeframe is  weve said 500 billion by midyear and the
proposal would be a trillion by the end of the year  so we are effectively giving monthly rates
vice chairman dudley  but then what happens after that is the problem
mr bullard  yes what happens after that  and i think on the treasury purchases
we have vacillated a little  i think as a committee that we want the whole path out there for the
policy tools  also it might be good to indicate a little bit of contingency about buying at a
certain pace for example were looking at the data as they come inif they come in a little
stronger in the fall than we think maybe well tamp down a little bit that kind of thing  thats
what id also have in mind  otherwise you commit all the way to the next year or beyond next
year and it turns out something else happens that you didnt expect
chairman bernanke  the taylor rule and so on emerged essentially from
historical experience  it wasnt ever stated in advance  so thats a problem  we dont really
have a reaction function out there were sort of just starting the rational expectations process
we need a way to think about that and suggestions are welcome
mr bullard  we should feed back the conditions  we dont know what the rule
looks like i agree
chairman bernanke  we could say something like we will continue as long
as or something
mr bullard  were going to monitor conditions  were going to buy at this
pace  we give ourselves the option of buying at a slower pace if things come out better than
expected or something like that
chairman bernanke  okay  i appreciate that and suggestions are welcome
governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me confine my remarks to the largescale
asset purchases  i must admit i am quite uncomfortable with the idea of purchasing longterm
treasuries in size  as the papers described to us the benefits could well be quite small  my
sense is the costs might not be  this is an idea that weve been discussing for a few months and
as i think about the need that we all feel to escalate my sense is it has gotten more attractive now
because we have run out of some very good alternatives
let me highlight some of these concerns  first i think the nature of the treasury market
is frankly quite different from the nature of the gse markets that weve already entertained
and i think id be comfortable entertaining those more  the longterm treasury markets are
functioning reasonably well theyre highly liquid and the desire for riskfree assets is still quite
high  my sense is notwithstanding those facts at this particular moment in time mr chairman
there are serious questions being raised by market participants and market commentators about
the governments ability to fund new higher expected levels of treasury issuancethat is they
may or may not in the markets view be able to find buyers at marketclearing prices  then if
the fed is perceived to be monetizing debt and serving as a buyer of last resort in the name of
lowering riskfree rates we could end up with higher rates and less credibility as a central bank
my own sense is this could be selfdefeating
very recent discussions that nathan sheets and i had with certain large nonus buyers
of treasury securities confirmed these suspicions  they note that at times like this we are one
government and if the treasury and the federal reserve have to collude to somehow solve the
issuance problem it could be signaling greater problems about our ability to fund ourselves  so i
would say my concerns are particularly pronounced at a time like this
now of course all central banks are struggling with arrangements between the fiscal
authorities and the monetary authorities as we are  theres no easy way around it  i think the
accord is certainly a step in the right direction  but i fear that if we are perceived to be colluding
with the treasury around this idea in the name of saving 25 or 30 or 40 basis points in the short
term were running serious risks  even if our actions lowered longterm riskfree rates for a
time and we got a popand i suspect we would get a popit does strike me the spillover
benefits to lower rates on a broader range of securities are likely to be small probably smaller
than the models would suggest  the availability of financing is unlikely to change by virtue of
our actions  our actions dont appear to me to change the universe of institutions or the universe
of assets that are financeable and credit markets would not open to anyone or anything new
the best that could be said is that we are lowering rates on riskier securities by a very small
fraction and that amount is likely to be overwhelmed by daily moves in risk premiums as has
been evidenced in the last few days with costs that as i mentioned could be quite large
with respect to the uk example which has gotten quite a bit of attention overseas i
think theres a little less there than meets the eye  my own sense is this is more a story of
liquidity by virtue of the government entering markets that are considerably less liquid than
treasuries and its also a bit of a story of a much more activist central bank in the uk than the
markets had become accustomed to  so i think thats probably playing some role as well
in light of the choices we have i think it would be preferable at this point to increase our
emphasis on mortgagebacked securities as has been described  i think we could continue to
argue that that is solving a very serious problem which is that market functioning is still more
impaired in that market than we think is ideal  they are wards of the state yet they are trading
as very poor imperfect substitutes for the treasuries  i think that would be a better option to
take at this time  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  about asset purchases i agree we should do
more now  the monetary base has declined by 200 billion in the last couple of months  that
was unanticipated at least on my part and the outlook seems to have worsened  so if anything
we should be moving in the other direction
i have a concern id like to discuss first about how we go about this  we have these
demanddriven credit programs that are having a big influence on the base  weve talked for
two meetings now about different points of view about whether its credit programs and our asset
side or whether its our liability side and the monetary base  weve talked about credit frictions
and weve talked about the demand for bank reserves  i think if were honest with ourselves we
admit that we as a group dont have a clear viewwe havent decided between these two
theories  policy robustness suggests acting as if either could be true  in this instance the two
dont conflict they coincide  both a focus on the base and a focus on the credit programs
suggest we do more now because the economy has weakened in the last couple of months
what that perspective suggests to me is two things  first that in the materials we
distribute before the meeting this is something i have discussed with our secretary its hard for
me to evaluate alternatives that differ in the size of one program on our balance sheetthe
somawithout having a sense of whats happening to the rest of our balance sheet  theres a
substantial amount of uncertainty about the talf about the cpff rolling off and so on  it
would make more sense at least to me for us to evaluate alternatives in terms of where the base
is going to be  and this perspective of thinking that the base matters is one that leads me to think
that maybe we should specify policy in terms of the base
the second implication that it suggests to me is that we might want to direct the desk to
ensure that the base does at least somethingthat it at least achieves a certain level or that it
doesnt go down in the intermeeting period  we could set an objective and say by the next
meeting the base goes up by at least x  such a line in the directive wouldnt conflict with any
credit programs but it would direct the desk to offset any unanticipated falls in the base due to a
running off of the credit programs  this is something id like to see us consider and talk about
tomorrow
more broadly i like president bullards ideaand i think thats the way we ought to
think about thisthat weve got to vary what we plan to do with the base in response to
economic conditions as in a sort of a reaction function  i think were kind of groping toward
this  what the new york staff did in forecasting the base is a great start but its a little hard to
get a handle on such a large aggregate number so far ahead  im not looking for daily or weekly
forecasts of the basethat would be a little overkill  but something with a bit more granularity
on the time scale might be useful  i recognize theres a lot of uncertainty about what these other
contributors to fluctuations in the base are going to do in the near term and we ought to take that
into account  but i think setting a floor for the path for the base in the near term has some
usefulness to it
about mortgagebacked securities versus treasuries i have a preference for treasuries
the reason is twofold  i was asking ms mosser about flexibility and i thought that maybe
intervening in treasuries would be a little more flexible than in agencies  but more broadly i
worry about the exit problem and i worry about the optics of a situation in which when the
recovery begins were holding a huge portion of the fannie mae and freddie mac securities
and were contemplating selling it off in order to tighten monetary policy  i worry about what
elected political officials will have to say about that and what pressure they might bring to bear
on us to forestall selling off a big agency portfolio  i think wed face much less pressure with
regard to treasuries appealing as we would to the 1951 accord
about fx swaps i have very mixed feelings for live institutions  im very concerned
that the presence of it which the banks would obviously come to be aware of would diminish
their incentive to inoculate themselves against the circumstances that would give rise to their
need for it despite the best efforts of our supervisory staff to ensure they pursue those
inoculations  i think case 3 is persuasive in conjunction with the closedown or windup of a large
institution  so im willing to reluctantly support it  i think we ought to be transparent about it
as president rosengren said
about an accord what youve outlined is not my ideal accord  i dont think that the
creditriskfree line youve sketched is a bright one  i think that the price that were paying is
pretty high in terms of using the talf to fund what in early february was announced as
something that would be funded by the fdic  bank rescues i think are worthwhile buying
toxic assets is very worthwhile  i think its very important that it gets done  something clean
and simple and uncomplicated has much to recommend it so i find myself supporting president
rosengren on this for some straightforward program
at the last meeting we talked a lot about the talf  i wont rehearse the things i said
then about it but ill note now that to some extent what were doing is recreating leverage  i
thought that theres at least a case that a lot of what went wrong in the last decade was excessive
leverage  and if you think toobigtofail is a problem its a problem because it leads to
excessive leverage  we seem to be trying to restore the status quo ex ante conditions in credit
markets by restoring the same extent of leverage and im not sure that thats the right
philosophy  im not sure that we can have a lot of confidence about the incentives of the private
participants in the partnership  are their incentives going to be to price it cleanly or to overpay
because they have the downside put to us  im not sure i see analytically how that works out
id like to get rid of the ring fences very soon  i think new york has executed theirs  we
in richmond have not executed ours  if theres any chance of relieving us of having to execute
that legal document id really appreciate it  laughter  but im not getting my hopes up
obviously  i take it that this would require congressional action to authorize the treasury to take
this
about fed bills i agree with president plosser that its something that would weaken our
ability in the future to resist entreaties to provide funding for something that the administration
would rather not go to the congress for  this is not a comment on our current political
independence  im confident that youve undertaken everything that we have discussed in
making a full independent judgment about what was worthwhile for the federal reserve  i just
worry about future political leaders and the situation we could find ourselves in one day
about resolution techniques it has always struck me that there are two things that get
talked about there in one bundle  one is technical legal provisions of conservatorship authority
and the laws around resolving them and the other is funding  we have a model that works with
banks and the funding of that is pretty transparent  id rather not get us involved in similar
resolution funding for some other types of institutions  let me just point out that the original
accord gave us independent control over our balance sheet and im not sure this really restores
that  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman let me give my comments on expanding our balance sheet
by first saying that i agree with those who have said and i think you have said that we cannot
get the economy going until we get the banking and intermediation process fixed  and i think
thats an important premise for going forward  that means we need to focus on resolution and i
think this proposal thats being worked on using the talf and using us to help finance a bad
bank is actually going to delay dealing with this very serious problem  given the comments that
president rosengren and others have made i think we have an opportunity to get this done with
some legislation that would create the ability to put some of these holding companies in
receivership and move forward so that we can get the banking system fixed on a sustained basis
i think thats important because i am very concerned about the talf and growing our
balance sheet even at this meeting  i think we should pause because we have the taf we have
other means to provide liquidity should it be needed and we have excess reserves that are
sizable  i think we should focus on fixing the banking system and conserve our balance sheet
carefully  i wouldnt want it necessarily to decline dramatically but i dont think it would with
the taf and so forth we have the mechanisms to provide liquidity
but if the majority decides to go forward with it then i do prefer mortgagebackeds to
treasuries  i disagree in a sense with president lacker because i think it would just open us up
to charges of monetizing treasury debt  and my experience is that it doesnt matter if youre
holding mortgagebackeds or treasuries when you try to sell them off your balance sheet
interest rates go upit doesnt matter people are going to be upset  so were better off with
mortgagebackeds because it makes a cleaner line for us to say we are not in that business
i also want to talk about excess reserves and fed bills  i think that as the banking
industry itself has learned about excess reserves and the payment of interest it is learning to
arbitrage  from a governance point of view and from a simplicity point of view going forward
if the fomc were made the party responsible for setting the interest rate on excess reserves we
would set the floor and control the fed funds rate  you dont need fed bills if in fact the
banking industry has learned how to arbitrage it  i agree with president plossergetting us into
issuing bills or in a socalled cooperative relationship with the treasury where were taking
treasury bills is a very tenuous path for us to go down and id stay away from it  i think paying
interest on excess reserves would go a long ways to managing our balance sheet or i should say
our ability to control the fed funds rate
on the swaps i understand where theyre coming from on that and i take that pretty
much as a given but hopefully it will be carefully managed and not easily accessed by the
institution that needs it  thank you
chairman bernanke  on the interest rate on excess reserves i think its coming
to play the same role as the discount rate  if the fomc set a target for the federal funds rate that
would essentially determine where the interest rate on excess reserves would be analogous to the
discount rate  i think that analogy will hold up pretty well in the future  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i want to comment on the additional asset purchases
principally  i fully agree with governor warshin fact i think he understated the case and that
is that i dont think its advisable to purchase treasuries here  ive sent a note around about that
for the record i just want to repeat some of the arguments in there  to my knowledge there is
no liquidity problem in the treasury market  there are no obvious signs of a breakdown in
arbitrage across maturities unless trish tells us differently  the spreads between highgrade
private issues and treasuries do indicate that the markets are not functioning normallyi take
that for granted and you can see it every daybut that doesnt mean that lowering longterm
treasury rates will affect private sector rates  i do worry about the perceptionand its
palpablethat we will be succumbing to political pressure to monetize the exploding borrowing
needs of the treasury  trish you gave us some numbers todayif i add them correctly for the
fiscal year 2009 its around 2 trillion  its an inordinately large number  im preparing for a
trip i am about to make to asia and i do think that theres a lot of sensitivity about this there
im not sure if that is whom you were referring to in your reference governor warsh  if we
are viewed as the handmaiden of the treasury here i believe you might have a negative reaction
not a positive reaction  if the majority decides in favor of increased purchases i support
respecting president hoenigs view  i would prefer that we purchase gse securitiesthe
number is somewhat arbitrary bill as you pointed out  i would do it by size or at least
announce that we could go up to a size  the one thing i would caution against is giving a
specific date unless we are absolutely certain we can meet that date
i want to make a general point here  there is a lack of confidence in the marketplace
there was reference to that before we see it with everybody we talk to  confidence is a function
of competence and i think we should exercise our muscle where we have proven ourselves quite
competent  we have proven ourselves quite competent for example in the commercial paper
market and we are proving ourselves quite competent in the mortgagebacked securities market
theres a question mark out there on the talfwere not quite sure  and its not because the
staff isnt making a great effortwere just going through this new process and it has become
enormously complicated  i want to play to our comparative advantage  no question we could
buy treasuriesi dont think thats the issuebut i disagree with that for other reasons  but i
would support an expanded program on mortgagebacked securities because we are competent
in performing in that area
on the issue of the swap lines i agree with the comment that this is procedural  i think
we have to be very clear in expressing this  i do worry that it may become quite evident to some
that were doing this for one particular institution and i think you could have retribution in terms
of price reaction visvis that institution and the rumors about others  but as long as we keep
that in mind and express it clearly then were i a voter i would vote to proceed
on the issue of fed bills and special treasury issuance initially i indicated that i would
be against the issuance of fed bills  im somewhat more enlightened now that the maturity that
you described is in terms of one year or less  i have been worried that a cds market would
develop around the fed which would be a negative development particularly if there was a long
maturity  i still have doubts about the concept  im not as clear in my own mind as president
hoenig just expressed as to the alternative but i do worry about the eventual assumption that we
might grow that program rather than rein it back in  therefore if we were to proceed with
issuing fed bills or an alternative i would want to have a clear sense of provision  otherwise i
think the expectation would be that we would continue to expand the program and therefore
give rise to these doubts about the further purchase of treasuries  thank you
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me just comment on three or maybe four
issues  first with regard to asset purchases i dont have a conviction about the magnitudes but
i would diversify the purchases by adding treasuries  i suspect that the preponderance of our
purchases would still be mortgagebacked securities but both because it puts us in a better
position when it comes time to unwind and because it may turn out to be effective i would
certainly start to purchase longterm treasuries  im not worriedi could be dead wrong about
thisabout great concerns about collusion or funding exploding federal debt  these are unusual
and exigent circumstances  people would understand what the intent of the program is in my
judgment
with regard to the talfas initially described i thought and i think it has some
promise  the way i saw it you have some markets that are not workingthere are no prices
one of the things we learned from the japanese experience the depression of the 30s and some
other episodes is that you need to have resource reallocation occur  weve got to move
resources from places where theyre no longer needed to where they are needed and you cant
have that happen without prices  so we need to get those markets restarted and im in favor of
the talf as described  i would stay away from legacy talf funding the bad bank is a close
cousin to being the bad bank  thats the job of the congress and the administration and of
course theyre not going to be quick to pick that up if were willing to do it  but it seems to me
weve got to make a stand somewhere with regard to this and this seems to me to be a very clear
and direct place where we ought to do that
finally with regard to fed bills or sfp what troubles me about that is that from one
perspective it could be viewed as circumventing the debt ceiling and i dont think we want to
put ourselves in that position  if we say to the congress understand that this is one of the
effects of passing this legislation so that everything is on the table then im not troubled by it
but if were not that transparent then i would also stay away from that
chairman bernanke  the legislation explicitly says it  it makes no sense to have
the sfp in particular if its subject to the debt ceiling because then we would not be able to use
it
mr stern  okay  so long as thats understood
chairman bernanke  yes  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i have a few brief comments on the various
issues  starting with the swaps i support the staff recommendation  i think its a prudent step
there were two possible draft resolutions  i think i would favor the greater transparency of a
but i dont feel strongly about it and could support either
then just a brief comment on the banking system  i think its essential to fix the banking
system for exactly the reason that president hoenig and others emphasized  i think we will not
get recovery until we have a strong healthy banking system with good banks that can attract
capital  i would really love to see this done in the most transparent and straightforward way
namely creating a good bankbad bank type of framework  i agree fully with president
rosengrens commentsi would not make this a matter of optional sales of some portfolios of
assets by banks that wanted to do it into a facility  i would go in and much more aggressively as
he suggested force writedowns on the value of these assets  we have a great opportunity to do
it after the stress test is over and i would push these institutions into spinning off their
operations in the cases where it is needed into a good bankbad bank structure  if we had
legislation that allowed for the resolution of systemically important financial firms that arent
banks that would be much easierto give us the power to push firms without necessarily having
to put them into a conservatorship but to take those steps  so thats what i think would be ideal
and i think its important for economic recovery  i understand its expensive and i understand
its hard to go to the congress to get the amount of capital thats needed  i think the fdic
facility is a move in the right direction  i prefer it to what were doing now  its not ideal but i
think its a step in the right direction
on the legacy talf i have issues similar to those that president stern enunciated  im
not dead set against it but i do have qualms about our becoming involved in that business
on the purchase options i certainly see the benefits of additional purchases of mbs
especially given that theres going to be a stepup in issuance over the next couple of months in
connection with refinancing of mortgages  the spreads are still high although theyve come
down and it seems to me that the expansion of that program could have a beneficial effect on the
housing market and the economy and on bringing longterm yields down more generally since
other longterm assets are substitutes for mortgagebacked securities  i worry a little bit that
theyre harder to unwind than treasuries but still its something that i would be very
supportive of going ahead with now  bill mentioned a number much higher than i had
envisioned  i dont know what the right number is so im quite open on that  i would be
supportive of going ahead with purchases of treasuries at this point as well on various grounds
one is that the economy is just a disaster area  the economic outlook is utterly dreadful and we
have said we stand ready to do absolutely everything thats needed to support the economy  we
have let some time pass without doing anything and in light of the outlook i would want to do
everything we can  i thought the staff memos made a good case for the idea that the treasuries
and mbs purchases would have favorable macro effects and i understand the concern about
what are we doing monetizing the debt  thats quite a legitimate concern but on balance i
come out in the same place as president sterni dont think weve lost our independence i
think people realize these are unusual and exigent circumstances and taking a step like that now
is a favorable thing for the economy  so i am supportive of a and am very openminded about
magnitudes
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  let me hit some of these subjects as well
were in a position where doing the right thing is not obvious  were in a second third or
fourthbest situation and i think weve got to make the best of what were doing given all of the
constraints  it puts us in a very difficult situation
i would include the swaps in that  i would be in favor of going ahead because i think we
need to have this in our arsenal  but i do worry about the announcement effect and whether as
several people have pointed out markets will figure out this is really about one institution
otherwise why are we doing this now  we dont have the situation we had when we put the
other swaps into play in which there was generalized pressure on the markets  so i guess the
head of your transparency subcommittee is for being a little less transparent  laughter  i could
go either way on it but i would prefer alternative b in that case just to downplay it a little more
because of the announcement effects  i think we need to put it into play either way
on the fed bills and sfp i wish i believed that the rate on excess reserves would work
but i dont and i think weve seen evidence that it doesnt work  banks are capitalconstrained
and all of us are talking about further substantial increases in our balance sheet  some people are
concerned about whether those increases in the balance sheet and in effect monetizing the debt
will have inflationary effects and im concerned that all of these assets end up being excess
reserves in a banking system thats capitalconstrained and i know theres no risk weight on
these reserves but they are part of the leverage ratio  i think having fed bills or sfp will
alleviate those concerns and will reduce some of the constraints on our actions now because it
will take the funding of those actions outside the banking system and will give us a clear
framework for an exit when we need to exit  so im strongly in favor of pursuing those  i
recognize the political potential here but i think in this situation thats a lesser risk than the risk
that we dont do everything that we should be doing because were worried about the exit
on legacy assets i agree that a clean simple program would be much better than these
three complicated interrelated things that are hard to explain  you did a great job mr
chairman but its hard to understand how they relate to each other  i think were hung up on
two issues  one is pricing the assets for a going concern  this is unlike the sls where the
rtc just got the assets because the sls collapsed  all the rtc had to do was worry about
auctioning them into the market  now weve got to worry about the price at which were taking
them from banks that are going concerns and partly because we dont have a resolution regime
from bank holding companies that are going concerns  so we really have no choicewe dont
have a legal way of putting them out of business in a controlled kind of way  related to that is
the second issue the amount of tarp capital available  when we write these assets down its
going to leave huge holes in the balance sheets of some banks and theres the tarp capital
constraint  i wish neither of these were constraints but they are  so i think given those
constraints we should probably go ahead with the legacy talf as long as the total talf
doesnt go over that 1 trillion mark
on asset purchases i agree with the others who have said the economy is very weak
this is a serious situation  its not obvious that the talf and these other indirect ways are
having that big an effecti think theyll have some effect  what we do know is that direct
purchases of assets from the market have been very effective in the commercial paper area and in
the mbs area  where we do not fool around with all of the indirect spvs we can have an
effect and we need to do that  apologies to bill nelsonhes doing a great job  but it would
be much easier if we just bought the securities even at market prices rather than going through
all of this circular financing  particularly with the constraint on the funds rate at the zero bound
we need to use all of our tools and asset purchases are the most effective tool we have right now
so i would definitely buy some more mbs  like president yellen im not sure exactly what
amount but i would certainly at least continue at the current rate you were talking about mr
chairman
but i would buy treasuries also  it really concerned me over the intermeeting period that
there was this generalized tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy was
weak  among the things that tightened was the riskfree rate and corporate rates went up pari
passu more or less with the riskfree rate  having seen treasury rates rise while the economy
was sinking was a very troublesome thing to me  it felt like financial conditions were tightening
at exactly the wrong time  so i think we need to lean against that tendency in a very visible
transparent way  i think buying longerterm treasuries is the way to do that  i think it will work
in the sense of lowering interest rates  i think the table that joe showed us was telling where all
of these announcements have had the expected effects on interest ratesits not basis point for
basis point  like president plosser im a little surprised that these announcements would have
that effect given that the markets are very very liquid  but thats what the data show  also in
every case the exchange rate moved in the expected direction  so buying treasury bonds would
not only lower treasury and corporate rates but i think it also would take some of the pressure
off the appreciation of the dollar which has been part of the tightening of financial conditions  i
think the treasury will issue securities across the maturity spectrum because theyre concerned
about their debt management over the long run  so in effect i think by buying treasury debt
were financing the deficit with either reserves or fed bills  were changing the relative supply
of long and shortterm assets and thats one of the limited tools we have when the federal funds
rate is at the zero bound  i think we ought to be using that tool  i think right now we need to
make sure that fiscal policy is as effective as it can be  so monetizing the debt to me is not a
negative under the current situation because its helping fiscal policy be effectiveprovided we
can do it in the context of not having rising inflation expectations and not having concerns about
our independence  i think these announcements havent had an adverse effect on peoples
perceptions of our independence  in the context of pursuing a framework for fed bills and
sfpso were actively thinking about the exit strategy at the same time were buying the
bondsand in the context of our longerterm projections and strengthening what we say about
inflation expectations i think we can buy the bonds without concerns about raising inflation
expectations  the program will underline in a very visible way our expectation that interest rates
are going to be low for a while  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thanks  vice chairman did you have a twohander
vice chairman dudley  i just had a question about the liquidity of the treasury
market  people have said a couple of times that the treasury market is really liquid  i dont
really think its all that liquid  trish did you have a comment
ms mosser  its more liquid than anything else  laughter  but thats a pretty sad
statement at this stage  there are in fact huge price gaps between the different pieces of the
treasury curve  one of the things we do by going in is actually to improve liquidity particularly
at the long end and hopefully help to bring down yields that way as well  it is interestingand
this is a point i made in my presentationthat our presence in the mortgagebacked securities
market particularly the large presence in the tba market which is the forward liquid part of the
market has improved liquidity tremendously according to the asset managers weve been using
i think our buying treasuries would hopefully have some effect there too
mr fisher  can i ask a question about that mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  the 10year rate has sort of altered between 270 and 300 percent  is that
correct
ms mosser  yes
mr fisher  and when we talk about buying treasuries to bring rates down give me
an order of magnitude  are we talking about going back to 270  are we talking about 250
lets say we did something in size  what would your expectations be just so we have a
reference point for this discussion
ms mosser  it partly depends on where we would buy  i dont want to get too
technical here but i think wed probably start not with the rates you see every daythe onthe
runswed probably start with the offtheruns where we can improve liquidity  normally as
the offtheruns come down part of that would be the spread to the ontheruns that would come
down as wellhopefully its low
we would move across the curve  i think the strategywhich were in the process of
working out because we werent so sure that we were going to be doing thiswould be to start
there but to go to recently issued securities where theres a little bit of liquidity but not a lot  in
terms of the size of the effect honestly i dont think we have any better estimates than the ones
that joe gave you  were guessing there would be a very large announcement effect of the order
of magnitude that joe said  once we got goinglets say its 500 billion and people figure out
how much per week approximately we were going to dowed move back and forth across the
curve  we would announce in advance approximately over a course of weeks what tenors of the
curve we would be buyingnot exact days and exact amounts because we dont want to get
frontrun that badly but wed want to give folks a sense of where we were going  if we thought
there were particular distortions in one part of the curve we would focus more there  so were
doing something somewhat analogous to the way we are managing the mbs program  we dont
have an explicit target but when both retail rates get high and mortgage spreads get high the
investment managers know to buy more and we would take the same approach
mr fisher  but we would expect wed still have a positiveshaped yield curve
obviously
ms mosser  absolutely
mr fisher  it would still be fairly steep
ms mosser  absolutely  it would still be steep but not as steep as it is now
mr fisher  if my memory is correct it does help bankers to have a positive
relationship  thank you
ms mosser  yes and its typical
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  id like to ask what you mean by improved liquidity in this context
because we use that term a lot  theres a market there are some sales theres a bid and theres
an asked theres a certain flow  we come in and we buy a lot  that increases the volume  then
afterwards the price is presumably higher  when you say liquidity is improved do you mean
theres increased the volume because we added volume by purchasing a bunch or do you mean
the bidasked spreads are lower  or do you mean the price is higher
ms mosser  bidasked spreads trade depth how much size of a trade you could put
through how easy it is to hedge
mr lacker  so even apart from our volume other peoples volume is higher
ms mosser  correct  we want other people to follow us in  our volume alone is not
going to do it  thats clear  if others dont follow us in it wont work  whats interesting about
the mbs market is that volumes were low bidaskeds were very wide and daily price volatility
bounced all over the place  so if you actually wanted to sell any mortgages it was very hard to
figure out where they were going to price  what has happened since we have come in is that
others have come in after us because our managers add a little stabilityif the price gets too
high they buy a little more that day they buy less if its a little low  so they temper their
purchases on a daytoday basis  i dont know if wed do it literally day to day for treasuries
but we would do it over time
vice chairman dudley  think about it as  volatility comes down therefore the
risk premiums will come down as a function of lower volatility  and thats what brings rates
down
chairman bernanke  okay  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  given the deterioration in the outlook i
do believe that aggressive policy action is needed  i came to the meeting prepared to support
alternative b primarily because the simulations that the staff provided indicated that purchasing
mortgagebacked securities gave us a bigger bang for our buck than the purchase of treasury
securities  however i am willing to consider the purchase of treasury securities  i listened to
vice chairman dudleys comments about the fact that the talf is slow to get up and running
and that we dont have experience in the purchase of longterm treasury securities  so i do
support the expansion of the purchase of mortgagebacked securities and the increase in agency
debt purchases but i am also willing to be openminded about the purchase of treasury
securities  regarding the extension of the talf i am concerned that we are not being clear
about our objectives  some of the questions we had around the table today indicate that  so i
dont want our periodic announcement of additional classes of securities to be interpreted as if
we are just being reactive  i think that if we do move ahead with the expansion of the program
then making our objectives clearer will help the public understanding and help build confidence
around the program  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  there are two sorts of questions id like to
address and tell you where i think i am and where i might be tomorrow or the next day after that
the questions are first of all the expansion of the balance sheet  should it be bigger than it is
im not opposed to expanding the balance sheet  ive never expressed much opposition to it
whats not clear to me is whether we have the right set of metrics to help us judge how much
expansion we need and what the right tradeoffs are as we do it  in that regard before i go any
further i want to thank the staff  ive been raising some of these questions off and on  the new
york staff and the board staff have presented an incredible set of memos for us this time and i
just want to thank them a lot for their efforts  theyre really working hard to try to address these
questions which are very challenging because they do not have easy answers  its much easier
to ask them than it is answer them and i appreciate that fact  i do think though that we need
some better metrics to think about what it means to expand the balance sheet  im very
sympathetic to president lackers view that maybe we ought to think about whats the size of the
monetary base or the size of the balance sheet and set some bounds on it and how we think of
measuring that  improving on metrics in that regard would be very useful  also in terms of the
size of the balance sheet thinking about why it ought to be bigger or smaller and what the
appropriate magnitudes would be may help us think about what the composition of that balance
sheet is going to look like  so i think we need to think about the size first of all
the second issue is if we agree to increase the balance sheet to whatever size we want it
to be then we need to think about its composition  should the increase be in treasuries  should
it be in mortgagebacked securities  should it be more talf  and here im a little frustrated
because i find myself as ive said before worried about credit programs and fiscal policy issues
and other things  but even stepping away from that it seems to me that we do these various
programs on almost a oneoff basis  i think one of the challenges we face is getting some grasp
of how these programs are benefiting us at the margin  were always taught that you do things
at the margin  so you want to equate the marginal benefits of the different programs that were
trying to be involved in regardless of our debates on other points about them
one of the things that i think we should also think hard about is how the different
programs interact with each other  i raised the question last time when we talked about
extending them whether maybe we could get rid of some of them whether maybe theyre not
doing what we thought they would do  how does the commercial paper program interact with
the treasurys guarantee program which interacts with the amlf which interacts with the
mmiff  in trying to get as i think the chairman said last time some rationalization of these
programs id ask where at the margin were trying to get some benefit from each of these and
how do we equate them across that
i worry a little about the consequences of our pursuing programs where we become the
lender of first resort rather than the lender of last resort  one of the things we want is to have our
benefits spread across or marginally equated across programs  but i worry about the
consequences of our participation in some markets where we either are the market or were
making ourselves the market by what we do  i think thats something that we have to be
concerned about  we have to worry about the anticipation that other players wont be in the
market as long as were there  looking a bit beyond just the direct impact  are we
discouraging participation  are we trying to revive markets that maybe shouldnt be revived
indeed by trying to keep certain specific markets in place are we impeding the marketplaces
search for other creditallocation or capitalraising mechanisms  so i think we have to worry
about the endogeneity of the performance of these markets with respect to the decisions and
plans we make
that brings me back to president bullards point about having a plan and having a path  i
think its very important and it interacts with this notion of the degree to which were creating
problems for markets or solving problems in some of these markets  not knowing what our path
of actions is going to be over the future i think is a source of uncertainty in the marketplace
the way i think about it is by trying to get to answers for questions like  what do we think the
size of our balance sheet ought to be or what should its path be  how do we equate the marginal
benefits from each of these programs to achieving that growth knowing full well that if we dont
articulate what our strategy is and how were going to end when we enter markets then we can
actually increase uncertainty and volatility rather than reduce it  we have to think about those
choices
how does that play against the talf and treasury bills  if were going to expand our
balance sheetand again im not convinced that we need to but im not necessarily opposed to
iti do lean towards treasury bills for a couple of reasons  i worry about the knockon effects
that i was just alluding to about talf programs at the margin and the various other programs
that we have  im uncomfortable with not having more treasuries on our balance sheet i think
treasuries would help our exit strategy at the end of the day  my view of buying treasuries
though is really about the composition of our balance sheet and not about trying to drive down
longterm treasury rates  of course in this environment where its essentially a zero interest
rate bound buying shortterm treasuries is sort of a swap and economic theory tells us thats
not going to help us very much  so we end up being forced into buying longerterm assets  but
my first concern is getting a better balance of treasuries versus all this other stuff on our balance
sheet  so id be inclined in favor of buying treasuries  it doesnt mean id be opposed to
buying more mbs at some point in the future but we havent gotten to the 500 billion level yet
and we havent articulated a path  so id wait until we got a plan together to articulate this path
before we announced additional purchases of those types of assets
like president stern im not a big fan of doing the legacy abs through the talf  ill
treat the bad bank model separately  but expanding the talf to legacy stuff is going a little too
far  again i worry about us becoming the lender of first resort and im just not sure thats
where we want to be
on the bad bankgood bankpresident stern made this pointim not sure that ought to
be our business or that we ought to be funding it  i think that should be a treasury issue and if
we can avoid being in that business i would prefer it
chairman bernanke  were not funding the bad bank
mr plosser  but were taking on the assets in support and providing the liquidity
through the talf to do that  id rather let the fdic program work than have us augment it
but let me move on to the other two issues  on the resolution mechanism mr chairman
i think youve been very clear about it in fact people in this room myself included have been
talking about this for almost a year  we need to get on with that and its very critical  i think
thats going to help us a lot so i support that effort
as to the accord i shared a memo about it with the committee  my views there are
pretty clear  they really havent changed  i do think that its important that the accord as i
proposed it be about keeping our balance sheet much more pristine and about the exit  it had its
antecedents in al broadduss and marvin goodfriends work and even was a recommendation of
the financial stability group of the g30
but i do think that its a form of constrained discretion  if we dont want to be in the
business of doing fiscal policy and we want to discourage the congress from coming to us to
engage in fiscal policy then we want to make it easier for us to say no in those circumstances
i think mr chairman youve done a terrific job in this in the example of the congress talking
about funding the automobile companies you were very clear that that was not our business  we
want to discourage those kinds of requests and my concern is raising the threshold for saying
yes  what worries me about the fed bills option as opposed to the supplemental financing
securities is that the fed bills option is going to make it easier for them to ask us to do things  i
think of it as giving us an almost incredibly unconstrained discretion to do fiscal policy or to be
asked to do fiscal policy  and that may ultimately become a lack of independence not a source
of independence  that worries me because at some point down the roadmaybe ten years
fifteen years whateverif the federal reserve became more politicized than it has been in the
past it might be much more susceptible or much more responsive to a claim that we have to
coordinate monetary and fiscal policies and therefore federal reserve you should issue some
treasury bills on our behalf and do some things to help coordinate policies  that probability
may not be large but it would be a very bad outcome for the institution and i think we should do
all we can to resist being in that spot  the sunset provision mr chairman as you suggested
may provide us some protection against that but if the sunset provision comes along and weve
issued fed bills in the past then it might be easy for them to want us to do it again  so my
current feeling is if i cannot get a true accord as i advocated in my memo id prefer the
supplemental financing program to be conducted as needed  if we think we need that
sterilization capability id rather go that route  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  the time is late and in the interest of
time and in response to the body language i see around the room im going to limit myself to
talking about the assetpurchase question  i came here favoring growing the balance sheet with
more asset purchases principally because of the deteriorating outlook  a lot of good arguments
have been made on both sides whether it be treasuries or an mbs program  i on balance favor
the mbs approach for reasons a number of you have articulated particularly governor warsh
but i would like to focus my remarks on a dimension that has been touched on but perhaps not
explicitly addressed and thats the communications challenges  in lots of conversations over the
last few weeks particularly with directors and so forth i get the increasing sense that we have
big communication challenges and they are part of the problem  theres a lot of confusion and
uncertainty regarding how were making our decisions what comes next and how it all fits
together as a total policy set
i think we need to consider favoring programs that are already in place  simplicity i
think counts in these circumstances  i would argue that it may be better to err on the side of no
new stuff if we can to be as concrete as we can to try to explain the decision framework that
we are using and to try to repeat a holistic explanation of policy going forward  so i think a
consideration in the decision is the question of communication  president fisher used the term
confidence  president bullard talked about path  president plosser used the word
uncertainty  this all comes together to me as one more element to take into consideration
which is  how do we communicate it clearly so the public particularly the business public
understands
chairman bernanke  for those who have talked about rates would expressing
purchases in terms of monthly rates be of any help  i havent yet heard a specific suggestion
about how to do that  something like say the desk will aim to buy 80 billion a month of
mortgagebacked securities
vice chairman dudley  youd want it conditional on the financial conditions  in
other words if things got worse youd want to accelerate the rate and similarly if things got
better
chairman bernanke  im looking for a concrete example  id be more than
happy to try to accommodate this kind of language if we can figure out how to do it  brian is
already worried about missing dinner im sure  laughter
vice chairman dudley  hes worried about missing going to bed today
laughter
mr lockhart  let me think about the question overnight and ill come back with
an answer tomorrow
chairman bernanke  okay good  well discuss that in the morning  governor
tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  mindful of the fact that im now the major
impediment between the federal open market committee and dinner i will follow president
lockharts lead and confine myself to comments on the largescale assetpurchase issue  but
could i ask trish a couple of quick questions beforehand  one trish you said earlier something
about the equivalent of absorption capacity or i guess its actually going in the other direction
the effective limit on mbs purchases
ms mosser  and the number wasthis is our best guessan additional 2 trillion of
mortgagebacked securities that might strain it
mr tarullo  okay  second you were working with the half trillion figure for
government securities which had been put in the bluebook  is there a minimum figure below
which a palpable impact wouldnt be felt
ms mosser  thats a very hard question to answer  i am concerned that a very small
quantity would be seen as ineffective and part of this is about the announcement effect not to
mention the liquidity effect  could it be less than 500 billion yes  we calculated about how
much we would have to buy every week and wed go in two or three times a week with several
billion dollars every time  so these would be sizable transactions from our perspective  it could
be scaled back a bit but i wouldnt want to put it at 100 billion or 200 billion not over a nine
month period  im afraid it wouldnt be effective
mr tarullo  okay  thanks  so somewhat informed by those helpful answers here
are my views as they now stand  first it seems to me that under current circumstances for the
reasons many of you have stated the risks for us are in doing too little not in doing too much
that leads me to the predisposition towards a large figure at least as large as the option a total
that was included in the bluebook and as vice chairman dudley has suggested perhaps larger
than that as well  second it seems to me with respect to the issue of the proper numberhow
do we know where we are going how do we know how much is enoughyou all have for some
time been and now im joining you navigating in waters in which theres not a particularly good
map to follow so its necessarily a matter of making judgments based upon what appear to be
still seriously dysfunctional credit markets and a serious absence of liquidity and a seriously
underperforming real economy  in those circumstances i feel pushed towards the larger end of
the ranges that have been identified as appropriate  third for the reason that president evans
stated earlier in the afternoon my inclination is towards multiple instruments  ive been struck
just in my first six weeks here how many times people have commented that correlations or
predictions that people might have expected in normal times are now breaking down a bit
were not entirely sure of the effects of the application of a particular policy instrument and it
seems to me that under those circumstances it would be wise to mix instruments that are
essentially directed towards the same end  having said that my instinct if it is possibleand
this is why i asked trish the question about minimum purchases of government securitiesis for
an asymmetric number and an asymmetric emphasis upon the mbs rather than the treasury
securities  here id echoor stealsome of the points that vice chairman dudley made a
moment ago
finally on communications i have a slightly different but i think complementary point
to the one that president lockhart made  if we go this route of including both mbs and
treasuries i hope we could at least consider giving some explanation in the committees
statement about why were pursuing both rather than simply stating here is the amount of each
which weve instructed the desk to purchase  thank you
chairman bernanke  thanks  governor duke
ms duke  now im the one standing in the way of dinner  i just want to talk a bit
about expansion of the talf and then also about asset purchases  in terms of expanding the
talf my concern is about some of the asset classes for instance commercialmortgagebacked
securities  i dont know a lot about how those are put together but i do know a lot about
commercial mortgages and theyre much closer to business loans than they are to real estate
loans  theyre entirely dependent on cash flows of different types of businesses  so if we get
into those kinds of purchases and we start to determine the haircuts were going to be looking at
credit allocation because were going to be looking at differences in conditions in different
industries and the real estate that supports those industries
the second thing is that i dont think you can make a bad asset into a good one by taking
a larger haircut  if were going to be taking assets not from banks but from anybody who wants
to disgorge them then what would keep us from simply moving assets from one hedge fund to
another  and i really get concerned that the fed ends up getting stuck trying to digest every
hairball thats out there in the marketplace  laughter  thats a technical term hairball
i also worry that when we originally talked about expanding the talf up to 1 trillion it
was with the understanding that that was conditional upon our getting the ability to issue either
fed bills or the supplemental treasury securities  that has gotten lost in the discussion of it and
i worry that with a quick announcement on this other facility the notion would again get lost
namely that its dependent upon other things happening
finally i dont see this as a good bankbad bank situation and i worry whether wed
have enough left to deal with emergencies if they came up  ill talk more about this tomorrow
but the more i keep going around and around considering all the things were trying to do to fix
the banking systemwhile i think its importantim not nearly as confident as everyone else
that its something that we can do  so i keep coming back to thinking that the only thing we can
do is to put a floor under house prices  if we could put a floor under house prices that would
also put a floor under bank losses and i think its our best chance to get moving in the right
direction
before i move to asset purchases id like to start with the story of an elderly wealthy
gentleman who had taken a young bride and begun to spend money like crazy  his friends got
very concerned that he was going to go through his entire fortune and they elected one of their
number to go and talk to him about it  he said sam were really concerned  we want to make
sure that you know that you cant buy love  sam said i know you cant buy love but if you
spend enough money you can buy something that looks so close you can hardly tell the
difference  laughter  so i think if we spent enough money got enough of a hit right now it
would look like a floor on house prices and we might have something every bit as good as a
floor on house prices  it seems like the best time when we have the synergies with the housing
program which should reduce foreclosures and should increase the ability to refinance  both
borrowers and purchasers are so incredibly hairtrigger sensitive to what goes on with mortgage
interest rates  mortgage interest rates went down when we made the announcement before but
that was in november and that was not the season when people buy houses  if we do this in the
spring when there are other programs that would support it and when its pretty obvious that
theres not going to be any fiscal stimulus coming along that would also further support house
purchases then maybe weve got a window of opportunity where we can go in there and put a
floor under house prices and that will start to move some of these other things  and with that
mr chairman i believe im the last one
chairman bernanke  well im certainly glad we avoided a goround  laughter
before we leave we have a little bit of business  we have to ratify domestic open market
operations
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  we do have to vote on the
temporary liquidity swap lines  i heard most people proposing a which was the more
transparent alternative understanding that there were perhaps some risks to that  governor
kohn are you okay with that
mr kohn  sure
chairman bernanke  all right  would anyone else like to speak on that
question  no response  if not do you want to take the roll on the swap lines
ms danker  okay  on resolution a from the memo
chairman bernanke              yes vice chairman dudley        yes governor duke                     yes

you very much
meeting recessed
march 18 2009morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  i guess were ready now
finally for the economic review  let me turn it over to dave stockton
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  in looking at the myriad ways in which we were surprised by the incoming data and forced by evolving economic and financial circumstances to revise our forecast i began to think that maybe my wife was on to something when she recently gave me a tshirt that reads mind of an athlete  body of a genius  laughter  well as you know from reading the greenbook we did mark down substantially our forecast this round  we are now projecting that real gdp will fall 2 percent this year and increase just 1 percent next year those are downward revisions of about 1 and 1 percentage point respectively from our january projection  given that weaker outlook for activity we expect that the unemployment rate will rise to 9 percent in early 2010 where it will remain through the end of the year
three principal factors were behind the sizable downward revision that we made to our forecast  first much weaker foreign activity and a stronger exchange value of the dollar second weaker incoming data on employment production and spending for the domestic economy and third at least as of last wednesday a drop in the stock market of about 15 percent relative to our january forecast
steve will have more to say about the foreign outlook but in sum the projected deterioration in foreign activity and the higher value of the dollar account for about onethird of the downward revision that we have made to our forecast of gdp  but the incoming data on the domestic economy have been dismal as well  starting with the labor market private payrolls have been dropping at an average monthly pace of 650000 since november surprising us to the downside  indeed the level of payroll employment in february was 550000 lower than was anticipated in our january forecast  and since the february reference week initial claims have moved up further as has the level of insured unemployment suggesting that job losses likely remained appreciable this month  the household survey has shown a similar deterioration  the unemployment rate rose to 81 percent in february nearly
 percentage point above the level that we expected in our previous forecast
measures of manufacturing production also point to a steep contraction in activity  after falling at a 17 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter further widespread declines in factory output in january and february put us on track for an even steeper drop in the current quarter  moreover national and regional purchasing managers indexes suggest that declines will continue in the coming months
plummeting output left the capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing sector at about 67 percent in february its lowest level since we began publishing that series in 1948
as you know the motor vehicle sector has been especially hardhit  in response to the steady weakening of demand over the past year automakers have slashed production  assemblies of light vehicles fell to a 37 million unit pace in january the lowest level since the 1950s and that includes months in which there have been uaw strikes  production increased to a still meager 4 million unit pace in february and we expect a further increase to about 5 million units in march  but for the current quarter as a whole the average level of production is low enough to lop 2 percentage points off the change in real gdp
we have motor vehicle sales bottoming out in the next couple of months at levels just a bit below those seen in february  if that occurs some further modest increase in production seems likely as inventories will have been brought into substantially better alignment with sales  that said production in the second quarter is only expected to move up to what we previously would have considered a deep recession level of 5 million units
in addition to significant downside surprises in the labor market and in industrial production the incoming spending data have been much weaker than we had expected seven weeks ago  starting with some ancient history we lowered our estimate of fourthquarter real gdp by 2 percentage points to show a decline of
6 percent at an annual rate with much weaker final sales more than accounting for the downward revision  moreover the incoming data early this year have led us to revise down our estimate of output for the first quarter as well  indeed the ink had barely dried on the greenbook when we received weakerthanexpected trade data last friday  taking on board those data we would probably mark down a bit further our projected decline in real gdp closer to minus 7 percent about 1 percentage points below our january forecast
aside from net exports some of the biggest negative surprises have been in capital spending which is contracting more sharply than we had expected  business fixed investment fell at an annual rate of 22 percent in the fourth quarter and is projected to drop at a 25 percent pace this quarter  large cutbacks are being made in outlays for both equipment and structures  the pullback in capital spending has been greater than can be explained by business sales and interest rates alone suggesting that financing constraints and heightened economic uncertainty are part of the story
spending by state and local governments has fallen noticeably as well we had been expecting these governments to hold outlays roughly steady while waiting for greater clarity on potential relief from the federal government  instead mounting budget pressures led these entities to cut employment and spending late last year and early this year  we still think fiscal stimulus will provide a boost to state and local spending but from a lower underlying base than we had expected in january
the one notable positive innovation has come from retail sales which posted increases in both january and february  given the stronger recent numbers and the imminent support from fiscal stimulus we now expect some stabilization in consumer
spending in the near term rather than the declines we had projected in the last forecast  still with mounting job losses deteriorating household balance sheets and sour sentiment we dont think a sustained upturn in consumer spending will occur until late this year
all told the large downward revisions we have made to employment production and sales in the near term have important implications for the dynamics of the forecast going forward  the weaker labor market implies lower incomes and lower consumer outlays  and with the stock market down from our previous projection those multiplier consequences for spending are amplified by more negative wealth effects  the accompanying weaker spending and business sales in turn feed back into lower capital outlays through the accelerator effect
another key element in the downward revision that we made to our forecast was housing  it has seemed no matter how low we set the forecast the data surprise us to the downside  sales starts and permits all fell more than we expected in january and we revised down the projected trajectory of housing starts significantly over the forecast period  as for the timing of when we expect to reach the bottom in starts with a dogged persistence that is beginning to resemble that of chicago cubs fans our motto remains wait until next quarter  yesterdays data on housing starts for february provide a glimmer of hope  both starts and permits moved up rather than declining as we had expected  but just as a few wins in spring training dont portend a world series it would be premature to read the starts figures for february as suggesting that we have reached a bottom in this sector
the deeper declines that have occurred in final sales have left firms facing a larger inventory problem than we had earlier thought  in addition to the overhangs of unsold houses and motor vehicles that have been with us for some time inventory sales ratios now appear elevated in a wide range of industries  as a consequence the production adjustment in our current forecast is larger and more protracted than the one incorporated in the january greenbook
while our projected recession is deeper and longer than in our previous forecast we do see a variety of forces capable of braking the decline in activity and promoting an eventual recovery  for one the most negative multiplieraccelerator effects associated with last years shock are expected to fade out over the course of this year moreover fiscal stimulus should provide a sizable boost to demand and production in coming months
and we expect financial conditions to gradually improve over the balance of this year and in 2010 with the stock market turning up bond spreads narrowing and credit restrictions easing  this broad improvement in financial conditions is an important element in our projected recovery  on this point we take some limited comfort from the lack of further deterioration in recent months in some of our summary measures of financial stressindicators that we have used to help gauge the unusual restraint on spending created by the disruptions in financial markets  all
told an anemic recovery gets under way in 2010 and then gathers further momentum in 2011 and beyond
one notable feature of our forecast is that we have a downturn that in magnitude equals or exceeds those of 1970s and 1980s but is followed by a recovery that looks like the gradual ones of the early 1990s and early 2000s  we think this makes sense for several reasons
first the deterioration in household wealth has been enormous and even with our projected increase in the stock market the wealthtoincome ratio remains much lower than it has been for the past 20 years  the adjustment of household spending to that reduction in wealth seems likely to occur slowly holding down spending for some time  second and perhaps more speculatively we dont think sizable pentup demand is developing in either the household or business sector  admittedly it is awfully difficult to estimate target capital stocks for either sector but our rough estimates suggest that we should not expect a big boost from efforts to rebuild depressed capital stocks  third conventional monetary policy actions have been exhausted and we did not assume any additional nonconventional actions in this forecast  nor have we assumed any additional fiscal stimulus  and finally as we noted in the january chart show we read the evidence as suggesting that recoveries from financial crises tend to be more sluggish than those from other recessions
turning to inflation the cpi for february was released this morning4   the headline cpi increased 04 percent in line with our expectations  although food prices edged down 01 percent higher gasoline prices boosted the energy component by 33 percent  core cpi increased 02 percent which was 01 percentage point above our forecast  our miss was at least in part attributable to a jump in motor vehicle pricesan event which i am prepared to claim with uncharacteristic confidence either didnt happen or will be reversed in the next few months
beyond the near term we have marked down further our inflation projection in response to the weaker outlook for economic activity a stronger dollar and lower oil prices  after increasing 2 percent in 2008 total pce prices are now projected to increase  percent over the four quarters of this year and to increase  percent next year with the projection for both years about  percentage point below our january forecast  we expect a smoother deceleration in core pce prices from 2 percent last year to 1 percent this year and  percent in 2010
there are sizable risks to both sides of our inflation projection  on the one hand many of our models are projecting a more pronounced deceleration of prices and a move into outright deflation by next year  those models appear to be expecting an appreciable decline in inflation expectations in response to wide margins of slack in resource utilization and low rates of headline inflation  on the other hand it is very difficult to discern any noticeable shift down in longerterm inflation expectations since last summer even as headline inflation has come down in the wake of the

4  a table distributed by mr stockton is appended to this document appendix 4
collapse of energy prices and the unemployment rate has jumped up  we have taken the middle ground here and assumed that expectations will drift lower but by less than some of our models are projecting  steve will complete our presentation
mr kamin  following on daves litany of woes about the us economy i can offer little comfort from the international arena except to say that were not alone in our troubles  data weve received since your last meeting indicate that foreign gdp declined at a 7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter much faster than we estimated in january and the sharpest quarterly declineby farsince the start of our series in 1970  of course while the phrase misery loves company rings true from a psychological standpoint it doesnt work so well in economics  as ill discuss later on in my remarks us exports plunged in the fourth quarter and were a significant drag on us growth
the fact that the rest of the world has joined the united states in recession is not all that surprising  with the united states accounting for about a quarter of global gdp and with the worlds major economies tightly linked through trade and finance downturns in the us economy historically have coincided with downturns in foreign growth  the big surprise has been which countries have been hit the hardest  the united states the united kingdom and the euro area which have been at the epicenter of the financial crisis registered fourthquarter declines in gdp of merely 6 to 7 percent  conversely in many economies whose banking and housing sectors were less affected by the initial turmoil output dropped much more sharply  by
10 percent in mexico 12 percent in japan 13 percent in brazil and more than 20 percent in korea taiwan and thailand
what accounts for the seemingly outsized response of many economies to the financial crisis  clearly one factor at work here is that as is typically the case in recessions the demand for manufactures has fallen more sharply than demand for total goods and servicesthis has led to unusually sharp falloffs in exports by many asian economies  a second factor has been the collapse in commodity prices which has weighed heavily on economies in latin america and the middle east  finally since the intensification of the global crisis last fall investors have been pulling out of many emerging market economies disrupting the flow of credit to households and firms
indicators for the current quarter are pointing to another 7 percent drop in foreign gdp with activity declining at a similar pace in both the advanced and emerging market economies  industrial production purchasing managers surveys and business and consumer sentiment have either continued to fall in the past few months or are holding at the extraordinarily depressed levels reached late last year  our forecast has foreign output declining more gradually in the second quarter before bottoming out later this year and accelerating to nearly 3 percent by the end of 2010
if our forecast materializes the foreign economy will have endured four quarters of contraction the same as in the 19811982 recession but much longer than the
slowdowns of 1974 and 2001  by the time the foreign economy touches bottom late this year real gdp will have declined a record 4 percent and we are projecting a weaker rebound thereafter than occurred following the prior downturns  accordingly although it seems premature to be predicting the recovery when economies are still in free fall our outlook does not seem entirely fanciful  it does however depend importantly on a number of factors that remain up in the air including a stabilization of financial conditions and the recovery of the us economy
given the difficult outlook strong support from the public sector will be critical foreign governments will be providing a substantial amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus over the next few quarters  however given the pace at which private demand is contracting and our uncertainties over its prospects we judge this stimulus to be just adequate to secure the tepid recovery we are projecting but insufficient to insure against any future negative shocks
starting with monetary policy japan canada and the united kingdom already have cut policy rates to 50 basis points or below  and although the ecbs target remains at a lofty 1 percent the market rate itself has been trading in the neighborhood of 85 basis points  accordingly any significant further monetary support will have to come from balancesheet expansions  the bank of england bank of japan and swiss national bank have moved forward on such measures in recent weeks and we expect them to be followed by other major foreign central banks but to what extent and with what ultimate effect on their economies remain open questions
in the emerging market economies notwithstanding the pace at which output is contracting we expect only moderate further policy loosening  central banks in asia have already eased considerably and a number of policy rates in the region are now at 2 percent or below  in latin america interest rates remain much further above the zero lower bound but the falloff in capital inflows associated sharp currency depreciations and continued high inflation will likely restrain further rate cuts
given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy the need for fiscal support is all the more pressing  by our estimates recently announced fiscal plans should add about 1 percentage point to foreign growth both in the advanced and emerging market economies in 2009  this represents considerable stimulus roughly similar to that projected for the united states this year  but as only the us and chinese plans provide significant additional stimulus in 2010 more effort will be required should the global recession prove more persistent than expected  moreover many countries with high public debt or deficitssuch as greece ireland hungary and turkey to name just a feware constrained from substantial fiscal support and may even have to cut their budgets
if financial conditions ease enough to allow freer access to international capital markets a number of governments may loosen monetary and fiscal policies further however rather than stabilizing there is a distinct risk that financial conditions could
take a turn for the worse  we are particularly concerned that the fragile situation in eastern europe could deteriorate into a fullfledged banking and balanceofpayments crisis jeopardizing the condition of many western european banks and potentially triggering a global emerging markets meltdown  such a crisis would not only deepen contractionary pressures in the world economy but would prompt many governments to tighten their monetary and fiscal stance just when accommodative policies were most needed
even without an emerging markets meltdown the global recession is having a profound effect on international trade and on the us economy  in the fourth quarter
us real exports plunged at an annual rate of 25 percent  this by itself would have subtracted more than 3 percentage points from us gdp growth  because us imports plunged as well net exports subtracted a little under a half percentage point from gdp growth but this is still a far cry from the nearly 2 percentage point positive contribution registered in the first half of 2008  going forward we expect both imports and exports to drop off further this quarter and next as the recession here and abroad continues with the contribution of net exports hovering around zero  in the remainder of the forecast period however imports start picking up along with the
us economy while exports remain moribund  although we see the economies of our trading partners recovering a bit faster than the us economy another outcome of the global financial crisisthe nearly 20 percent rise in the dollar since last summerhelps support imports and restrain exports  as a result we predict net exports will subtract a half percentage point from us gdp growth during the remainder of the forecast period adding yet another headwind to a long and growing list
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions for our colleagues  president
lacker
mr lacker  mr stockton what did you say about auto prices  i didnt quite catch
what made you believe they were going to reverse
mr stockton  new vehicles prices were up nearly a percentage point 08 percent
for february  i guess it was just more a hunch given the incredible weakness in demand
currently and the fact that there still is a very high days supply  it seems unlikely to me that we
are on the verge of a turnaround in motor vehicle prices  so we had actually been expecting a
decline  we got an increase  i am skeptical
mr lacker  thanks
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  yes  dave the administration has asserted that the fiscal policy package
will preserve andor increase jobs by 3 to 4 million in the next couple of years  i was trying to
figure out from your fiscal policy analysis what the comparable number was  i couldnt quite get
there although my rough calculation was maybe 2 or 2 million
mr stockton  it centers on about 2 million somewhere between 1 to 2 million
jobs implicit in our package over the course of the next two years
mr stern  okay  thanks
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  on the international side you talked
about and our focus seems to be on eastern europe and the european banks  but im hearing a
lot of concern about mexico both political meltdownreally serious civil disorder problems
and obviously some economic implications  do you have any comments on the mexican
economy
mr kamin  from an overall economic standpoint the situation in mexico is quite
serious  first of all for the past three or four years mexican growth has probably been less than
we might have expected given its proximity to the united states and our markets and given how
much potential there was for the economy to grow if the right structural reforms were
implemented  in fact a lot of those reforms have not been implemented  mexican growth has
been sort of moribund  it has depended on the united states as a source of both external demand
and jobs for its people  now that the us economy is going down the mexican economy is
suffering pretty badly as evidenced by the 10 percent annual rate of decline in gdp in the fourth
quarter
let me just add that obviously it is facing very serious political problems as well  there
have been a lot of reports in the paper about drug problems and the violence associated with that
so clearly on a wide range of issues mexico has got problems
balance of payments and banking sector issues were of course front and center in
mexicos crisis of 94 and 95 and we would be hesitant to discount that possibility entirely
now but interestingly the banking system in mexico seems to pose less risk than it might
certainly less than the banking system in eastern europe and probably less than those in other
emerging market economies  first of all a large share of its banks are foreignowned and that
represents some source of stability  on top of that the banks that are operating there appear to
be less dependent on shortterm wholesale sources of financing  so their situation is a little
better  obviously the situation could take a turn for the worse in the coming year if the decline
in output is sufficiently large that nonperforming loans go up a lot  but for right now as i say
while mexico has got a lot of problems on the balance of payments and on the banking fronts
the issues dont seem as pronounced
chairman bernanke  others  no other questions  no response  okay  then
were ready to begin our economic goround  im going to start with president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the eighth district economy is in
recession  its possibly somewhat less severe than in some parts of the country but still a very
sharp recession  all of the problems that we see nationally are certainly apparent in the eighth
district including credit market problems deeply depressed auto sales declining house prices
and so on  the national economy appears to have weakened further relative to january
expectations  i think theres further downside risk and i agree with many here that the main risk
is some kind of failure to get the financial sector on track toward recovery  the global aspect of
the downturn continues unabated  i think this is a very worrisome factor  its largely outside our
historical experience in the modern era  it may be that were not fully comprehending the
meaning of global events because they havent really been part of our experience  and im
worried about that
i think expectations remain very fluid both for the course of the real economy and for
inflation  we know that expectations have a huge influence on macroeconomic outcomes  that
influence is partially masked in normal times  in normal times expectations are very stable in
normal times for output the private sector would expect something close to the balanced growth
path in normal times for inflation the private sector would expect something close to the
implicit inflation target pursued by the central bank  so in normal times it appears that
expectations dont move that much and perhaps therefore are not so important to how the
economy is going to function
but these are not normal times  as a result expectations are very fluid and can be
significantly influenced by just a few events  its as if the private sector is throwing out all of the
old data because the old data come from a different regime that doesnt apply anymore and
theyre looking at the most recent developments just a few things that are happening and
deciding which direction the economy is likely to go and which direction inflation is likely to go
this is what makes me especially worried about the economy and the inflation path during 2009
in particular i think further disinflation and possible deflation is a clear nearterm risk
deflationary expectations could become entrenched during 2009 especially given the downside
risks to the forecast including the global nature of the very sharp downturn and the possibility
that the financial sector problems wont be addressed in an appropriate way or quickly enough
deflation would exacerbate problems in the housing sector and credit markets generally because
of the prevalence of nominal contracting in the economy  so i think a nearterm goal for
monetary policy is to avoid this outcome  in the medium term we actually face inflation risk
because the expansion of the balance sheet would suggest lots of inflation possibilities out there
i call this a twoheaded dragon  but if we get stuck in a deflationary trap youre never going to
see that materialize  and again a deflationary trap is to my thinking a steady state  you get
stuck there and you cannot get out
is a deflationary trap a real possibility  we have the clear example of japan  we have
foreign central banks sending their policy rates to zero globally  our own model and our own
baseline forecast have core pce inflation at 1 percent in 2009 and below 1 percent for 2010
2011 2012 and 2013  with an economy in that kind of state for that long suppose you get
another negative shock at some point then you do go down to the deflation trap equilibrium and
get stuck there  so i really think its a problem for the near termthat we could get stuck in that
trap
policy should attempt to avoid letting deflationary expectations take hold  how should
we do this  i really liked the bank of englands announcement during the intermeeting period
they said that they were planning to expand the balance sheet to increase the monetary base
they said that they expected that to feed through to the broader money stock measures and that
the growth in the money stock would help them to maintain their mediumterm inflation target  i
thought that was a crystalclear piece of communication and the markets understand exactly
what it means and what the intent of policy is  so i thought that that was a good example to
follow  those are my comments on the economy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  i was first going to say to dave stockton that our wives have an affinity
for tshirts  my wife a smart wellesley woman who spent most of her time at mit arrived at
oxford noting that the ratio of women to men was 1 to 11  she had a tshirt for other women
which she sold briskly and it said come to oxford where the odds are good but the goods are
odd  laughter
mr chairman i want to report on the microeconomic input i received from my corporate
contacts which numbered some 29 ceos around the country whom i talked to before this
meeting  unfortunately it confirms what dave and steve presented  in fact one actually called
me and said do you want some good news  and i said please  he said call somebody
else  laughter
as to our district we have fallen finally into recession  we created jobs last year  i
believe we are the only district that did create jobs last year or had jobs created in the district
the cut is less severeit will take fewer stitches to mendbut nonetheless we have been cut
as to the national economy my favorite indicators are all negative  there are 175000
railcars that are out of commission  there has been some improvement in bulk shipping rates
but that is a head fake according to shippers i have talked to because of the extraordinary
purchase of iron ore that china undertook recentlyin fact record amounts  if you look at
containers and other shipping indicators these are all flat to negative  of the worlds large
aircraft fleet 20 percentthats 2800 airplanesare now sitting unused in the desert  if you
look at boeings numbers it received only four orders for new aircraft versus several hundred
last february  and im told by my contacts in the airline industry that the chinese government
has ordered all of their carriers not to take the liberty of buying a single plane in 2009  that
from one of the largest net new buyers of aircraft in the world
there is very little capex taking place  in fact every corporate contact i spoke to from
the large manufacturers to even disney is cutting back on capex and displaying all kinds of
microeconomic behavioral patterns that indicate the kind of deflationary trap that my colleague
just spoke about  weve talked about them before but the essence is they are withholding
decisions  theyre withholding decisions because they hope to get it done cheaper later
theyre also withholding decisions because they are confused  and you see this in some of the
data from those that touch many consumers in the country as well  for example according to
att its large enterprise business has just stopped its small business demand is in decline its
800 services are down  and very interestingly overall minutes are declining significantly  one
of the indications of movement of people is roaming minutes  roaming minutes domestically
and internationally according to the ceo of att have come to a screeching halt
the picture is similar if you talk to people in the travel and entertainment business which
i do like to look at  if you aggregate it properly not just airline travel not just hotels but sports
and entertainment and all that derives from it its a significantly sized industry  according to
disneys ceo travel and entertainment is down 46 percent yearoveryear in february  thats
confirmed by the number of credit card transactions which are up but the total amount is down
according to the ceo of jcpenney whom im fortunate to have on my board this is going to
manifest itself in further contraction with particular risk in the commercial real estate area  the
chairman of the retail federation estimates that of 1100 major malls in the united states a third
will fail over the course of the next three years  this is not happy news  part of it has to do with
the lack of debtorinpossession financing  without dip financing you accelerate the process
and i dont know how we are ever going to deal with that situation
i couldnt find any silver linings  there is i suppose a pewter lining as i like to call it
and governor tarullo without any insult to your industry one of the virtues is that the legal
industry is also contracting laughter 6000 people were laid off from major law firms year to
date  theres a website that actually tracks this  whats interesting about it is that the
transaction business has dried up and is not being compensated for by the bankruptcy business  i
think the reason the bankruptcy business is not proceeding is because debtorinpossession
financing is very hard to come by and remains a problem
theres also another pewter lining in the walmart reports  gas price declines have
added 120 to 130 per customer per month  the ceo however noted some inflation in
apparel prices thus far this year but they believe that is also a head fake because they can tell
from their own inventory that eventually those prices will have to come down
so overall mr chairman the situation is bleak  the key underlying weak factor that i
hear about from ceo after ceo from microeconomic operator after microeconomic operator
big or small is a lack of confidence  when i first walked onto the training floors of brown
brothers 37 years ago robert roosa gave me a quote that i havent forgotten which came from
james madison  the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money  there
is no confidence
i want to come back to a statement i made yesterday and ill withhold my comments on
policy until the next round  in order to instill confidence first it takes time and second you
have to exhibit competence  and in order to exhibit competence i think you have to keep things
simple  i came away from yesterdays session deeply concerned about our conversation about
the talf and the complexity with which were engaging in policy  and i hope we can figure
out a way to do what we do in the simplest most communicative manner possible  im worried
that we are turning to the shadow banking system to solve problems that they put us into in the
first place  ill just conclude with an analogy as a teaser for what i expect to say in the next
round and thats the following  we have to be very very careful that we dont give a steam
shovel and a case of red bull to the people who dug us into the hole we are in and who have
undermined confidence and have put us in a predicament thats extremely difficult to get out of
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  let me start by congratulating you on
having a highway interchange named after you  im sure we all envy you having your own
offramp  laughter
conditions in the sixth district remain very weak and our contacts expect worsening
conditions in the near term  businesses have made significant workforce reductions and tell us
they are prepared to make additional cuts if economic conditions worsen  the end of the first
quarter was seen by some as being a key milestone  if business conditions have not improved by
then they will move further to put their businesses in survival mode so more layoffs could be
forthcoming in april  all sectors of commercial real estate are under pressure from growing
vacancy rates and upward adjustment of cap rates  im concerned that growing problems in
commercial real estate are likely to further complicate efforts to stabilize the banking system and
credit markets
theres anecdotal evidence of alarm being expressed about and by the local government
sector  some jurisdictions and authorities are pinched not only by falling revenues but also by
borrowing conditions in the municipal finance market  one large city mayor estimated several
thousand private sector job losses from projects not helped by the stimulus package that will shut
down in the near term due to financing difficulties
our directors and their contacts as well as financial market contacts are becoming
increasingly vocal over the lack of specificity regarding economic policy and their inability to
understand what we would call our decision rules  a major source of confusion is uncertainty
about what policy actions will come next and under what circumstances expansions of current
policy will be decided
turning to the national economic conditions in the outlook the numbers indicate we
remain in serious recession with most data coming in worse than atlantas already downbeat
expectations  if we were to submit a formal forecast for this meeting we would adjust our
trajectory for the economy downward and push the timing of the beginning of a recovery further
out
as mentioned earlier by dave stockton one positive in the recent data is retail sales
numbers  however the cfo of the countrys second largest retailer advised a cautious
interpretation of sales numbers  consumer purchases are occurring in an environment of deep
price discounts and may not be a very solid indicator of improving economic health  also
retailers are consolidating their inventories as they prepare for store closures
we believe the risks remain to the downside for both economic growth and inflation  in
my conversations this time with a few financial market participants and bankers there was
acknowledgement of improved conditions in a number of markets particularly where the fed
continues to intervene  also progress of investmentgrade corporate funding markets was noted
at the same time there was sentiment that the feds credit programs may have to stay in place
for quite some time well into 2010
on the subject of the housing and home mortgage market i heard the view that the magic
rate threshold for qualifying mortgage applications volume is 5 percent  when rates drop below
5 percent refinancing volume especially has picked up markedly
to repeat what i said yesterday most of the sharpest comments dealt with the perceived
policy ambiguity and the effect of this on markets  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  we are more than a year into this
recession and yet the decline in gdp and deterioration in labor markets continue unabated and
indeed continue to surprise on the downside  while im hopeful that our actions and the fiscal
stimulus package will help to stabilize the economy in the second half of the year the downside
risks to our forecast remain my primary concern  like the greenbook the boston fed forecast
expects that the unemployment rate will remain well above full employment and inflation will
remain well below my target throughout the forecast horizon  indeed the boston fed forecast
implies a high probability of a deflationary period if aggressive action is not taken
concerns with credit availability continue to be a dominant theme when i talk to
businesses of all sizes  lenders are looking for opportunities to tighten terms of lending
agreements and rollover of financing agreements remains problematic  in anticipation of
continuing financing difficulties firms report that they are restricting operations  even
organizations that normally would build through a downturn such as hospitals and major
universities have halted projects leaving holes and halffinished buildings at many construction
sites in boston
i see several worrisome nearterm concerns that are likely to impede morenormal
financial market functioning  first once we have reworked the initial submissions of the stress
tests the results for several major banks are unlikely to be consistent with public
pronouncements by some major banks that additional capital is not necessary  as our baseline
forecast is quickly converging to the stress scenario used in the exercise there is a real risk of
loss of public credibility as it becomes apparent that some large banks will need substantially
more capital which in the current environment can only be supplied by the government  i am
concerned that stock prices and credit markets may suffer additional setbacks and make some of
our forecasts for the stock market going forward a little more problematic
second the delays in removing problem assets will continue to cast a shadow on many
asset prices  we may need to move to simpler more straightforward solutions for removal of
problem assets possibly in conjunction with the additional equity infusions at the end of the
stress tests
third like president lockhart im very worried about the commercial real estate sector
which is rapidly deteriorating  neither the cmbs market nor banks are likely to provide much
support for the rollover of commercial real estate financing  and im increasingly concerned
about life insurance companies which have traditionally been significant investors in
commercial real estate as share prices of the major publicly held life insurers are now for the
most part selling at less than onefifth of what they were six months ago likely resulting in a
limited financial capacity to provide commercial real estate financing  in addition the decline in
commercial real estate prices is putting many commercial properties under water adding to
financing constraints  while we normally do not consider life insurers to be a source of systemic
concerns that would have significant impacts on markets that assumption may be tested over the
course of this year
finally stabilizing the housing sector is critically important  while a small component of
gdp the impact of housing problems has been disproportionate to its weight in gdp  declines
in housing prices continue to limit borrowing capacity for households cause large losses in
household wealth that slow future consumption and contribute to the significant losses
embedded in mortgage instruments and related derivative products for a variety of financial
intermediaries  while recently announced federal programs should help those programs may
not fully reflect the new reality that job losses are likely to be the primary reason that borrowers
cannot make payments  we held a mortgage foreclosure event in hartford connecticut last
month attended by roughly 900 borrowers  discussions with the borrowers at the event and
subsequent survey results indicate that job losses among one or more family members were
already a key driver in pushing borrowers to foreclosure  taking aggressive action to stabilize
housing and employment may be particularly important at this juncture  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i would say that the tenth district is going to reflect very
much what you have heard in the national briefing  it was doing better than the nation as a
whole but is now quickly deteriorating into the national average  our labor markets have
continued to deteriorate  unemployment rates are going up in each of our states  our
manufacturing activity has actually plummeted importantly because of the weakening of the
export market that was mentioned earlier  our agricultural sector is still holding its own but it
too is showing signs of weakening as is our energy industry  commercial real estate is showing
signs of weakening because of some of the refinancing thats now required and because of the
increasing vacancies that are affecting the cash flows off these and therefore affecting some of
the parties holding these notes
i would point out too that financing in the region has deteriorated id say badly
almost and ill give you one anecdote  i understand that its not hard data but it gives you a
sense of the situation  we have an insurance company that does premium financing about
1 billion financed out of a major new york bank  it went back to refinance a portion of the
loan and the bank wanted libor plus 500  the ceo of this company said you know i
understand i have to help recapitalize that industry but this is taking all my profit  so it is
trying to get other types of financing  and that kind of pressure is of course trickling down and
affects how they do business as well  so it is a pretty daunting task for businesses in this type of
environment i realize
finally when we look across the district were seeing increasing numbers of problem
banks as well as banks that we would put on a watch list because of the concentrations in say
real estate or some sectors of agriculture  so overall the district is reflecting the deteriorating
conditions in the nation as a whole and that is of course a concern to us as well as to everyone
else here
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  the third district economy remains very
weak and there are few signs that this weakness will lessen any time soon  the threestate
region hit its employment peak in january 2008  since then it has lost 18 percent of its jobs
and 60 percent of that loss has come just in the last three months  you might step back and say
well maybe this is the darkness before the dawn  i wish i had confidence in that but im not
sure thats whats going on  it looks pretty bleak
our business outlook survey is set to be released at 1000 tomorrow morning so its
confidential until then  last months reading was near a record of minus 41  the reading that
will be reported tomorrow morning is minus 35 so its some improvement  we usually take
about five points as being statistically significant so this is just at that margin  a few months
ago the index went up and just fell back down again  so i dont know that theres a whole lot of
comfort in the most recent number i take it to mean things are about the same as they were
survey participants do expect the outlook to improve in the next six months  but many of the
forwardlooking indicators suggest that before that comes about there will be further cutbacks in
employment and further retrenchment in capital investment at our regional manufacturers
although banks in the third district are in somewhat better shape than the national
averagethey tend to be doing pretty wellthey do report consumer loan volume is down  and
many of them also report that companies dont want to invest and dont want to borrow money at
this point  so its demand retrenchment rather than just supply retrenchment from their
perspective
bankers in general in our district are angrytheyre mad theyre furious at the
government  im getting requests to give tarp money back at an increasing pace  theyre not
being allowed to do it or nobody at the treasury is helping them do that  they are as president
lockhart said frustrated with the lack of clarity about where policy is going and what its going
to be  theyre angry about the changes in the rules of the game the ground shifting beneath
their feet  and theyre frustrated that some of the programs arent doing what theyre supposed
to be doing  i have one major player in the student loan industry saying that the talf is not
going to do anything for student loans which by and large are 7 to 10year loans in view of the
time it takes to get through college  so buying new issues of threeyear loans wont help them
because they dont offer many student loans for three years  i can go down the list of many other
industries who feel the same way  whom are we going to bail out whom are we going to
protect and whom are we going to support going forward  i think theres a lot of angst a lot of
uncertainty and a lot of frustration out there in the business community and the financial
community in particular
so our district economys outlook looks largely in line with that of the national
economy  as president bullard suggested one of the things that has been most worrying in the
recent episode is the dramatic decline in foreign countries and the impact thats having  thats
something we cant do much about directly but it is worrying and again its causing more
angst and more fear and more problems
now amidst this downpour of bad news and numbers there is a possible ray of sunshine
i noteas dave stockton didthat the consumption numbers seem to suggest that the free fall
in consumption may have come to an end  i hope thats the case that would be encouraging
both retail sales and disposable income numbers have held up in the last couple of months and
personal consumption expenditures have as well
the last two months of consumer price inflation data suggest to me that the risk of a
sustained deflation at least in the near term is somewhat abated  so im not as concerned as
some arepresident bullard for exampleabout the shift to sustained deflationary
expectations  although i think we have to worry about it thats not my number one concern at
this point
overall my outlook for the national economy is pessimistic for the near term although i
continue to have a lot of belief that markets eventually will recover so i may be a little more
optimistic on a recovery than the greenbook
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  the economic and financial news has been
grim  things are now so bad that i actually open the greenbook with greater trepidation than my
401k  laughter  the awful employment and spending data have not been much of a surprise
but they do dispel remaining hopes that we might see a turnaround any time soon  this
conclusion is reinforced by what im hearing from my business contacts  their already sour
mood is taking another sharp turn for the worse  one director reported that businesses were so
shaken that it would take a sustained period of positive data on the order of six to nine months
before they would begin to consider expanding production and employment  another disturbing
sign of how tough things are getting is that people appear to be breaking into their piggybanks to
make ends meetthe cash product office reports huge increases in the amount of coins being
brought into our inventory  laughter  the december inventories of quarters and dollar coins
were up more than 50 percent from 2007 and even pennies were up nearly 25 percent
looking ahead some moreoptimistic forecasters have argued that were likely to see a
rapid vshaped recovery similar to the ones that followed several past severe postwar recessions
the case for such an outcome is that housing construction and purchases of durable goods
especially cars have been running way below trend for some time  over time these capital
stocks will fall well below desired levels and eventually investment must rise to bring stocks
back in line with fundamentals  the resulting pentup demand may lead to a surge in spending
once the financial system regains its health and uncertainty is diminished
but my fear is that we may not even get a modest ushaped recovery much less a v
shaped one  i have three reasons for this pessimism  first the global nature of the recession
means we cant rely on foreign demand to provide support for our economy  instead a sharp
downturn abroad and recent dollar appreciation have driven down our exports and exacerbated
our downturn  indeed given the high degree of synchronization among all of the major
economies of the world this is the first truly global recession since the depression  furthermore
as the downturn has spread to more countries new cracks have developed in the already strained
banking system  steve discussed the situation in eastern europe and we share his concerns
these countries have an estimated 1 trillion of debt to western european banks and its
fortunate that us banks have little exposure in this region  but loans from austrian banks to
eastern europe exceed 80 percent of austrias gdp and the exposure of banks in sweden and
belgium exceeds 30 percent of gdp  severe losses on these loans do pose significant threats to
the banking systems in these countries
my second concern is that despite our best efforts at using both traditional and
nontraditional monetary tools the stance of credit market conditions has only improved
modestly  in past recessions the fed has been able to fuel a turnaround rapidly by stepping on
the accelerator through sharp rate cuts  but in the current crisis it feels more like we are
desperately trying to power a bicycle uphill rather than pressing an accelerator on a high
powered sports car  this conclusion is supported by work by my staff that aims to gauge the
stance of credit market conditions  in particular we use principal components analysis on a set
of private sector interest rates to construct a metric of credit conditions that in normal times
moves very closely with the real federal funds rate  according to this metric we were basically
treading water during much of the last year with our policy actions roughly neutralizing the
effects of the credit crisis on private rates  since september and the introduction of more
aggressive policy actions by the fed the fdic and the treasury this metric of credit market
conditions has improved somewhat and is now at a level consistent with a modest degree of
accommodation but nowhere near as much accommodation as implied by the level of the real
fed funds rate or called for by the stance of the economy  and of course this analysis abstracts
from nonprice terms of credit and those continue to tighten as well  we see that in the senior
loan officer opinion survey  and one community banker on my board mentioned that he finds
it now difficult to summon the emotional energy to make loans to anybody at all
a third reason to doubt that we will enjoy a vshaped recovery is the huge damage that
has been done to balance sheets  household wealth has plummeted  it fell more than 5 trillion
in the fourth quarter alone  unfortunately households were not well positioned for such a shot
to wealth  instead many had leveraged up to the hilt and the combination of the dramatic loss
in wealth and the massive household debt overhang portends years of subdued spending as
households go through an extended period of deleveraging  i see worrisome parallels to the
japanese corporate sector during the 1990s  in that case the attempt of firms to pay down debt
produced a decade of weak investment  the downward pressure on household leverage will
come both from lenders and from households  lenders are likely to demand more collateral for
loans going forward and that collateral has been devastated by the collapse of housing and other
wealth and households are likely to recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for
precautionary reasons and meeting longerterm goals such as downpayment requirements and
retirement  as one of my directors quipped people may come to realize that they dont need
three carsthey can get by with two and maybe even just one
the outlook for inflation is worrisome as well  i think its fair to say it is no longer a risk
that inflation will persist for a time below the preferred rateinstead its our expectation
whats more the probability of outright deflation is significant  in that regard im closely
monitoring wage developments as i view the outbreak of sizable wage cuts to be a crucial step
leading to sustained deflation  i have heard scattered reports of such cuts but so far the majority
of my directors say theyre reluctant to cut wages for fear that it would undermine employee
morale  nonetheless many of them cautioned that if the economy continues to deteriorate they
will have no choice but to cut wages and salaries  so to summarize i dont see forces at work
that will propel our economy into sustained robust recovery any time soon  even though the
greenbook forecast is hardly upbeat i see substantial downside risk to that forecast both for
economic activity and inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the reports from my contacts have been
very weak for months now  in order to get a better sense of the outlook i asked some of my
contacts some questions focused on whether their responses thus far to the recession have been
enough to prepare them for the weakness that they are anticipating in their markets
unfortunately the vast majority of them said that they had not done enough and that they
continue to curtail their activities and investments at a very quick pace  and their confidence in
a recovery later on this year is dwindling
i am concerned that this lack of confidence is translating into actions that will further
dampen our prospects in coming months  i was surprised that even some of the more successful
manufacturers in my district such as eaton lincoln electric and parkerhannifin are all
implementing further cutbacks in investments hiring and production plans  in several cases
these further cutbacks have been motivated by this deepening retrenchment that we are seeing
with our foreign partners  but some of my contacts are losing confidence in the policy responses
to the recession  several of my directors noted last week at our meeting that public confidence is
obviously critical to our recovery plans yet the public is increasingly finding the governments
response confusing and incomplete  this lack of confidence is weighing on their expectations
for growth this year and even next year  now my directors are certainly supportive of the
actions that the federal reserve has taken particularly the stresstesting that we are doing of
banks and the longterm asset purchases  however they are concerned that the communications
about some of the other government programssome of the treasury planshave been unclear
and therefore are hampering the recovery  mr chairman i think that your interview on
60 minutes played a helpful role in clarifying some of these programs and i did receive many
calls from directors and business contacts saying that they thought the interview was well
received
like the staff i revised down my projection for output and inflation based on the
incoming data and obviously the weakening global outlook  my projection is very much in
line with the greenbook baseline although in my projection the unemployment rate peaks at
10 percent because i dont anticipate as much of a cutback in the participation rate as the
greenbook does  also i do think that the outlook calls for a larger policy response  in my
baseline ive incorporated the simulations on additional nontraditional policies  i know the
greenbook hasnt because they are obviously difficult to include in a numeric projection  but at
this point i have included some of that policy response in my outlook
in my view the risks remain very much weighted to the downside for both output and
inflation  given the repeated markdowns that weve made to our projections i think more
downside misses are likely to make it more difficult to restore confidence that we are dealing
with the economic crisis appropriately  at this point neither the projections nor any of the
anecdotal reports that i have received are likely to make a difference in or shift our policy
response  we are in the midst of an economic decline that doesnt have concrete signs of a
developing recovery  i think we need to react to the current crisis thoroughly but also with as
much as clarity as possible  i know weve talked a lot about the focus on our communications of
what we are doing  i do think that is critical at this point  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  i fully agree we are certainly in the midst of a
significant contraction  back in january when i submitted my forecast for the first half of the
year i had the economy declining at an annual rate of 4 percent which is now quite close to the
greenbook number the question ive been asking myself is  should i mark the forecast down
further and push the recovery off further  so far im not fully convinced that thats the right
response in part because as dave stockton noted the basic case for recovery is the same as it
has beenstimulative monetary and fiscal policy gradual further improvement in financial
market conditions and the internal dynamics associated with the corrections that occur during a
recession that is production and employment decline an inventory correction process occurs
ultimately aggregate supply falls below even diminished aggregate demand and then you have
set the stage for the expansion
moreover as a veteran of many many forecasting exercises ive seen some of this
phenomenon before  theres a tendency in the midst of a serious recession especially if youre
doing bottomup forecasting and going through the various components of aggregate demand
consumer spending on durables nondurables servicesto take a look at each component and
say to yourself well that cant get better any time soon  and by the time youve gone
through that youve eliminated all possibilities of any component getting better any time soon
so you wind up with a forecast with a very extended recession
finally theres only one other point id make  its not meant to provide a lot of comfort
but just to suggest that it wouldnt take all that much for the recovery to get under way in the
third quarter albeit initially quite sluggishly  i just did an arithmetic exercisethats all it is
and if consumer spending in the aggregate grew at 1 to 2 percent rate in the third and fourth
quarters that would turn those negative gdp numbers in the greenbook into slightly positive
gdp numbers  the only reason i make that point is that it wouldnt take all that much
consumer spending has shown some signs of leveling off so it may be that theres some silver
lining there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the clear deterioration in the real economic
outlook since our last meeting is consistent with the information we had from the fifth district
all our survey indexes remained at very low levels  the forwardlooking components of most
weakened as well  the carolinas have been particularly hardhit in recent months  their
economy is manufacturingintensive and exportoriented more so than the rest of the country
and their housing markets which had lagged the national cycle have weakened substantially in
the last year
i was pleasantly surprised by the retail sales numbers and the greenbooks improved
outlook for consumption expenditures which suggest that diminishing marginal returns to
cutbacks in discretionary spending may be setting in  im a little wary about making too much of
it  i think the weak labor market is going to weaken further and the possibility of further
declines in wealth could easily drive household spending down another step
id note though that in more normal times a significant deterioration in the forecast from
one greenbook to the next would bring with it a revision in the assumed policy path for the fed
funds rate  now that were at zero id expect a commensurate revision in the path for our
balance sheet  if im reading the greenbook correctly the staff hasnt made any change to their
baseline policy assumptions and i would have thought the greenbook would have built in more
expansion of credit programs or the monetary base or both
in this context its striking that as i mentioned yesterday the monetary base has
declined by 200 billion since the beginning of the year  im looking at daily averages over the
first two weeks of january versus the period ending i think march 11  i understand some big
mbs transactions settled on march 12 so theres a tiny little spike in the figures  but still that
was striking  the base obviously remains at a very high level consistent with our statements
but i wonder if that 200 billion decline means that we tightened policy since the beginning of
the year  i dont think we know one way or the other but id think we would want to make sure
we increase the base whenever the outlook deteriorates significantly  this is why i think it
would be useful for us to begin outright purchases of treasuries and moreover id like to
suggest that we explicitly direct the desk to make sure that the monetary base expands by a
significant amount during the policy periodmaybe even put the number into the directive for
the intermeeting period  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  the executive summary for my business
reports this round is  things have never been so bad  this view is essentially unchanged from
january they werent happy then either  these reports seem to represent a continuation of the
severe contraction rather than additional negative impulses  but thats not especially comforting
as this is shaping up to be the worst economic downturn since the 1930s  but president sterns
comments did make me feel better about the outlook so i certainly hope im wrong there
the greenbooks presentation of an unconstrained optimal monetary policy response was
striking in my opinion  the size of the policy gap is so large that quibbling over differences in
model specifications and the like seems beside the point  i was contemplating asking dave
stockton what it would take to generate inflationmaybe if potential output was less favorable
than we think thats how it would happen  but i couldnt imagine that the answer would change
my opinion because they had one scenario that went some ways towards that already  i think this
gap is representative of the tremendous amount of economic slack that we are facing  if
adequate policy actions are not forthcoming or are not feasible then larger and longerlasting
economic costs may be looming  many of my contacts noted that if the economy did not find a
bottom soon they would be in for another round of major reductions in productive capacity
they specifically noted the likelihood of cuts in core labor forces and capital infrastructures
these adjustments would be very costly to undo when the economy eventually recovers
the commentary i heard on financial market difficulties suggests that our credit policies
are now fighting against even greater headwinds than before but its unclear how we might
counteract this additional deterioration directly  in addition to continuing concerns about credit
supply more contacts are noting that the severe contraction is causing the credit quality of
borrowers to deteriorate  ford said that when theyre making auto loans the banks seemed to be
getting the bettercreditquality buyers at the moment but they said that their rejections on retail
financing were 50 percent now which is up 10 percentage points  federal reserve treasury
and fdic programs have eased credit supply conditions somewhat and hopefully will lead to
more improvement but the reduced creditworthiness looms as a potentially even larger problem
than restrictive credit supply
in terms of the likely effectiveness of the talf i heard a number of different
perspectives from my contacts  discover financial said the current talf spreads were too wide
to be attractive  nonetheless they thought the talf would be a useful backstop  they also said
they would consider using it especially if investors became willing to accept somewhat smaller
rates of return that is low doubledigit returns  investors in the middle of this transaction seem
to be doing very well without really accepting a lot of riskim not sure theyre bringing a lot to
the table frankly  ford was expecting to place several billion dollars of securities backed by
consumer auto loans with talf borrowers  they thought this would be quite helpful but on the
other hand both ford and gm indicated that they would like to use the talf to finance dealer
inventories  however the high cost for credit enhancements to secure a triplea rating would
make it uneconomical for them to do so
as a central bank our credit policies are necessarily conservative  they are aimed
primarily at improving credit supply conditions by lending on prudent terms  but what makes
the terms prudent to us results in many issuers seeing the talf as being too restrictive and on
unattractive terms  i said to one ceo who was complaining of this that if we were a private
financial company with this pricing policy we wouldnt last a week  indeed those firms with
access to the tlgp were unanimous in preferring that source of funding to the talf  several
of these also advocated expanding the borrowing capacity under the tlgp and firms without
access to the tlgp were lobbying to get in  such are the benefits and distortions of our public
programs  so my reading is that the prudent terms for the talf make it less attractive and
suggest its takeup rate and effectiveness may be limited  im not advocating changes
necessarilyim just reporting that its macroeconomic effectiveness may be smaller than the
economy needs
framing the monetary policy discussion with a viewpoint on the national economic
outlook is fairly simple this time  although i could cite some differences between my forecast
and the greenbooks projections these differences do not change three material observations
first enormous resource gaps through 2010 for sure will continue to require aggressive
monetary accommodation with nonstandard tools  second for the foreseeable future
disinflationary forces seem strong enough that aggressive monetary policy accommodation
would not impose undue risk to our price stability goal  third to offset these disinflationary
forces a sharp rise in inflation expectations would be necessary  i think it would have to be
exogenous  its not in my forecast  the circumstances by which this would occur are hard to
predict although commentators point to risks from the expansion of our balance sheet and future
fiscal deficits  i do not expect these will have a quantitatively important impact on inflation
expectations over the next couple of years
finally the greenbooks baseline is so dismal that with the unemployment rate headed
to 9 percent and a substantial disinflation in train even the most optimistic alternative
scenarios do not see an increase in the fed funds rate before 2013  this is sobering  none of us
are accustomed to thinking that a prolonged period of zero shortterm interest rates will be
associated with a lack of inflationary pressures  for virtually all of our contemporary monetary
memories inflation has been above desirable levels in the us  this is an enormous challenge to
our thinking and to our typical approaches to monetary policy strategy  indeed the frbus
calculations where inflation did overshoot were premised on the idea that these taylor shocks
would lead to an increase in inflationary expectations  that is that they are very
accommodative  but we dont see that in our analysis at the moment
i began to think about the policymaker who equally weights his or her displeasure on
either nairu or output and inflation gaps which are the underpinnings for the optimal policy in
the bluebook  were looking at an output gap in the greenbook of 8 percentage points so with
equally weighted displeasure you ought to be willing to accept inflation that is somewhat higher
than your target  given these large expected output gaps even a borderline inflation nutter
would be willing to accept a substantial risk of overshooting in the inflation target  so the
bottom line in my opinion is that a welldesigned program of substantial nontraditional
monetary accommodation in concert with clearly specified dual mandate goals and reasonable
safeguards will keep longterm inflation expectations anchored  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  in general i think the
greenbook baseline forecast is pretty sensible  the new york fed view is not much different
but echoing president sterns comments i can also tell a credible story of why the rate of
economic contraction first slows then the economy reverses direction as we move into the
second half of 2009  the inventory cycle turns from negative to positive the decline in housing
activity ends mainly because theres no room to fall further and fiscal stimulus provides support
to consumer spending and cushions the downward adjustment in state and local government
outlays  unfortunately that doesnt tell us much about 2010 and beyond  in my view the
longerterm outlook rests on the answers to two key questions  first what is the desired
household saving rate  where is it headed and how rapidly will we get there  or to put it
somewhat differently echoing president yellen where is the household sector in its
deleveraging process  and second will the financial system stabilize and credit availability
steadily improve over the next couple of quarters  of course these two interact  if we dont get
an improvement in credit availability asset prices will go down further and that will feed back
into the household saving rate
the fourthquarter flow of funds data were i think as expected  theyre going to show
this 9 percent drop in household net worth which brings the ratio of household net worth to
income back to levels not seen since the mid1990s  that would seem to imply that the
household saving rate which is currently around 5 percent will likely need to rise even further
and the question is  to what level  there has to be quite a bit of uncertainty about that both in
terms of where we are going and how fast we are going to get there  one possible benchmark
would be the household saving rate of the early 1990s which was slightly below 8 percent  if
thats where were headed id say thats probably doable while still having an economic
recovery although it is considerably higher than the greenbook forecast of 5 percent this year
and next  an 8 percent rate does not seem too high a bar given that we have a lot of fiscal
stimulus coming  the fact that most of the stimulus will be saved does not mean that the
stimulus has been ineffective since the counterfactual in this case might be that the households
would have had to reduce their spending in order to achieve their new desired level of savings
however one could argue that theres a risk that an 8 percent household saving rate may
be too low  demographics may imply the need for a higher saving rate now given that the
workingage population is much older now than it was in the 1990s in other words if we adjust
for the age mix of the population today an 8 percent figure back then might map into a 9 percent
or 10 percent figure today  if thats the case obviously the task is a bit more daunting  but the
bottom line is we simply do not know how older households are going to react to the wealth
losses that theyve experienced in terms of how much theyre going to raise their saving rate
whether theyre going to delay their retirement whether theyll have the opportunity to delay
their retirement and keep their jobs and whether theyll accept lower standards of living in
retirement  its just a huge open question
some commentators have set the bar much higher  they argue that the ratio of household
debt to income needs to fall back to levels of the mid1980s  thats a very high bar implying
the ratio would have to decline by more than half  it would suggest that the deleveraging process
of households has only just begun and that we have many many years of deleveraging ahead of
us  i think thats a bit too pessimistic a view for several reasons  over time the cost of financial
intermediation has fallen that implies to me a higher debttoincome ratio and a higher assetto
income ratio as well  second some of the changes in tax policy do encourage you to hold more
assets and more liabilities for example earlier you might have paid off your mortgage and now
you refinance your mortgage and instead fund your 401k plan  in that case your assets and
liabilities are both higher now relative to your income but you are not worse off  i expect well
see some further decline in the household debttoincome ratio but because i think the longer
term secular trend has been upward i dont think were going to need to see decadeslong
household deleveraging  at least i hope not
of course the difficulty in deleveraging will depend on the inflation outlook  i think
thats important  if we do fall into a debtdeflation dynamic then as income drops real debt
burdens will increase and it will become even more difficult for households to deleverage even
if they want to  so that just underscores why we need to do everything we can to minimize the
risk of a deflation outcome  the second key issue is of course the stability of the financial
system  without this i dont think we can have a sustainable recovery  yes the economy could
improve a little bit during the second half of 2009 but if we dont fix the financial system and its
ability to intermediate between savers and borrowers i suspect 2010 will be very disappointing
this is why the downside risks to the forecast still are predominant in our views at the new york
fed  the fomc and the board should concentrate on taking whatever steps are needed to
improve market functioning and the viability of the large banks which lie at the core of the
financial system  this implies expansion of our liquidity programs such as the talf and at
minimum increased purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities  it also implies support for
the treasurys cap which is designed to get additional capital into the banking system as well
as a willingness to extend our suite of 133 activities and our foreign exchange swap programs
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i agree with the general sentiments around the
table  the economy is falling further and faster than we thought it would  we see some signs of
stability as president plosser pointed out in consumption and even in housing but these are very
tentative and at a very low level i think even if household spending were to level out and get a
little boost from fiscal policy in coming quarters the economy would continue to fall further at
least for a little while  business investment is very weak and will continue to decline in response
to previous downshifts in sales through the multiplieraccelerator effects and in response to tight
credit and very constrained credit availability  i was surprised in looking at the investment chart
in greenbook part 2 to see that the cost of credit has actually risen substantially for businesses at
a time when thats obviously counterproductive  global demand shows no signs of stabilizing
and will continue to depress exports as steve was telling us especially in light of the stronger
dollar which just adds further downward pressure there
to me perhaps the most troubling developments have been in the financial sector
maybe thats because im spending my days and nights worrying about them  there has been a
tightening of financial conditions over the intermeeting period even as the economy has
weakened  the dollar has increased equity markets have fallen and interest rates including the
riskfree rate have risen in recent weeks  i think theres a growing lack of confidence in
financial institutions  this is not just a us phenomenon its a global phenomenal trishs chart
showed increases in cds spreads everywhereeurope uk us asiaeverywhere  i think
the recession is spreading more and more into the loan books of these banks globally and thats
undermining confidence despite government efforts everywhere to try to shore up confidence
we used to talk about resilience in the economythat was part of president sterns
discussion of why economies bounce backbut i think part of the natural equilibrating
mechanisms involves expectations that things will get better that is people spend based on that
expectation  as president bullard pointed out expectations about the future are very depressed
and i agree  uncertainty is extremely high and people dont know what to expect so theyre not
taking risks and thats impeding the bounceback in the economy  governments responses to
the difficulties are certainly contributing to this uncertainty  again this is not a us
phenomenon  i think governments everywhere are having trouble finding their footing about
what to do here  these are very difficult issues without obviously correct answers and
responses and therefore you see changes in approaches in various jurisdictions not just in the
us
i think weve got a difficult witchs brew here  theres populist anger constraining
policy options  we need the smartest people in the country in our troubled financial institutions
and in our government working on solutions and were driving them away from both of those
institutions every day  i think the set of circumstances implies that improvement in the financial
sector is likely to be quite slow and halting at a minimum  lenders and investors are becoming
more wary and less confident  weve got the risk of a further major deterioration in the financial
sector where the failure of several large institutions is a nontrivial risk and could be brought on
by government policies
i think the projection of stabilization of demand in the second half and recovery next year
is reasonable as fiscal policy kicks in and assuming financial stability but the downside
economic and financial risks are very very large  and even if the economy stabilizes in the
second half of the year were starting at a much lower level with a very high output gap  so i
agree with others who have pointed to the risk of deflation and the interaction of that risk with
the high levels of debt in the household sector as a very grave danger going forward  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me discuss four points  first the
economy in the near term with an emphasis on nonus second mediumterm implications of
all these policy responses for the trend growth in productivity third financial markets and
fourth briefly financial institutions
on the economy the real economy is deteriorating globally as everyone has said  i think
the hard question is whether the pace of deterioration is slowing and i suspect the answer is no
its not  national capitals including our own do not seem to be capable in times like this for
many of the reasons don has described of slowing that deterioration  if anything some actions
seem to be giving rise to more uncertainty and greater weakness  dave stockton talked in detail
about the data on spending and production which continue to be poor revealing the weakness in
our economy and labor markets to be broad and deep  in the rest of the world the deterioration
as has been discussed is probably broader probably deeper and more troubling still probably
even less likely to receive effective responses  the secondderivative question there is clear  if
anything the problems overseas are accelerating  the total collapse in global trade is well
understood at this point
the hard piece for me to get my arms around is  what are the second and thirdorder
effects of this weakness in global markets in global economies and what could lead in the near
term to significant political policy and balanceofpower challenges around the world  are we
entering a period of instability that makes the rest of the worlds economies even more
vulnerable than they have been in recent years to exogenous shocks  and i dont think it takes
an incredible imagination to think about what those could be  the unwinding of fiscal
imbalances is happening fast but the deterioration across our economies is happening even
faster  the delta i suspect is a breakdown in confidence and the risk of policy failures which
are exacerbating the situation  perhaps its true that the current account surplus countries are at
greater risk than the deficit countries
the g20 meetings of this last weekend were i would say different in a couple respects
from prior international meetings  for example six months ago there continued to be a sort of
schadenfreude about the us some sense that people think the us is getting what it deserves
that is nowhere in the room at this point  there is a worldwide need for us leadership a need
for the us economy to recover with great strength and a rooting for the us  i think most of
the other g20 members were of the view that if the us does not get this thing turned around
they are going to be in a very dire situation even more dire than under current prospects  in
addition i thought that the most interesting topic was what was discussed only in the most
hushed tones at these meetings and that was eastern europe  it was still not allowed to be
discussed broadly because i think the fears were so so significant  almost every other issue was
put squarely on the table for a broad discussion but the banking problems in eastern europe
were hidden from public view and that was more troubling than i had thought even before i
went into the meeting
second in terms of the mediumterm economy here in the us i thought that the
adverse supply condition scenario in the greenbook was quite indicative of more damaging risks
the misallocation of labor and capital across the economy merits some responsibility for this
recession and getting that allocation back to equilibrium is what recessions are all about  its not
obvious that is happening at least at this point  capital is not finding its way to anything close to
its most efficient uses  labor markets are not able to dynamically adjust  and these problems
are likely to be particularly pervasive as the path to a new architecture for credit intermediation
remains unclear  i think over time the real risk is that we are going to end up with less trend
productivity less growth and a higher nairu  policy actions seem unconducive to restoration
of the growth rates that we have come to expect in recent years
third let me talk about financial markets  i think financial market functioning is as poor
as governor kohn described  policy uncertainty has become the watchword not just for the real
economy but for financial markets and i suspect that when we look at cds spreads for large
financial institutions notwithstanding the commitments that this institution and the treasury
have given what markets have come to determine is that the congress will be calling the shots
and that is a problem  i think markets are very uncertain when there are 435 leaders in one body
and 100 in another about exactly what might come out of that and the idea that there might be
one party in control of government does not seem to be enough to drive leadership in a single
direction  thus im not taking too much signal from the improvement in markets in recent days
backlogs around financings are perhaps better than they were a week or two ago and in fact a
large pharmaceutical company last night priced a range of debt securities at impressive spreads
im really suspicious about whether a deal like that will be able to be done in the next couple of
weeks and so i think the backlogs are a big question
let me turn then finally to financial institutions as they relate to financial markets  i
concur wholeheartedly with what president rosengren said earlier  i worry very much that the
policy response thats going to come from washington in the next several days and weeks will
not be well received will require another pivot and there might well be litigation around that  i
think that is very very damaging  i think we are entering a period in the next couple of weeks
that could well determine the strength in the economy in the next couple of quarters and i think
as governor kohn said expectations in the real economy are confused because government
actions in the name of boldness seem to be quite ambiguous  that is a very very difficult
combination  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  im going to talk again about the banks and as
a reminder these are the traditional commercial banks and its a variety of them just below the
top four across the country in varying conditions and of different sizes  of that group four are
subject to the stress test and in talking to them this time id note that ive never ever talked to
bankers where the conversation was so much about government and so little about the banking
business particularly given what theyre facing right now
with the four banks that are subject to the stress test i first asked them what the process
was and i got three different answersso they didnt even quite understand what it was they
were being asked to do  two of them were convinced that its a trojan horse for nationalization
several of them questioned whether this test is even going to have credibility in the marketplace
once it gets done thinking its possible that those who are shown to be weak will simply have
confirmed suspicions but those who are shown to be strong will not get any boost in confidence
from that  also theres a concern that theyll be at a standstill for the six months that have been
given in order to raise private capital because even if they passeven if theyre not to get any
government capitalif they go out to get private capital then it looks like they are doing that
only to avoid getting the public capital so basically they cannot go to the capital market  private
capital is absolutely unwilling to come in until their status is assured and is not willing at this
point to be a minority partner with the united states government  weve talked a lot about
confidence and one issue is that we have no confidence in our banks ourselves as a government
so its very hard to engender public confidence in those banks
politics and bonuses particularly with respect to the original tarp i capital  that
capital now feels completely stigmatized  banks thought it would be a sign of strength  the
public perception is that theyve been bailed out  the nondeductible dividend the political
strings attached and the unknown future combine to make many of them as president plosser
said want to give it back  given the events of this week i think aig first nearly took out the
financial system and now may make it impossible for us to do any form of financial rescue
there was a letter from the special inspector general for tarp that went to all of the banks  it
was a prosecutorialsounding letter demanding to know exactly what they had done with every
dollar that they had received from the government  they found that almost impossible to
respond to but all of them are working on it
the executive compensation restrictions  the ceos are not concerned about their own
pay and theyre not concerned about that of their top lieutenants  what they are concerned
about is their top revenueproducers who are being actively recruited by nonbanks and in some
cases larger banks these people might be in the top 25 in a small bank but if they go to a larger
bank they would no longer be part of the top 25  at another bank the chief of credit is retiring
and the ceo does not think that he can find a replacement under the executive compensation
restrictions  the rules are unclear  theyre still waiting for the treasury to publish the
regulations and they dont know for example what the effective date is  some of them wonder
whether theyre going to have to take back the 2008 bonuses already paid  there are questions
about vesting  if the vesting cannot occur until the tarp money is paid back does that mean
they cannot vest 100 percent or does that mean they can only partially vest  if they vest 100
percent once the capital is paid out what is that going to do to the income statements  two of
them were deferring their stockholders meeting until the proxy rules became clearer
the removal of requirements for paying the tarp capital back which was part of the
last fiscal recovery plan  investors already viewed this as temporary and therefore they were
treating it as a loan rather than capitalhence the focus on tangible common equity  now its
clearly temporary clearly a loan and clearly not capital  one of the banks said that they were
getting calls from numerous private equity firms which they originally would never have talked
to saying once you get through the stress test if you want to give the tarp capital back we
will come in  ordinarily they would not have taken it but now theyre looking at that as an
option  the chairman said in his interview on 60 minutes that a sign of the economy recovering
would be a major institution getting private capitalyou may get that wish  all but one
expressed the absolute desire to repay and that is what theyre focused on  the one that was not
going to repay is going to put itself in a position to repay and just simply not pay it back until as
he said the clouds part and the sun shines  so no banks are willing to leverage it further and
get into a position of needing to keep it  so its not doing any good  it is not performing any
function except sitting there as a standby
capital stories  one bank was contacted by anotherboth were fairly goodsized banks
and they talked for a good amount of time  it was a good strategic fit  there was no issue with
price  there were no social issues  however it required additional capital and they turned it
down  another one had been in detailed talks with the fdic about taking over a problem bank
the deal included taking additional tarp in order to make the deal work  they notified the
fdic that they were standing down they no longer wanted to have anything to do with that
and finally a bank that had not taken any of the government capital had sold trust preferred and
common with just a few phone calls last year  this year the only buyers are the nonpublic
investors because theyre worried about mark to market and otti and they will not invest if
tarp capital is present  now the trust preferred will be priced at 11 to 12 percent fixed with
warrants last year that price was libor plus 375
the bottom line is that the political and public perception right now precludes the use of
government capital for healthy banks and the presence of public capital has put private capital
further out of reach  all of that being said i still believe when we look back on this episode we
will determine that the injection of capital into the banks kept us from a meltdown  but well
also conclude that the public outcry forced the capital back out again  my most optimistic
projection is that it will be replaced sooner than anticipated with internal and private sources and
that banks will then learn to work with the capital thats available to them
in terms of the fdic the restriction and higher fees for issuance of the tlgp are causing
banks to speed up issuance  they originally thought they had a period of time and the
investment bankers were feeding these issues out in sort of a measured way  now they all feel
like they have to issue before april 1 before the price goes up  banks did not see the fdic
increase in the premiums and the special assessment coming  most of them of course believe
that theyre paying for the bailouts of large banks in some way and it wipes out a significant
portion if not all of quarterly earnings
now to the bankruptcy cramdown for prime jumbo and all types of securitizations
the bankruptcy cramdown will alter the order of payments so that the losses are then shared
equally by all tranches rather than in order  this is going to further reduce the value of triplea
tranches of those and the staff estimates thats a market of about 600 billion in securities
the federal home loan banks  the seattle bank became the first to exhaust its retained
earnings  theyre primarily marktomarket losses and its making the case that theyre not real
losses  but the question is  what does this mean for valuation of the stock that the banks hold
stock ownership is a requirement for borrowing so anybody whos borrowing from federal
home loan banks also owns that stock  the advances are getting significantly more expensive
this is not an issue just for small banksthe top 10 banks have 20 percent of the advances from
federal home loan banks  bankers banks and corporate credit unions i think pose similar
risks for smaller institutions
fair value accounting is still the number one concern in the industry  i would look to see
what happens with the impact of the revised standards on the first quarter  that could be very
helpful although banks that took big losses in the fourth quarter dont get to reverse them
lets switch just a minute now and talk about whats actually going on in the banking
book  deposits are growing in some cases significantly  transactions as consumers change
their behavior are down significantly as are overdrafts  in the loan area demand is down
sharply  consumer and small business applications are up a bit but the approval rates are down
about 10 percent as you said  in terms of home equity loans the reasons for the denials are
primarily issues with debttoincome ratios and appraisals  one thing that consumer groups in
here in last week reminded me ofwhich i had forgotten and shouldnt haveis that home
equity is a primary funding source for small businesses not sba loans  we tend to look at home
equity as a consumer loan but it is really small business financing  in terms of business loans
they are down from lack of income and in many cases actually outright losses
in the construction loan area they are still working through the existing residential
construction loans and dealing with lots and lots of lots  theres not much new commercial
constructionits primarily medical or educational facilities  and there is no takeout for
completed construction  some banks are pulling away from loan products segments industries
or geographic areas  others are taking the best of the deals and underwriting them individually
for example if somebody says im getting out of all deals to a given segment a smaller bank
will come in and underwrite them individually and take the best of those deals  those are the
ones that are growing their loans
student loans  they were already low margin due to a mismatch in reference rates  the
banks are currently doing more volume than they want and they seem delighted to hear that the
federal budget is taking them out of the student loan business
mortgages  the application volume slowed when rates picked up and its still primarily
refinancings
loan modifications  the gse and service portfolios were modified but they are
concerned about the longterm effect of the very low rates with the ceiling for their own book
credit quality  delinquencies continue to rise  theyre starting to sell properties at the
same rate theyre bringing in new ones  the growth in loans that are ninety days past due are
primarily loans that are in the process of modification  the commercial loans are the ones
showing real trouble right now and as i said yesterday commercial real estate loans are really
just business loans  the repayment and the collateral value of those loans depend on the
business cash flows and the appraisals right now are stunningly low  many retail stores are
closing  others are on percentage rent so that cash flows do drop with sales  some centers are
one tenant away from disaster  hospitality is suffering from not only the recession but the
stigma  in hawaii they are having 10 million a week in cancellations
the banks though are not foreclosing  in this case they are modifying offering reduced
payments and putting on nonaccrual as long as the operator will continue to operate because
they dont want those properties back  some banks are actually incentivizing their loan officers
to move loans out rather than to bring loans in  some banks are offering to settle performing
loans at a discount in order to get them off the books  one bank is considering making jumbo
loans at conforming rates on its own books to diversify its borrower risk and reduce the
inventory of construction loans  with the residential construction loans you almost get an
impression of a store thats getting ready to go out of business and hasnt been able to buy new
inventory  the inventory they have is not the inventory thats selling and its just sitting there
on the shelves
in terms of auto loans there are lower losses on cars that are coming off lease  the
wholesale inventories are firming up and i think that would show through to new cars by the
third quarter  rental agencies are trimming their fleets by about 20 percent  dealers cant sell
so they are looking to manufacturers to repurchase the inventory  a lexus dealer said he has
customers who normally would buy on a regular basis and can afford to buy but are worried
about the appearance of buying in a situation where people are losing their jobs
the boat inventory is aging  its now three years old and ge capital is the only
company financing boats
borrowers do not expect to have to pay  one ceo was at his neighbors house which
she had just purchased for 16 million  the neighbor showed the improvements that she was
making and then asked who the modification officer at the bank was because she wanted to
modify the mortgage on her vacation home  another ceo had a private banking client come in
who had purchased a home with a private banking loan for 2 million in 2005  the loan was
interest only for a million and a half  at one point the client got a 3 million offer and turned it
down  now the property is for sale at 1 million and the client said he would continue to make
the payments if they reduced the loan to 750000
theres a huge increase in fraud  floor plan and wire transfer were the two that were
mentioned
in summary right now im really not hearing much about bankspecific issues that are
impediments to lending  deposits are high  government liquidity is cheap and plentiful  the
primary reasons for not lending are related to creditworthiness and concern about economic
conditions and collateral values  banks are reducing credit line availability but it is due to
concerns about credit and collateral  loans are difficult for larger amounts for creditonly
customers for those with high debttoincome ratios or weak credit histories for those who have
little equity and for any construction loan  finally theres sticker shock  i dont think the banks
will ever go back to lending at the spreads typical before this episode so many of those who
think that they cant get credit are concerned more about the cost of credit and i think those high
loan spreads are here to stay
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  not surprisingly my assessment of the
economy and the financial sector converges with those that have already been expressed  so let
me just quickly make a few additional observations that support the hypothesis of an even longer
period for stabilization and recovery than reflected in the greenbook forecast and thus even
greater vulnerability for the economy for some time to come
i begin with an admittedly speculative point about the domestic labor market but one that
complements some earlier comments by presidents yellen and evans  it appears to me that an
unusual number of industries will be undergoing major structural adjustments during the course
of this downturn and as a result may not rehire at the rate that might be expected in a cyclical
rebound  these industries are two groups  one consists of industries like construction and
financial services that were directly involved in the asset bubbles associated with the financial
crisis  it seems likely that overcapacity in those industries so far exceeded sustainable demand
that the postrecession employment profile will be substantially rather than just moderately
below precrisis levels  a second group consists of industries that even in the middle part of the
decade had seen significant pressure on their business models  companies and sectors as
diverse as autos media legal services and retail were already in the process of consolidation
andor downsizing  this process has clearly accelerated under the weight of the contraction in
real gdp  there are good reasonsanecdotal i admit but good reasons nonethelessto
believe that to a greater or lesser degree each of these industries will emerge from this recession
permanently leaner than they were and some may be fundamentally changed  this observation
is as i noted to date unsupported by even raw data much less by systematic comparison with
earlier severe recessions  but if my intuition is buttressed by such an analysis elevated
unemployment levels may be stickier for a longer time than we now anticipate  the emergence
of new firms and industries that might normally be expected to pick up some of the slack will at
the same time be hindered by continuing dysfunction in financial markets
i have some very different observations about the international economy but im afraid
with similar implications for the shape of the gdp growth curve  the downward revisions of
economic performance abroad do not seem to have been met with a sense of policy urgency in
many countries particularly with respect to nonmonetary policy measures in the advanced
foreign economies  indeed my conclusion from my week in europe was not dissimilar to that of
governor warsh  i observed in addition that there has been a kind of collective decision among
policymakers to put on a relatively happy face publicly while being unable privately to offer any
grounds for optimism  in formal comments and public utterances a number of policymakers
made reference to wholly adequate stimulus measures  they discounted the significance of
increased bank cds spreads or in at least one case commented on the wonderful bargains
available to those who still had jobs  this attitude is of particular concern because as steve
kamin mentioned the effects of stimulus measures in many advanced foreign economies are
substantially frontloaded into 2009
whether because of policy paralysis in the face of daunting challenges or in some cases
because of the weak political circumstances of incumbent governments too many countries seem
unable or unwilling to elevate their responses to rapidly deteriorating conditions  i worry that a
similar hesitancy to take forceful steps could lead to inadequate responses to contingencies such
as widespread banking problems in emerging markets  an absence of confidence in the political
strength of the government can also push officials towards more serious consideration of
measures such as shifts in foreign exchange policies which may relieve a certain amount of
domestic pain by shifting it elsewhere in a neutral or even negativesum fashion
my concerns about this issue have increased dramatically in the last week  many
emerging markets have limited capacity to help themselves given their own fiscal and monetary
constraints  one major exception of course is china  yet even china seems to be relying in the
medium term on a rebound in advanced foreign economies that would restore many of the
exports lost in recent months  while that approach worked well for countries coming out of the
asian financial crisis in 1999 it was built on the strength of largely unaffected american and
european economies  obviously demand in our economies will be weak for quite some time
moreover the continued problems in our financial sectors imply that capital flows to emerging
markets are unlikely to pick up as they did following the asian financial crisis
despite these impediments to a reasonably fastpaced return to conditions promoting
rapid emerging market growth theres little indication in china or elsewhere that policymakers
have used the crisis to accelerate shifts in their own growth models away from a high level of
export dependence  coupled with what is at least for the present a somewhat passive policy
instinct in some advanced economies international developments may like our domestic
employment situation suggest a more prolonged and shaky recovery period  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  i understand coffee is ready  why dont we
take a 20minute break
coffee break
chairman bernanke  let me start by trying to summarize the discussion around
the table and then ill give a few additional comments  the group agreed that the economic
outlook has worsened significantly and although it wasnt noted we have seen very sharp
declines in both the fourth and the first quarters  the slowdown is widespread across sectors and
has included not only such areas as construction manufacturing and retail but also hospitality
shipping and to some extent energy agriculture and other areas  a notable development has
been declines abroad which have been exceptionally severe and which together with the
stronger dollar are hurting us exports  there was a view on the part of some that there might
be some stabilization later this year  factors that might promote a weak recovery later this year
or in 2010 include fiscal policy monetary stimulus improvements of financial markets slower
declines in housing and working out of the inventory cycle  however i have to say that there
wasnt much conviction behind this view and some saw at best an lshaped recovery
risks clearly remain to the downside and a protracted period of economic weakness
remains a significant possibility reflecting factors such as an ongoing lack of confidence in
government policy general uncertainty need for economic restructuring and the ongoing
deleveraging process by both financial institutions and households  international prospects may
not be much better as other countries also face needs for restructuring and many are having
inadequate policy responses  consumption data improved slightly in january and february but
consumption fundamentals remain quite weak  declines in wealth have been sharp and have led
consumers to attempt to repair balance sheets by increasing their saving  the labor market is
shedding jobs rapidly and substantial job losses may continue for a while  fiscal stimulus was
mentioned  housing starts and permits have increased a bit and the administrations
foreclosure mitigation plan may also be of some help in the housing market  nevertheless
housing continues to disappoint to the downside in general and house prices continue to fall  it
was noted that declines in house prices affect not only the rates of residential construction but
also consumer wealth as well as the quality of assets that are held by financial institutions
in the financial sector many credit markets especially those in which the fed has
intervened remained fairly stable in the intermeeting period despite worsening economic news
and some highly rated corporations have issued debt  however confidence in the banking
system has deteriorated as reflected for example in widening cds spreads  lending is down
reflecting in part credit supply constraints as well as lower loan demand and bank concerns
about credit quality and about the economy in general  participants remain concerned about the
effects of lack of financing on the commercial real estate sector in particular  the success of
government actions to stabilize the banking system remains an important factor in the outlook
theres a great deal of public skepticism about government efforts in this regard as well as
populist reaction
industrial production has fallen sharply both here and abroad as global trade declines
managers remain pessimistic and uncertain about prospects for sales prices and employment
and are prepared to cut employment and investment further if improvement does not materialize
demand for new capital goods remains weak as capacity utilization has set a postwar low
credit constraints are perceived to be an important problem
most participants expect inflation to remain very low for a time and some are concerned
about the risk for deflation including falling wages  deflationary trends could result in a
deflation trap or a debtdeflation dynamic  expectations of inflation but also general economic
conditions will clearly play an important role going forward
those are some of the things i took away from the discussionim sure i left out many
points  are there any comments  no response
let me just add a bit to that  i dont have a great deal to say  as everyone noted the
intermeeting news was generally disappointingbelow expectations  its notable that in
december we thought things were bad enough to cut rates to zero and in the last two meetings
the changes in the outlook both times have been quite negative  in particular like the rest of the
world the us economy experienced very sharp declines in the fourth quarter and apparently
now in the first quarter
perhaps the most striking development since the last meeting is the weakening of the
global economy  its really quite remarkable how quickly that happened  many of you have
experienced being abroad and hearing people say that on tuesday things looked okay and on
thursday a sudden chill hit the atmosphere and theres been a tremendous decline since then  i
think one interpretation of the worsening of our outlook is that in fact the shock that hit the
world economy in september and october was a truly enormous shock and that we have been
slow in understanding how big it was and how persistent it was  so in some sense its not that
weve had new shocks but rather that we are just coming to the point of understanding how bad
that shock was
there were of course a few glimmers of positive news and president stern and others
made note of that  there were some indications of stabilization in consumption in january and
february and that is before the actual fiscal stimulus kicks in which may be of some help unless
you think people are anticipating it which is possible  that seemed to happen last spring
actually  also we saw a bit of improvement in the housing starts and the permits yesterday  so
theres a little good news there but like most people i wouldnt want to take too much of a
signal from that  first of all both of these data sets are very volatile month to month and they
suffer from a great deal of seasonality and other factors  but more importantly given the size of
the shock that the world economy apparently was hit with in the fall theres going to be an
unavoidable cyclical dynamic thats just going to have to work its way out  theres almost
nothing that can be done at this point to avoid it
in particular consumer spending may stabilize but its going to be facing very
substantial headwinds including the familiar list of further stock price declines house price
declines ongoing job losses confidence declines and the same factors that weve talked about
id reiterate also the point that the vice chairman made about the saving rate  we have a recent
reading of about 5 percent in the household saving rate  that was possibly to some extent
exaggerated by temporary increases in income  if the consumer wants to maintain that saving
rate or go higher it suggests a relatively weak consumption profile going forward
moreover even if consumption stabilizes the rest of the dynamic is still very powerful
inventories for examplethe inventory profile looks worse than it did at the last meeting in the
sense that the overhang seems to be greater than we thought it might have been and therefore
the cycle will take longer to work its way through  i talked about this at the last meeting  at the
last meeting we had inventory dynamics leading possibly to slightly positive economic growth
by the third quarter  those dynamics now look distinctly less favorable  inventory investment is
likely to be negative throughout the rest of the year  it may add to growth in the sense it will be
less negative going forward but certainly that dynamic is going to be a very powerful one for
some time
the other dynamics that have been talked about around the table include investment  we
could hardly expect strong investment in the context of declining output a postwar low in
capacity utilization credit constraints uncertainty et cetera  with investment continuing to be
quite weak final sales will be weak and therefore the inventory dynamic will be stretched out
theres also of course an employment dynamic to the extent that the employment levels are
above the sustainable levels from the perspective of individual firms  as the continued
economic weakness is perceived well see further job losses and further dynamic adjustment
i would reiterate the importance of the global decline  steve talked about the
implications for contributions to gdp of the swing in exports from early last year until now and
there obviously is not going to be major change in that in the near term
and finally there was a lot of discussion around the table which i would reiterate about
financial conditions  there is some improvement or at least some stabilization in some credit
markets  i think that were certainly better off than we were at the beginning of the shock in
september and october but banks are under exceptional stress  the cds spreads were
mentioned  the political situation is very adverse in terms of ensuring that the government will
have the resources and support to take the necessary action to get the banking system stabilized
thinking about the alternative simulations in the greenbook i think delayed financial repair
might well be one that we would want to consider  the experience of other countries and other
episodes is that that leads at best to a period of stagnation if not to further decline
i dont want to be completely bleak  like others i saw a few positive signs  theres
some indication that the free fall of the fourth quarter and first quarter might be moderating to
some extent particularly in consumer spending  if thats so and if fears of a depression or some
extreme event begin to wane we may see some stabilization of final demand which then will
feed into the inventory and investment dynamic over time  but under any circumstances and
particularly if the banking situation is not resolved in a favorable way i think we can expect to
see very large output gaps develop and a very sustained weak condition for the economy
that obviously has implications for inflation  as i mentioned last time deflation per se
is not necessarily the issue  the fact is that as disinflation progresses that itself will raise real
interest rates and exacerbate to some extent the debt issues and the housingvaluation issues
so putting that all together as many people discussed yesterday i do think that some
aggressive policies may be called for today and with that ill stop and turn to brian to introduce
the policy round
mr madigan5   as indicated by the greenbook and by your discussion this morning the economic outlook has deteriorated markedly over the intermeeting period  at the same time the options for applying additional stimulus quickly appear limited  it now seems likely that the talf will lift off only slowly  and prospects for the enactment of additional fiscal stimulus at least in the near term appear dim in these circumstances consideration of further monetary stimulus through large scale asset purchases would seem to be warranted  the bluebook presented two policy alternatives a and b that involved additional asset purchases and one alternative c that would not involve further stimulative measures  i will focus my remarks this morning on alternatives a and b  this morning we have proposed revisions to the draft statements the revised statements are provided in the package that was distributed to you earlier labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives
i will begin with alternative a on page 2  under this alternative the rationale sectionparagraphs 1 and 2would note that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the nearterm economic outlook has worsened  it would point to a number of indicators of the economic weakness  paragraph 1 would end on a note of some optimism by stating that the policy actions taken to stabilize financial markets and institutions together with fiscal and monetary stimulus will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth  paragraph 2 would note the committees expectation that inflation will remain subdued dropping the phrase in coming quarters that was used in the january statement consistent with a view that inflation could be low for some time  indeed it would again cite some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term  as president fisher noted the rationale section provides a rather downbeat reading on the economy but perhaps one that is realistic
in the policy paragraph alternative a would again indicate the committees intention to employ all available tools  it says that the committee will hold the federal funds rate range at 0 to  percent and indicates an expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period  this phrase would suggest a longer interval than the phrase for

5  materials used by mr madigan are appended to this document appendix 5
some time used in january and suggested for alternative b  to provide additional economic stimulus the committee would take three policy actions under alternative a  increasing the amount of its agency mbs purchases by 500 billion to a total of
1 trillion this year increasing the amount of its purchases of agency debt securities by 100 billion to a total of 200 billion this year the boost to agency debt purchases is an addition relative to the alternative presented in the bluebook and initiating purchases of longerterm treasury securities that are to total 300 billion over the next six months
this paragraph would also note that the talf has been launched  the statement would conclude by indicating that the committee will be carefully monitoring the systems balance sheet and by suggesting some predilection toward stepping up its balance sheet expansion by noting that it will be assessing whether a faster pace of asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions and supporting economic activity  a possible downside of including such language is that it suggests a possible course of action that the committee may end up not pursuing
alternative b on the next page begins with a rationale section paragraphs 1 and 2 that is identical to that proposed for alternative a  however under alternative b the committee would not initiate purchases of treasury securities  rather it would more than double its purchases of agency mbs securities to a total of 125 trillion this year and double its purchases of agency debt securities to 200 billion  this alternative would not include anything comparable with the final clause of alternative a indicating that the committee was inclined to further step up its asset purchases
in summary alternative a would constitute a somewhat more aggressive expansion of the fomcs asset purchases than alternative b  the differences in terms of total asset purchases are small  alternative a would commit to an expansion of your asset purchases by a total of 900 billion whereas the increase under alternative b would be just slightly less at 850 billion  however as i noted the language of alternative a would be more forwardleaning with respect to possible future increases in asset purchases  and the initiation of treasury purchases might suggest to market participants that the committees operations could be expanded particularly in that direction in the future
the key difference between alternative a and alternative b really is whether or not to purchase treasury securities  to review the arguments for and against such purchases you might be inclined to proceed with purchases of longerterm treasury securities if you  believe that the economic situation had deteriorated so substantially that you did want to apply all available tools as indicated in your previous statement feel that it might be helpful to diversify the tools that you are applying to the situation believe that purchasing treasury securities rather than private securities is preferable to minimize the federal reserves involvement in credit allocation or think it might be easier to unwind in the future holdings of treasury securities than
holdings of private securities such as mbs which might be less liquid or might be seen in the future as tied particularly to primary mortgage market conditions
on the other hand you might be inclined not to purchase longerterm treasury securities if  you think that purchases of private securities such as mbs would more effectively improve conditions in private credit markets and thus provide better support to private spending or you are concerned that market participants might believe that you are monetizing the federal debt a perception that might lead to adverse effects on term premiums or perhaps on inflation expectations
under alternative c page 4 the committee would make no adjustment to the policy tools that it is already implementing and it would not reference any modification to the federal reserves liquidity programs other than those that have been previously announced  instead the statement would indicate that the committee decided to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and indicate that it continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time  the second paragraph would note that the nearterm economic outlook is poor but indicate that the committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year subject to significant downside risks  the final paragraph of the announcement would note the range of policy actions that are already in train
the bluebook also presented an alternative structure for the fomc statement based on a suggestion provided by president bullard  applying that structure to alternative a and incorporating this mornings suggested revisions to the policy actions is shown on page 5 as alternative a  a is substantively the same as a but it reorders the statement such that the committees actions are presented first  in particular the first sentence of the statement indicates that the federal open market committee decided today to increase the size of the federal reserves balance sheet further by purchasing 300 billion of longerterm treasury securities over the next six months and by acquiring an additional 500 billion of agency mbs and 100 billion of agency debt securities this year  obviously this approach gives greater prominence not only to the actions themselves but also to their effect on the committees balance sheet  conversely this approach gives less prominence to the very downbeat summary of the economic situation in paragraphs 2 and 3 a possible advantage of this approach  however the flow of the statement may be seen as a bit less logical in that it presents the committees actions before discussing the economic conditions that motivated them
alternatives b and c pages 6 and 7 apply the same structure to alternatives b and c
the final three sections of the package provide draft directives for the three basic alternatives and their primed variants
chairman bernanke  thank you brian  are there questions  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  brian in the bluebook and yesterday we saw
a chart of how the unemployment rate and the inflation rate would play out under these different
strategies  my question is about alternative a the largest program that were considering  is it
plausiblelikelypossible that what were looking at here would be enough  would the markets
look at this and think that the fomc has taken actions that it believes if the outlook doesnt
deteriorate further would be enough
mr madigan  youre asking about how the markets would interpret this
mr evans  is it likely that the committee would be willing to see this as large enough
to put us in a good position and wed just wait for confirmation of the outlook  are we even
close to that
mr madigan  judging by the simulations that were presented in the bluebook i
would say that this alternative a is roughly comparable to the green dashdotted line on page 32
if you happen to have that in front of you  its roughly the same size with a slightly different
composition  so the effects on interest rates might be similar  of course that would not get the
committee on this analysis to something comparable to the unconstrained policy
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  a twohanded intervention
vice chairman dudley  a quick question  the directives have up to and the
statements do not have up to  is that important  is that intentional
mr madigan  no thats not intentional  thank you  we should correct it
chairman bernanke  a question from president fisher
mr fisher  may i just ask mr chairman a question of ms mosser  every one of
these statements says that weve launched the term assetbacked securities loan facility  could
you just give us a quick update of where we stand on that because the wording here might be
questioned
ms mosser  because the deadline is tomorrow not surprisingly we have no one who
has signed on the dotted line  we have however three very serious issuestwo of them auto
related one of them credit cardrelatedthat appear at this stage pretty likely to go through
there do seem to be at least enough customertodealer contracts signed or in the process of
being signed  my ballpark guesstimate based on the numbers ive seen is 5 billioncould be
8 billiontotal  quite frankly before the machinations of the last week and a half i dont
think we truly anticipated more than 5 to 10 billion in the first subscription  theres been no
price discovery in this market for several months  and just on those grounds alone many issuers
and investors might be somewhat reluctant to be first in the talf
mr fisher  so we cant say it has launched
ms mosser  well weve launched it in the sense that the subscription is open and
that lending has happened
mr fisher  all right
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  governor duke
ms duke  i just want to make sure my math is correct and my understanding is
correct  when we do the additional 500 billion in mortgagebacked securities does that
increase the pace at which we buy them or does it extend the time from june until the end of the
year
ms mosser  the 500 billion would largely extend the buying through the end of the
year  if the committee has a preference that those be frontloaded that would be possible for us
to do from an operational standpoint  as a matter of fact if the committee would be interested
in giving us direction on that wed be happy to take it  honestly the additional 500 billion
would not be a huge surprise to the market  i think the expectation of most is that 500 billion at
the same pace through the end of the year is a likely outcome of todays meeting
ms duke  under alternative a by my count its 500 billion in mbs 300 billion in
treasuries and 100 billion in agencies for a total of 900 billion  would we expect that to
have a similar result as in the note on 1 trillion in a combination of mortgagebacked securities
and treasuries  is that the result we would be looking for from alternative a
mr madigan  i think we consider it to be roughly the same  our ability to
discriminate between effects on one market or another is pretty limited  theres lots of
uncertainty around these estimates
ms duke  for alternative bwhich is 750 billion plus 100 billion i get
850 billion  would we also expect that to have similar impact  in other words would the fact
that theres no treasury component matter
mr reifschneider  given our ability to distinguish between them we wouldnt be
able to say that that made a material difference from any other one
ms duke  okay  thank you
chairman bernanke  there was a twohander from president rosengren
mr rosengren  yes just a clarification  it would seem that if the goal is to push
rates down and cause a wave of refinancing then wed want to be doing the bulk of the
purchasing during the period where the refinancing would occur which presumably would be
over the next quarter  if everybody refinances over the next quarter or two the ability to
purchase new mortgages in the second half of the year would probably be pretty limited if were
actually successful in doing it  it does seem that the goal is not to have an even flow over the
course of the year but to enable rates to get low enough that we facilitate a wave of refinancings
and new home purchases  so i think it would be good if we can provide some clarification that
the goal is not to spread it out but to push the rates down and get the refinancings going which
would imply frontloading assuming the program is successful
chairman bernanke  do you think the frontloading is more important than the
announcement effect
mr rosengren  i wouldnt want to be constrained to do only a limited amount and
have the refinancings cause rates not to go down very much
vice chairman dudley  you dont necessarily want to save the 500 billion for
the second half of the year is what youre saying
mr rosengren  right  if its appropriate id rather do it sooner than later  i want
to get as much bang for the buck in the next two quarters as we can
chairman bernanke  okay  can we find a phrase that would be added that
would say something like with the greater portion to be done in the first
vice chairman dudley  over the next several months
mr warsh  increasing the rate of purchases  i think thats what you are trying to
get the markets to gather
chairman bernanke  except its a little bit uncertain because if we frontload it
then later theres less  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  brian i just want to make sure i understand the numbers as well and it
comes down to a difference in wording between a and b  in b you have increase its purchases
of agency debt this year by 100 billion to a total of 200 billion  in a it just says boost its
purchases and now anticipates purchasing 200 billion  i guess that makes the headline
number in alternative a 1 trillion  but if i understand correctly its really an additional
900 billion of authorized purchases  is that right
mr madigan  thats correct
mr tarullo  okay  im just curious  why is the alternative a today 100 billion
less than the alternative a in the bluebook which was 500 billion additional mbs and
500 billion treasuries
chairman bernanke  could i interject something here for just a moment  as i
asked yesterday everyone gave their views and i listened very carefully to what the options
were  what was suggested here today was two approaches  one expanded on the mbs front
going from 1 trillion for this year to 1 trillion with a concomitant small increase in agency
debt but no treasuries  the other approach was to maintain the same pace of mbs purchases
through the second half of the yearsubject to a bit of language about timing in response to the
point that was raisedand to open a new front on the treasuries side there i was responding to
concerns that a number of people raised about monetization and the independence perception
and so on trying to make it seem more like a step into this arena rather than a bigscale new
intervention  so that was the thinking on those two approaches
let me now add having heard the discussion around the table today i think i would like
to raise a third option which is the union of the two which would be the 750 billion of mbs
plus the 300 billion of treasuries  id be open to that as well
im trying to avoid the proliferation of too many alternatives but what i heard today
suggests that some people at least might be interested in yet a more aggressive approach while
still attentive to the costs and benefits of expanding our balance sheet faster and further
do i have clarity on sort of what the options are now
mr tarullo  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  any other questions for brian  president lacker
mr lacker  my question is actually for ms mosser  if we adopted either b or the
schedule that the chairman suggested and you were to pace it the way you would what are the
chances that the monetary base will shrink in the next intermeeting period  youve got the taf
cpff amlf and foreign exchange swap lines  is there a significant chance that you wont
make enough purchases in the intermeeting period to offset other declines in our assets and leave
the monetary base shrunken rather than expanded over the period
ms mosser  if we accelerate particularly on the mortgage side and frontload those
i would view it as very unlikely  spence probably has a better feel on the liquidity programs  a
little shrinkage there might occur but particularly if we add treasuries and we are more
aggressive on the mortgage side i would view it as very unlikely that the base would shrink
vice chairman dudley  you have this one question of the settlement of
mortgage securities though which might not actually occur by then
mr hilton  you really have to look at what the settlement date is almost
ms mosser  yes thats right  in thinking about the base because the settlements are
so lumpy we probably have to switch a week forward and note that even though the base might
shrink one week it will jump up a lot the next when all of the mbs settle
mr lacker  do you think the base is likely to increase  would that be your
expectation
ms mosser  yes
mr lacker  a couple hundred billion would you guess
mr hilton  its not a long intermeeting period so a couple hundred billion might be
a little bit larger than is realistic  it is hard to anticipate where the liquidity facilities are going
but the fact that they have been relatively stable on balance for a couple of monthssince late
januarymakes me think that without some fundamental change in liquidity conditions theyre
probably not going to break in a substantial way one direction or another
vice chairman dudley  im sorry if i could just add a point  with the cpff
you had this big refinancing wave that happened late january  youre not going to have another
one until late april and theres going to be less coming due at that time so thats probably not
going to change dramatically  the big question is on the foreign exchange swap side  but that
has already come down a lot
mr lacker  the current size is around 400 or 500 billion
vice chairman dudley  450
ms mosser  i think i can say with some confidence that if we buy a lot of mortgages
by the middle of may its very unlikely that the monetary base will be shrinking and it will grow
fairly aggressively because the big settlements in mortgagebacked securities tend to happen in
the middle of the month
mr lacker  just to pursue this a little more whats sketched out here is 1 trillion
of increases in our assets above what they otherwise would be  if we were interested in assuring
that a certain portion of that passed through to the base that might call for even more offsetting
increases
let me ask something operational  if we wanted to be sure that the base expanded or
that it expanded by a certain amount could you vary treasury purchases within the intermeeting
period in a way that would react to incoming information on the foreign exchange swap usage
and the like to achieve that
ms mosser  yes  i think there might be better tools for doing that though  honestly
if that were the guidance given we would probably go back to doing repos
mr hilton  we can do repos  the other element is our involvement in the dollar roll
market as well which we probably could scale up at a relatively fast pace if we wanted to
again though we would have to look at the calendar because those also settle on a discrete
date
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  so president lacker just to reiterate the options quickly
the all mbs option would be 850 billionthats 750 billion plus 100 billion  what i will
call the treasury option is 900 billionthats 500 billion mbs plus 100 billion agency
debt plus 300 billion treasuries  the combined option is 115 trillionthats 750 billion
mbs 100 billion debt and 300 billion treasuries
my reaction to your question is that particularly if we frontload the mbs even though
there might be some weekly variation in the base the very strong trend of the base will be clearly
up for the rest of the year  this will certainly make it very clear to everybody that thats the
intention and that will be the result
mr lacker  well you understand my concern  there is 1 trillion on our balance
sheet that is demanddriven and could roll off in very uncertain circumstances  im not quite
sure whether that will happen or not  so you can understand why this leaves a fair amount of
uncertainty about where the base is going to be at the end of the year
chairman bernanke  it would all have to roll off  it certainly would be very
unlikely but okay  anyone else have a question for brian  no response
just in terms of parameters we have the three substantive options  i want to remind you
that there are also two statement options  one is more similar to what weve had before which
states the economic situation first and then goes through the paragraph on policy actions  we
also have proposed an alternative suggested by some comments that president bullard made that
in some ways would be analogous to our old structure in that it would put the policy actions first
for the sake of convenience lets call that the inverted structurewithout any derogation
implied  so let me now go to president plosser if youre ready
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i raised some issues yesterday about asset
purchases and policy  i think some of the things that remain questions for our policies going
forward include for example  how do we evaluate the merits of the various programs we have
what are the tradeoffs  which ones work best  which ones dont  how do we equate the
programs at the margin to get the most bang for the buck as we use our balance sheet
i think a lot of the discussion yesterday about treasuries versus mbs had a mixed tone to
it in the sense that part of it was a desire to use monetary expansion to support the economy at
large while some people wanted to use the asset purchases for liquidity purposes or to bring
mortgage rates down or to target credit market interventions in certain markets  certainly part
of the debate about whether to use treasuries or mbs depended on which side of that fence you
were on  so i think we still have some work to do about deciding the policy mix
but im going to throw a monkey wrench in the works  yesterday the chairman asked
for alternative ways of saying some of this  one of the issues we discussed and it came out i
think loud and clear was that theres a lot of concern about the path of policy  when we
announce policy actionswhether they be the talf mbs or what have youwe tend to
announce them as quantities  as a result its not very clear what happens when that quantity is
reached  what happens after that  what will be the next market  what will happen going
forward  i think theres an argument that conducting policy in that manner creates a lot of
uncertainty in the marketplace about whats going to come next  are they going to do it again
and if so how big would that be  another issue when we target specific volumes is that the
conditionality of those interventions doesnt come through very clearly  it may seem that we are
going to do the 500 billion no matter what else happens
so president bullard and iim going to implicate him as wellwondered well is
there another way to do this that might be helpful  we put together a new version of the
statement with the idea that we want to get beyond just announcing oneoff programs that we
may or may not do again and move toward thinking about saying that were going to have a plan
to increase the size of the balance sheet or increase the size of certain components of the balance
sheet over a period of time and that well adjust those growth rates if you will as needed as the
economy either worsens or improves
the proposed wording was passed aroundweve called it alternative b6   the idea
here was to address the question okay how else could we communicate to the markets about
what our plan is  paragraph 1 basically becomes the federal open market committee
decided today to continue to increase the federal reserve balance sheet through the purchase of
agency mbs and treasury securities  the committee expects the growth rate of the mbs and
treasury components of the balance sheet combined to average about 10 percent a month  the
committee will carefully monitor macroeconomic and financial conditions and adjust this rate of
expansion as warranted

6  the statement distributed by mr plosser is appended to this document appendix 6
now we came up with 10 percent a month  basically that would get us to the 1 trillion
over the course of the year which we were talking about yesterday  its ambiguous about
whether it ends up being treasuries or mbs  it then says we will carefully monitor this
expansion at each meeting and adjust it as we deem appropriateif we need to ramp it up we
can do that and if we want to bring it down we can bring it down  the rest of the statement is
pretty much the same as the original  we took the rest of what was paragraph 1 and made it
paragraph 2 which is basically a discussion of the talf and the other programs that weve
initiated  so it is the same there and the rest of the statement basically follows b  again our
view is that we were looking for a way to get us out of thinking about oneoff programs or
volumes of purchases that were going to make and instead we were trying to set a target or
objective for a growth rate of some set of quantities  i think there can be debate about whether it
should be treasuries plus mbs  i think president lacker would probably prefer it to be targeting
the base to get the same outcome
but we wanted to put this on a table as kind of a straw man to get the committee thinking
a little bit about different ways to help us manage expectations better  its also contingent on
economic conditions which we think is important
so mr chairman i know we surprised you with this but you asked us this question so
we thought wed try to come up with an alternative thats worth discussing
chairman bernanke  i appreciate it  thank you  its interesting and some may
view the lack of specificity between mbs and treasury as a plus and some might view it as a
minus  but its an interesting alternative so i appreciate your doing that  did you want to talk at
all about the choice of the substantive alternatives
mr plosser  i have a preference for treasuries in general as i discussed yesterday
my preference for treasuries is not particularly driven by a desire to push down longterm
interest rates so much as it is by a desire to help manage the composition of our balance sheet
im not as worried about the effect on inflation expectations of buying treasuries in part
because if there is a concern about expectations of inflation its that i really dont want them to
fall  so i am not too worried about that aspect of it and i do prefer treasuries  in terms of the
magnitudes im sympathetic to expanding but i dont have strong opinions about how much we
should expand
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  first to state the obvious  were at the zero
bound were resorting to extraordinary tools to offset the deflationary and other consequences of
overly tight monetary policy and we have to deploy that extraordinary tool kit effectively
deliberately and with clarity  president lockhart injected a little humor by congratulating you
on your having an interchange named after you and pointing out there is an offramp  there is
no offramp right now unfortunately  and president pianalto pointed to your 60 minutes
performance which i also wanted to applaud except to point out there was one weakness  you
were opposite george clooney in that time slot  laughter
i mention these things because im sympathetic to what president plosser mentioned in
that a there is no offramp and b we have to think way ahead  i talked two years ago about
decision trees  we at least have to think of where this highway is possibly going to take us  the
ad hocery of what we are doing is a bit of a concern to all of us at the table but lets
acknowledge the fact that we are in extraordinary circumstances and we have to play ball
according to whats on the field
i do have a preference as i stated yesterday to focus on where we have demonstrated
extraordinarily well our capacity to play which is in the mortgagebacked securities market  im
very sympathetic to president rosengrens argument particularly as to timing
although i dont have a vote in this matter in this cycle i would support alternative b  i
still have concerns about being viewed as monetizing deficits  i think theres a possibility that
the political classthat is the legislaturewill ask for still more  but its not clear to me
whether buying treasuries might be interpreted as our accommodating fiscal profligacy
although i understand the circumstances of the moment which are certainly trying  i think
governor tarullo offered a very sophisticated approach to this yesterday which is to do things in
proportion and i could live with the alternative that that has the lesser weighting on treasuries
i do think it is important to exercise our muscle in the mortgagebacked securities market  my
contacts tell me that when you get to the 4 percent level you do have some effectiveness and i
think thats clearly an area where we want to have extraordinary effectiveness
as to the statement itself mr chairman im not sure why were emphasizing the job
losses and all of the things that as i said in my note youre aware of even if you live on mars  i
do worry about that given the fact that we are the institution that everybodys looking toin
part because we did get out ahead of the rest of the world  were viewed as a precious institution
with i think superior credibility compared to all of the other institutions of government at
present  im not sure its helpful to keep pounding on the negative  the economy is contracting
and it continues to contract  we neednt say more  the important thing is that we say what
were going to do about it and we do so with clarity
let me add parenthetically that i appreciate your moving the fed funds decision down to
where it should be which i believe both of us asked for last timethat is moving it down in
terms of order of priority
i want to conclude with one last statement  my greatest concern is the talf  i think i
made that obvious  i would caution you to be very careful on this publicprivate partnership  i
made my living doing extraordinarily complex transactionstaking distressed companies
restructuring them and taking the equity outand i was confused yesterday by what was
described  but im more worried about the politics of it  i think we have to be very careful with
our precious franchise in dealing with an embattled opposite particularly on the administration
side so that we dont jeopardize our special standing in the community by appearing to
accommodate political necessity and exigency  i would urge you and this committee to stay
away from the legacy assets for now  and i would urge you to be very careful about any
commitment to the publicprivate partnership concept  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  pardon me  i missed one point i wanted to make in my comments
president fisher reminded me of it  in our b one of the things we changed was the description
of the economy which jim and i both agreed with president fisher sounded panicky  we
changed what i think was in paragraph 2 to take out a lot of the detailed description and wrote
the decision reflects the committees view that the economy is undergoing a severe
contraction which it is  and we said the nearterm outlook is weak  the other change in the
same spirit is in the rest of that sentence  the committee anticipates that market forces and
policy actions will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth  i think
in the original it says that policy actions alone will stabilize the world  and frankly i think
creating an impression that the only game in town is policy actions and that market economies
have no contribution to make in this stabilization is setting us up for failure and a credibility
problem so we added the reference to market forces  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  im going to talk a little more about this
b option  let me just follow up on some of president plossers and some of president fishers
comments  when we think about optimal policy under interest rate targeting which is what
were all used to we decide what were going to do and we communicate it  it has a path
because youve got a rule in mind about how youre going to operate policy in the future so that
gives you a projected path and that allows the private sector to coordinate on that path  thats
all part of how the equilibrium works and how the optimal policy works  what im concerned
about right now and in the last couple of meetings is that were not doing that  because we hit
the zero bound the interest rate targeting regime was taken off the table by events so were
ending up with these onetime announcements with round numbers and that makes the future
path of policy unclear  the private sector as i said yesterday will try to guess what the fomc
will do regardless of whether we say anything or not  for years and years we didnt say
anything  but we can do a lot better i think by reducing that uncertainty and by laying out some
kind of a pathheres what were thinkingand making it contingent of course on
macroeconomic events  so thats what we are trying to get at here
clearly the focus is on asset purchases around the table so this b certainly talks in
those terms  a problem that im concerned about is that precommitting to a particular number
without making it contingent on macroeconomic developments may not be wise  incoming data
may not match up with the commitment that you made  it would be the same thing under
interest rate targeting  you would say were going to go somewhere today theres a projected
path out there but of course its always dependent on incoming data
alternative b tries to address these issues and i might say its equally well called a
because its not really tied to particular amounts  in fact you might end up with a little more in
total here  its very aggressive lets put it that way
first the form of the statement  you say the main thrust of policy at the beginning of the
statement which is something id like to see us do and we certainly did that under the interest
rate targeting regimewe would say right away what we did with the fed funds rate  the fed
funds rate at zero is not news right now  even the fact that its going to stay at zero for a long
time is not news right now  so i just moved that part down in the statement  most of these
statements have that
there are three principles behind this b so let me just talk about them  first of all there
is the agency mbs plus treasuries as a group  second theres a growth rate feature to it so you
talk in terms of growth rates instead of specific numbers  and the third principle is that you
adjust in response to economic developments so you have this policy rule aspect
let me address all three of these  first the agency mbs plus treasuries  this is
certainly the type of largescale asset purchases that weve been talking about  it avoids mention
of balance sheet growth as a whole because youve got volatile aspects of the balance sheet that
are under what i would call liquidity provision  there youve got the taf in particular its
whoever shows up for the auctions youve got the swaps and youve got the commercial paper
facilities  thats now about 1 trillion as president lacker was pointing out  its kind of
volatile  its liquidityoriented  our own projections expect that to run off as financial
conditions improve  so this version just sets those programs aside and thinks about managing
them separately
the agency mbs plus treasuries as a group provides some flexibility  as trish has
pointed out mbs can be lumpy  youve got this refi wave coming in  so you could do more
mbs at certain points and you could do more treasuries later and you dont have to specify it
at the level of the committee  there are good arguments on all sides about the choice between
mbs or treasuries and demerits on both sides so i think maybe the thing to do is just mix them
together and provide some flexibility  also my own view on this is that theyre both backed by
the treasury effectively anyway so i dont see a lot of difference
now youve got this persistent component of the balance sheet which is the mbs plus
treasuries and thats going to grow at this 10 percent approximate rate  frankly its an
extremely rapid rate but thats what we want because were in a very sharp downturn here
then youve got these temporary components of a balance sheet which are going to run off
hopefully when the financial market turmoil abates  and its this underlying trend that you want
to get the markets to focus on as the chairman was saying a minute ago  so this is a plan for
expansion in the persistent components of the balance sheet and it helps coordinate private
sector expectations and reduce uncertainty about policy going forward  this has been a key
private sector concern as weve heard around the table  all of the contacts are saying to us
what are you guys doing  i dont understand the policy  there are all these announcements  i
cant figure it out  so maybe this is a simpler and more transparent approach without getting
into a lot of specifics about particular asset categories
the biggest thing for me and perhaps for president plosser is that youre not pre
committing  you can adjust as you go along  this is a plan but like an interest rate path it
would be contingent on macroeconomic developments and youre not stuck with a particular
number going forward  thats the third part  youd be able to adjust this in response to
economic developments  again were going to be at zero nominal interest rates for a long time
probably globally  i think its important to try to lead globally and give a signal to other central
banks about how they might implement their policies  this is a kind of a feedback rule
obviously we dont know what the rule is at this point and we dont know how much we will
react to incoming developments  thats something we have to learn over time  hopefully we
can figure that out as we go along  but this would get us going in that direction and provide a
credible replacement for our interest rate rules that were taken away from us by events
thats my case for the main part of it  ill talk just briefly about the other parts of the
statement  the description of the economy paragraph 3 is whittled down from the text in some
of the other statements  thats in response to president fishers comments  we can certainly
say that the economy is in bad shape but i dont think we have to say too much more than that
obviously because we put convenient numbers on here you can mix and match with your other
favorite descriptions of the economy
i agree completely that we should be very aggressive in this situation  but we need to be
aggressive in an organized way  also were taking unprecedented actions  you have to be
careful about going too far in a direction without a plan  we dont know what the effects really
will be our models really dont tell us too much about it  so this alternative holds out options
for adjustment as data arrive  hopefully it would provide better communication to the private
sector and hopefully youd get a more effective policy out of that  a lot of communication is
not just us talking but it is saying ive got a clear path for future policy
im very concerned about deflation near term  im concerned about a deflation trap in
which you go to this new steady state and get stuck there  but a mediumterm risk is that the
economy behaves sort of like normal and if a normal recovery takes hold then youve got a
possibly explosive inflationary situation  but thats down the road  you have to avoid the
deflation trap outcome first  maybe if we did get to that mediumterm stage this would set us up
to be able to react to that situation a little better
chairman bernanke  thank you again for constructive suggestions  i have a
couple of questions  i do want to point out we did try in alternative a to create a reaction
function element in the very last sentence where we say we will be assessing whether a faster
pace would be helpful  essentially the pace will be varying as conditions changeits hard to
be more specific than that  i guess i have one question for you and one for trish  for trish
maybe you can help me  what do you think would be the effect of not specifying the breakdown
between treasuries and mbs
ms mosser  wed immediately get the question  whats the breakdown between
treasuries and mbs  and what are you going to do about agencies  but the agency debt
market is the simple part to answer because thats a much smaller market  i think wed end up
having to give a hint or they would take away from our first two operations what your
preferences were whether that was correct or not
mr bullard  i took it from the discussion that people would like to frontload mbs
to the extent thats feasible  but this formulation would let you still have growth later on if you
want
chairman bernanke  i have a question for presidents plosser and bullard about
the flexibility you get by saying just per month without any specification of timeframe  i
imagine you would therefore have less of an announcement effect and it would be more
difficult to do a persuasive frontload in that case
mr bullard  i dont know why the announcement effect would be any different  it
adds up to the same amount
chairman bernanke  for example one thing you could sayim just trying to be
helpfulwould be a combined average of about 10 percent per month in the next few quarters
or something like that to give a bit of a horizon
mr bullard  yes sure
chairman bernanke  this also relies on people being able to do geometric
calculations  laughter  ill put that aside for now
mr plosser  well actually mr chairman we did debate whether or not there ought
to be horizon on it  but i think you could give a horizon if you wanted to as long as you kept
the conditionality that we will monitor this going forward and that its subject to economic and
financial conditions
mr lacker  i am not sure i understand one point about this  presidents bullard and
plosser propose a geometric path  but why not pick an endpoint and go linearly to that  that is
what we are doing with the mbs so far  doesnt that make more sense  we could still call that
10 percent per month
ms mosser  i would say in fact to president rosengrens point one might actually
want it to be frontloaded
mr plosser  i think we say an average of 10 percent a month
chairman bernanke  okay  lets go on if i might  president rosengren
mr rosengren  this was the most depressing goround in a year and a half and
this was a really bad year and a half so it highlights that were far away from where we want to
be both in inflation and in unemployment  and in terms of communicating with the public i
think thats what were communicating to the public  were not where we want to be and we
want to get there as quickly as we can
i dont think simple rules on the balance sheet or the monetary base are appropriate
these are different programs for different problems  if the interbank market is disrupted i
would expect swaps and taf to go up  if we have a real problem in other areas id want to do
significant asset purchases  these are not substitutes and just having either a balance sheet or a
monetary base rule is assuming that these programs are substitutes for each other  theyre
dealing with different problems
i think this is an opportune time to push down rates as significantly as we can  i think we
should be very aggressive  i think everybodys discussion around the table indicated we should
be aggressive  i like the idea of heavily weighting on mbs purchases i think that will be the
most effective  i also like the idea that if were going to try to get the most bang for the buck
given that these are experimental programs we ought to try at least to see what happens with the
treasuries as well  so my preference would be to do the combination of a and b which is the
115 trillion total to try to have as big an effect as possible  and i would try to frontload it so
we get as much impact in the spring as we can  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  obviously sentiment is pretty gloomy
around the table and theres a fair amount of consensus that we want to make monetary policy
more aggressively stimulative with our actions at this meeting and were grappling with how to
structure that shift  i think it makes sense to embark on a fairly aggressive asset purchase
program but i think we ought to admit that were fairly uncertain about how our actions are
going to go about affecting the economy  this isnt different in principle from four years ago
then we were unsure about how another quarter point one way or another was going to affect the
economy  but the magnitude of the uncertainty is quite significant here
weve talked around this table for a year and a half about different theories of how these
programs and our actions are affecting the economy  weve talked about credit market frictions
asymmetric information and other frictions that might inhibit certain markets ability to respond
adequately to disruptions  were not going to settle that debate here  weve also talked about
the effect of changes in the monetary base  banks appear to have absorbed a humongous amount
of reserve holdings without a readily discernible effect on a lot of other aspects of their behavior
it suggests banks are more or less indifferent between holding reserve balances and other assets
that function as very liquid reserves  and if so that rationalizes the view ive heard some
express that increasing the supply of bank reserves is generally going to be ineffective at the
margin  and there are some readings of historical episodes of very low interest rates that are
consistent with that as well
but this logic has its limits  commercial banks hold only about 13 trillion in treasury
and agency securities so if theres a flat spot in the demand curve by banks for bank reserves it
might not take that much more of an increase in our balance sheet to get past that flat spot  and
if we do that i think theres bound to be some effect there just has to be a finite upper limit on
this flat spot of the demand curve for reserves  and even before that id expect some rates of
return to have to change  i have a bank in my district that held 136 billion in reserves a couple
of days ago  surely the configuration of repo rates and the other instruments they operate in
must have an effect on their willingness to hold that much in reserves  its really hard to know
where that upper bound iswhere the end of the flat spot isbecause we dont have much data
to draw on but i think it must be there  so as i argued yesterday i think we need to recognize
some uncertainty about which theories are the right ones to rely on and how to think about what
we do
i take the credit easing weve doneprogram by program aimed market by marketas
arguing that more of those programs in more of those markets is more stimulative than fewer in
lower dollar amounts  i think that the logic of this focus on the monetary base also suggests that
more monetary base is more stimulative than less  so in the current setting i think trying to
ensure that we at least achieve a certain amount of growth in the base is consistent with both
views and worth pursuing  thats what has motivated my line of questioning for patricia
mosser and it motivates why id like to suggest that we put a clause in the directive at the end
of sentence four that says but should ensure that the monetary base expands by at least x
billion dollars during the intermeeting period  i dont think we should conduct policy by
slapping 47 constraints on the desk at every meeting but it strikes me as a small thing to ask in
order to be sure that the stimulus that might be withdrawn as some of these programs roll off is
offset as we go forward
i would favor the larger program that you outlined mr chairman with the 300 billion
the 750 billion and the 100 billion increases  i like the idea behind the suggestion of
presidents plosser and bullard about putting a commitment to a pattern of purchases in the
statement  but for the reasons i just outlined im not sure that gets us where we want to be  it
seems to me that if we did that and yet the balance sheet went down by the end of the year
because of a bunch of other stuff rolling off im not sure wed be persuaded that we had made
monetary policy more stimulative or eased credit  so id like to see us focus on the overall size
of our balance sheet and our programs and the base  that would provide as well with an
overarching framework a kind of coherence to what we do to convey the sense that were not
just responding market by market but that we have an overarching conception of how were
providing stimulus and how were going to get through this  and i share the view of presidents
fisher plosser and bullard that toning down the language would be useful  it has always been
the case that theres a mapping from words we use like somewhat adverse to peoples
interpretations which are much scarier than somewhat adverse  i think were stepping outside
that mapping when we go as far as we did in the statement as its drafted
chairman bernanke  first trish and spence would you folks think about a
sentence that could be added to one of the directives to the effect that the desk will strive to
ensure that the monetary base or the size of the portfolio or something like that has a
positive monthly growth rate or whatever you think would be realistic or manageable  we
dont want to put in something that just for operational reasons doesnt work
mr evans  ive been listening to this and im sympathetic to the different ways wed
like to try to characterize a path  i think its very difficult  ensure is a strong word  i had
been thinking about maybe something weaker like we would expect to see the base grow
which is sort of an indicator of how we think things are going but not the policy rule itself
chairman bernanke  it is the expectation of the committee that the base will be
growing over time or something like that  does that help
mr hilton  balance sheet or base
chairman bernanke  federal reserve liabilities  im just making this
assignment and theyll come up with a suggestion  well discuss it at the end okay
mr evans  perhaps with a clause conditional on stability in certain lending
facilities
chairman bernanke  well make some kind of attempt  its just a good faith
effort thats all
mr lacker  if i could suggest because of the possibility of sfp or fed bills you
might want to try both the base and the balance sheet rather than choose one
chairman bernanke  well well worry about sfp when we get it  laughter
let me address this issue about pessimism  i just want to point out that the january statement
was isomorphic to what were proposing to say in this one  its in your handout  its not exactly
the same but its very similar  the only difference is that the last sentence in january was that
the downside risks are significant and we leave that out of this one
mr fisher  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes president fisher
mr fisher  we did state it before  therefore why dont we just say continues to
contract or contract severely  again were hammering this point and i believe we are
beginning to be scary  just for a moment i want to go back to your 60 minutes show  i think
that was a positive  it was a lift and we engendered some confidence  here we are just pulling
the rug out again
chairman bernanke  okay  i hear the point
mr lacker  its the severe contraction phrase i think that gets attention
chairman bernanke  okay  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  lets see if i can hit some of the highlights
here  i certainly agree with everybody else that we need to be going in with everything we can
under the current circumstances  and the question is  what can we do and how can we explain
it
i favor your combined alternative a plus b  i think that qualifies within the limits of
what we can do as a good effort under the current circumstances  as we discussed yesterday
what we do know is that asset purchases seem to be the most effective thing we can do  weve
seen the mbs purchases be effective  i think its a good idea to use all of the tools and buying
treasuries is one of the tools so i think we ought to include treasuries  i think theres enough
evidence from the event studies that that will have a positive effect on financial conditions  im
not worried about the issues of monetizing the debt or inflation expectations given the size of
the output gap and given the fact that were working on exit frameworks at the same time and
weve strengthened our discussion of the longterm inflation objectives
in terms of shifting the emphasis to the base president lacker you talked about
uncertainty in linking our portfolio to the economy  i think that goes for the base as well  i
actually asked a senior official at the bank of england how he would explain how increasing the
base and increasing the money supply were supposed to affect the economy  i got kind of a
shrug of the shoulders and well weve run out of this other stuff so were going to talk about
this stuff now rather than a really coherent explanation of how the transmission channels run
from the base to the money supply to the economy  so i guess im not ready to put my marbles
entirely in that particular basket yet  in particular i cant quite link the shortrun fluctuations in
the basethe meetingtomeeting or weektoweek fluctuationsto what were trying to
accomplish  i think it depends a lot on why the base would go down  if it went down because
the whole demand for credit was going down and the economy was weakening then we ought to
be leaning against that and trying to increase the base  but if it went down because markets were
working better or because for example europeans had better access to dollar funding i dont
think thats something we necessarily have to lean against  i do think under the current
circumstances seeing a longterm upward trend in the base is useful and useful discipline on the
committee  but linking to a monthtomonth growth rate or meetingtomeeting fluctuations
within that longterm trendi dont think that will help market confidence i dont think thats
really going to be useful to us and i dont think it will be seen as putting a new framework that
everybody understands around monetary policy  broad money growth actually has been quite
strong in the united states  it was at 14 percent plus in the fourth quarter and 10 percent in the
first two months of the year so were not seeing that kind of tightness
i agree with president fisher that the talf is complex and difficult  this is a difficult
situation  i think were constrained as i said yesterday by various laws and regulations about
what we can do and whats politically possible in this situation  so its very uncomfortable but
im not sure we have any alternatives other than the asset purchases on the credit side of the
balance sheet  and i think we ought to just push ahead and make the best of a difficult situation
certainly doing something about legacy assets is very critical to the health of the banking
system  if we can contribute i think we ought to do so without jeopardizing our ability to carry
out monetary policy over the long term or taking credit risk on the balance sheet
on the various wording issues id prefer alternative a or a plus or whatever it would be
in your combined alternative mr chairman  as you can tell from my previous comments im
not sure that saying something about the growth in the base on a monthbymonth basis or the
growth in assets on a monthbymonth basis would actually reduce uncertainty  i think the
markets would kind of wonder what that was about  maybe we could prepare the way  maybe
we should do some research to look at how these things are linked together  but right now what
they expect us to do is talk about the amount were going to buy  i think the fact that were
leaning towards mbs is important  so id go with the wording of alternative a
my problem with a is that im imagining what it might be like if we didnt take any
additional actions at the next meeting  suppose at the next meeting we just decided to continue
with what were doing then i dont know what a would say  so im more comfortable with the
ordering of the paragraphs in a than i am with a  on the first paragraph i did think the end of
the first sentence the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the outlook for the
next several quarters has worsened could be read as suggesting we expect a sharp decline in the
economy for several quarters  so i certainly would cross that out  on the rest of it i wondered
as you did mr chairman about cutting back on all of the detail as compared with last time
whether people would notice that  im kind of indifferent and will go along with wherever the
committee wants to come out on that  i do think we need to say that were in a contraction the
nearterm outlook is weak and we expect things to stabilize later
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  if i can respond very briefly to governor kohn i agree with everything
you said about uncertainty about the mechanisms by which changes in the monetary base are
transmitted to economic conditions and about the difficulty of articulating how those
mechanisms would work  i wouldnt advocate putting all of our marbles in that policy
transmission mechanism  id just note that its a viable contender and we ought to act as if that
might be how were affecting the economy  hitting a target for monetary base growth plus or
minus isnt what i was advocating  i was just thinking about making sure its at least as
stimulative as we think it ought to be  i appreciate his comments  thank you
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you  as we talk about this statement i think its sadly ironic that
after weve doubled the size of our balance sheet were having a conversation about being
worried that it may shrink a little bit  its incredible to me that we would have that  and i agree
with what governor kohn said in that i dont think we should start talking 10 percent monthly
growth or whatever it is  were trying to deal with a broken intermediation and banking system
at the same time and i dont think we can turn it into a monetary policy instrument in terms of
how much we expect the balance sheet to grow at this point
with that i would say i am much more in favor of statement b as we had it  i would
admit that the banking system is broken  thats part of the reason were doing the talf  if
were going to expand and were going to address the broken intermediation process we should
focus on mortgagebackeds  thats what the idea was to begin with  lets stick with it  if we
now introduce treasuries into that 1 i think its only going to be confusing and 2 i think we
do have to look long term  our introducing purchases of longerterm securities farther along the
yield curve sets a precedent and i dont think its easy to back off from that once we get through
this mess were in right now  so thats why i prefer b
i also want to take just a minute and talk about the legacy talf  theres reference to
populist reaction to this and i actually think that this reaction is justified in important ways  we
ought to think about that because people are now confused between tarp and talf and i
think when we add the legacy talf its going to confuse things even more  the reason that
theyre reacting to it is tarp  i agree that it was necessary to keep from having a meltdown but
the execution of it was so confusing and so inequitable across the system that it created great
backlash  some of the backlash was very justifiedfor example when you have some banks
being told youre going to take it and a thousand other banks being told you can beg for
it and following that up with changing the rules youre not going to get anything but a
backlash  i think thats important to keep in mind
so as we think about going forward i come back to president fishers point about
needing a decision tree on how were going to deal with these legacy assets  our getting
involved in the legacy talf as ive heard it described to this point is i think very riskyvery
dangerous almostin terms of what the outcomes might be because there arent clear defined
decision trees indicating whos really going to be accountable for what  we need to get that
clarified before we have another reaction like the one we had recently
finally i do want to come back to something governor kohn mentioned yesterday in
reference to my comment about using excess reserves to help manage the balance sheet and set
the rate floor  i know that it got off to a rough start but i think we are getting our sea legs and
the industry is getting their sea legs  if we start issuing fed bills i think we are introducing
another tool that will start out with the best intentions but expectations will be raised how we
use it will be brought into account questions will arise about trying to get around debt ceilings
and so forth  i think we should try to avoid that if we can and see if we can use our interest on
excess reserves as a management tool  so with those comments ill again say id go with b
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  as i said i think were in the midst of a very
severe recessionits unlikely to end any time soon  the optimal policy simulations would take
the fed funds rate to negative 6 percent if it could and because it cant i think we have to do
everything we possibly can to use our other tools to compensate  with respect to what we should
do today my preference is for the combined alternative that would combine 750 billion of
mortgagebacked securities 100 billion of extra agency debt and the 300 billion of treasuries
i certainly support the mbs purchases  i think theyre likely to have a very positive
effect on the housing market particularly now and i certainly agree with president rosengrens
suggestion that we should frontload the purchases for the reasons he gave  i said yesterday that
i would also support purchases of treasuries  i think it would be useful to begin that now  i
favor diversification of what we do given the uncertainties about the impacts of any of these
programs  theres a principle elucidated by william brainard 30 years ago that when policy
actions have uncertain effects you should simultaneously use all of your instruments and i think
thats a worthwhile principle for us now
a couple of things on language  one of the differences between a and b concerns the
characterization of how long we plan to keep the fed funds rate low  a states for an extended
period while b uses the phrase for some time  the fed funds futures market at this point
seems to expect rate hikes next year  thats not our own expectation and to try to align market
expectations better with ours i would like to see the switch to an extended period as in a
with respect to a or athat issue of what goes firsti could certainly accept either  i was
positively inclined toward a on the principle that it makes senseand weve always done this
to state right away what the policy decisions are  now the focus is not on the fed funds rate so it
makes sense to state that weve decided to do suchandsuch with respect to programs but i
think that governor kohn has made an excellent point raising the question what will we do if
we dont have any action on a particular day  it may be difficult we dont want to keep
shifting from one thing to another if we cant envision how were going to write that on the day
we dont do anything new  i guess i would agree that its better to stick with the a formulation
with respect to alternative b that presidents bullard and plosser proposed i really
thought it was a very worthwhile and constructive idea  there are aspects of it that i liked and
that i thought were quite sensible such as suggesting some conditionality of what we might do
relating to economic and financial conditions and having some flexibility in the composition of
what we do  i thought that was very interesting and useful  but i would emphasize that i dont
agree with the underlying theory that says that there is a relationship between the size of the
monetary base and our impact on the economy and i would associate myself with the comments
of president rosengren and governor kohn on this  so i dont like the language that suggests an
emphasis on the size of our balance sheet and the size of the base  i think we have a real
theoretical disagreement among ourselves as to exactly how our policy works and i just
wouldnt endorse going in that direction
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  just to respond a little bit this doesnt say anything about the
monetary base  this says largescale asset purchase done in a certain way which i guess is
what our model has said  this is just a way to set the asset purchasesthats my intent
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  as i said yesterday i think that its important
that we do something big so your combined proposal is closer to that for sure and i definitely
think that we should diversify our actions  im a little concerned that were not going to have a
lot of good evidence on how effective these programs are for a few quarters  maybe well be
able to interpret something from how the yields move around but they also move around a lot
anyway  we like to take credit when they move in the right direction  and then other things
happen  i dont knowits very difficult  the delays are  it takes time to implement it takes
time to have an impact and it takes time to assess  so as president yellen indicated we dont
have enough confidence to bank on a single nontraditional channel i prefer doing more of these
i am a little sympathetic both to the discussion about the usefulness of indicating
something about the timing and to the way that presidents plosser and bullard characterized this
in terms of growth rates  what did seem to come out in the discussion that i at least was not
aware of was how we intend to play these purchases out  there are good market reasons for the
way theyre done and the markets understand that  so finding some way to provide that
information i think would be useful  i can see why the growth rate is attractive but indicating
frontloading or something about the time element seems to be important
we do have an awful lot of programs in place that are intended to be stimulative  theres
everything that weve done with the talf increasing and theres what the fdic has done with
the tlgp  i dont believe that weve seen anything in terms of the outlook for what the fdic
part of this new program with the treasury purchasing bad bank assets would be either but
presumably that would be stimulative as well  by the time we put all of this in place weve got
a lot that should be helping out  so the question i have is how to quantify what is enough  as
governor kohn mentioned we should be doing everything we can do so i think the combined
proposal is better  frankly i dont understand why we couldnt improve this to 500 billion in
treasuries too  were a little arbitrary it seems to me in terms of the total magnitude
i would like to be able to point to something like our bluebook analysisan analysis
where we think that this is as close as possible to our best modelbased thinking on what the
optimal policy response would be to reach the best we can achieve for the unemployment rate
recognizing that there are outcomes we cannot achieve  the reason for wanting something like
this is i would like it to be big enough now so that we can shift the hurdle for additional action at
the next meeting more toward the outlook has now deteriorated further and we need some type
of action  because at the next meeting were still going to have calls for whats next
whats next  we know how to think about responding in terms of the fed funds rate and where
the target is but the target for asset purchases is less clear so thats why my preference is for
more now so that we can shift that burden  id be willing to expand the treasury purchases to
500 billion but nobody else has indicated that
finally i think that we can spend an awful lot of time trying to get the wording exactly
right so that were all happy with it  i think its going to be incumbent upon all of us to make
some public comment  when we talk in public some of these issues will come up and i think
some of it will naturally be fleshed out if there are residual uncertainties  obviously when you
speak mr chairman you clarify things quite a bit but there might be some things for the rest of
us to say  thank you
chairman bernanke  the rationale for a slightly smaller purchase of treasuries is
that we dont know what the effect will be and its kind of a toe in the water thing
mr evans  i guess i didnt indicate that i do prefer alternative a the way its written
in terms of the next meeting the alternative a issue could be dealt with by saying something
like the committee decided not to change its policies or its programs
in order to shift the burden i would like to consider whether there is some language such
that with todays action we anticipate this better outcome in the last sentence  that would help
a little bit there but its just a suggestion
chairman bernanke  i am informed president fisher that you have to leave for a
plane  i am also informed that today is your 60th  birthday  is that correct
mr fisher  what a nice way to celebrate my birthday  laughter  with people i
greatly respect and i just want to say i hope i live to be as old as don kohn  laughter
chairman bernanke  we do have to move along here  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i think the case for increased asset
purchases is pretty compelling  its the sense of the committee and certainly i agree with that
so i have to think through a series of other decisions  the first one has to do with scale and my
thinking coming in was that the scale needed to be proportionate to the deterioration in the
outlook  speaking at least for myself and the atlanta analysis clearly there has been
deterioration since january but its within the range that i would have assumed at that time was
plausible  so im a little concerned about overreacting  when we first got the alternatives
alternative b was 500 billion and that of course was entirely in mortgagebacked securities
and agency notes  yesterday we learned that the talf is likely to roll out slowly  thats
information that i assume is not going to be understood by the public  it would probably
undermine the program if we said that we expected that  i had factored the talf into my sense
of proportional response  so i favor the alternatives that are below 1 trillion dollars  i dont
want to overstate this but i think we dont have good guideposts for how to size the action so i
think its reasonable to ask  will the public infer from our actions that we know something that
they dont and is this response of over 1 trillionwhich will probably get some headlines
really a signal that things are even worse than they actually are and in that sense could dig us a
little bit deeper
regarding timing  if we go with the mortgagebacked securities alternative i do favor
the views of president rosengren that theres a chance of accelerating that and making it have
high impact in the near term  i can support the treasury idea  but i actually think the central
question is the choice between treasuries and mortgagebacked securities  i can support
treasuries but my bias really is to favor the mortgagebacked securities option so that would be
one of the option bs  i like that for its certainty its impact on housing and its clarity in
communications  as i mentioned yesterday in my comments about communications certainly
what im hearing is that many of our constituencies would prefer simplicity and not a lot of new
programs so im leaning against the treasury purchases because it adds complicating factors
but if we are going to support the treasury purchases i endorse governor tarullos suggestion
that we explain why we did it very clearly  for example if we are doing it for liquidity reasons
then we should explain that if were doing it for the purpose of scaling up the balance sheet we
should explain that if we believe that there are spillover effects we should be explicit about that
in our rationale
regarding statement content i have some sympathy for the version offered by presidents
plosser and bullard but im not sure we can avoid quantities  i think the logical question that
the press is going to ask having been conditioned to hearing quantities is  how much does this
add up to  its very hard for us not to provide at least some estimate of that  conceivably there
is some way of crafting language that would address both the pace of purchases as well as the
ultimate quantity  i dont know how specific we have to be in the directive to make it a workable
directive  so id leave that up to the desk  im also okay with toning down severe
contractionthat was my original reaction when i read the alternatives a few days agoto
something thats not quite as stark as that  regarding statement structure i dont have a strong
feeling  i think we have two options  you either have a structure that builds up to the action
which has been our traditional approach or the action followed by the rationale  i have a slight
preference for building up to the action based on governor kohns comment namely what
happens if we dont in fact have an action  we certainly want to be consistent going forward
as much as we can on how these things are put together  so given all of that where i come out
is in support of alternative b but when it comes down to the vote i will support a a or a plus
or b laughter or b  yes ill end with a reference to charlie brown  you know sometimes
im wishywashy and sometimes im not  my definitive support is for alternative b  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lockhart on the issue of explaining the treasury
purchases in alternative a if we do the combination wed want to import the sentence from
alternative a that starts with moreover to help improve conditions in private credit markets
the committee decided  so that follows up the previous language and explains that were not
monetizing the debt and so on  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  it is clear to me from our discussion of the
outlook that more action is needed but as i said earlier i also think we need to focus on the
clarity of our communications in order to build public confidence  looking over the options that
were presented today i do prefer alternative b  i am clearly in favor of aggressive action and as
i noted yesterday i am open to the purchase of longerterm treasuries but as president lockhart
just mentioned in the interest of effective communications i think we need to better explain why
we decided to engage in the purchase of treasury securities at this time  brian gave us four
reasons why we might want to consider that and as you know mr chairman in our statement in
january we did say that we would do that in order to improve conditions in private credit
markets but i still think that may be a little too vague
while the staff comments yesterday indicated a little less certainty that we get a larger
bang for the buck if we purchase mbs versus treasuries i think we do have evidence that
purchases of mbs have generated significant interest rate reductions just through their
announcement effects  also the staff simulations highlighted yesterday the economic
importance of stabilizing housing prices and the effects on household wealth  so with the larger
purchase of mbs along with some of the treasury initiatives working in tandem i think
alternative b is a preferred way to go
in terms of the statement language the option of b or b i slightly favor putting our
actions in the front line or the first paragraph  there is some premium i think on clear and
easily verifiable actions in these difficult and confusing times although after listening to
governor kohns comments about what do we do when we dont take actions i see that that
might be a little confusing  but overall b is my preference at this meeting
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well it seems like almost everything is fair
game  so let me just make a few comments  i expressed my reservations about legacy talf
yesterday so i wont reiterate those  i hope i was clear  with regard to purchasing assets i do
favor including purchases of treasuries  i did back in december i think when we first talked
about it  i continue to  so i would certainly go down that path
that leads me to alternative a and the language and im willing to go with the larger
quantity that you proposed  all of the quantities are around 1 trillionquite honestly im not
sure were going to get a big difference in terms of market or macroeconomic effects at the end
of the day but i can certainly go with that  i would start with the language in alternative a  just
a couple of comments about that  i think i would be in favor of abbreviating the litany of the
economic conditions  i dont know that it adds all that much at this point  if we say severe
contraction i think that gets the message across  with regard to a versus a you could
probably take care of governor kohns concern at the next meeting by just saying if we didnt
do anything new that the committee reiterated its intention and i think that would probably take
care of it  but i dont see any great advantage quite honestly to reworking it at least at this
point  so i have a mild preference for a as written
having said that i do think the plosserbullard approach has merit if we can get over
some of these questions that have arisen such as what will people in the market make of it
and will people still want quantities and is there a way of integrating that approach with
some quantities if that would help clarify things  i think those are all worth serious
consideration  i dont have the answers today so im not proposing that we adopt that  but i do
think that perhaps there are at least the beginnings of a framework there that we ought to be
thinking about at future meetings and that may serve to help our communication and help people
in the markets understand better than they do right now where we intend to go  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  just a few points first  given the policy
uncertainty that weve all described that is out there in the world it strikes me our preferences
here in this room should be putting a greater emphasis on things that are clear and purposeful
versus those that are big and bold and more  clear purposeful big bold and moreif you
could pull it all together in one fell swoop that would be fine but absent that i would put the
preference on clear and purposeful
weve talked a lot about the makeup of our balance sheet  i would just reiterate a truism
which i think still has meritour biggest asset here is our credibility which is a function of a lot
of things including clarity success and trying to speak as much as we practicably can with one
voice and that will obviously govern my vote in support of the consensus emerging from this
discussion
having said that i continue to have a strong preference for avoiding treasuries for
reasons i described yesterday and given that since december markets seem to see us as
alternately having some affection and disaffection for purchasing treasuries for reasons that
have been hard to understand  i think we need to be prepared to address that issue if as i expect
we include treasury purchases in our statement today
in terms of the size of these various elements i think the only thing worse than buying
treasuries is to buy them in such a tepid way that we dont have any effect  i think if were in
were in  were crossing the rubicon  and i take very little comfort from the idea that we
would be somehow testing this out just a bit  so i think in effect what were really all saying
mr chairman is we are balancesheetconstrained  there is only so much of these new assets
whether they be mortgagebacked or treasuries that we are comfortable with given the risks to
our flexibility  so i am troubled that the 300 billion will be perceived to be relatively light  but
given peoples preferences around here i wont spend more time on that
in terms of some of the language i concur with the emerging consensus that we should
delete some of the carnage in describing the economy on the grounds that it is well understood
ive got next to nothing to offer on style between prime and nonprime
and on the plosserbullard proposals i think that its a pretty interesting framework  i
dont think its ready for prime time so id associate myself with what president stern said that
it would be a useful way in which we could start to think in anticipation of our next meeting
but i dont think at this moment we can easily capture that in a way which goes back to first
principles of being clear and precise  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i am actually in favor of the largest amount that
we can all agree on  my objective as i stated yesterday is to have the biggest effect on housing
that we possibly can  in terms of how we explain that i do like the prime version because it
puts the action first  having spent more of my time reading the statements than issuing them it
seems to me the first paragraph was always the action paragraph  and i think for a good time to
come this will be our action  in addition i think the easier we can make this to report the better
off we are  if you get reporters particularly third and fourthlevel reporters on a deadline and
all they read is the first part and skim through the rest they may not necessarily pick up the size
of this action  so i have a pretty strong preference for the prime version  also while i find it
interesting to put it on a percentgrowth basis weve already started down the path with the
dollar amounts and i think continuing with the way weve been communicating it already has
some certainty and some simplicity  to me it feels like announcing a stock repurchase in the
private sector  in that case you size your stock repurchase in relation to the amount of
outstanding shares that you have and its perceived that way and tends to impact your price that
way
finally on measuring effectiveness i think the questions at this point would be  how
big an effect does it have immediately on housing on the stock market and on things that create
wealth and how quickly do we see whether or not it has spillover effects
the last piece is this sentence that says we will be assessing whether a faster pace of
asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions  i originally liked that
because it implied that we were willing to do even more  on thinking about it though theres
something to be said for creating a little bit of fear in the housing markets that this is a window
of opportunity to refinance or purchase  so if it doesnt look like rates may go down further if
you wait then i think thats got some real value  so i suppose ultimately i come down in favor
of a plus  laughter
chairman bernanke  i must find new nomenclature im afraid  governor
tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  of the options on the table right now i
favor the combined option  like governor duke i would have been receptive to a higher
number and i guess president evans would have been as well  the reason for that is twofold
1 just because of my understanding of the magnitude of the challenge right now and 2 as
president evans said i think its really very important for us to be able to project a strong but
adaptable approach to monetary policy not just until the next meeting but over the course of the
next year  it seems to me that by rolling out a bigger more ambitious headline number if you
will but then saying were going to implement that over an extended period of time it gives us
the opportunity at each of the next several open market committee meetings to say we are
staying with an aggressive policy  in contrast to when youre working with the fed funds rate
and you either have to stay where you are or reduce it another 25 or 50 basis points here one
could say that the desk is continuing in an aggressive fashion to make purchases
that leads into the issue of communication more generally and like president lockhart i
think the maximum amount of explanation of what were doing and why were doing it is
important  there is and has been over the last several days a near obsession among markets
about whether or not we are going to engage in largescale purchases of treasuries  i will
predict that theres going to be a lot of speculation about why were doing it  i will also predict
that the explanation that its helping improve conditions in private credit markets will not seem
to most commentators to be a complete explanation  thus in an effort to respond to governor
warshs concernswhich i dont share to the extent of being unwilling to do securities
purchases but do think are importanti would hope that in the delicate but important arena of
communications outside of the formal statement we will be able to find a way quite quickly to
clarify why were doing this
chairman bernanke  i think one argument thats been made here is that we want
to diversify in different markets
mr tarullo  right exactly
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  obviously theres a need for
more stimulus and it looks like less support is going to be coming from other quarters so a
substantial escalation is appropriate  obviously given what i said yesterday i favor doing both
i would favor scaling up the treasuries size to 500 billion from 300 billion per governor
warshs comment that if youre going to do this you might as well do it in size  i dont think
the balance sheet constraint here is really meaningful because we can sell or repo the treasuries
at a future date  so i just dont think thats a reason to make the distinction between 300 billion
and 500 billion and i think well have a more definitive test of how the market perceives this if
we do 500 billion rather than 300 billion  at 300 billion if we dont get much response
were not going to know if it was because the market thought the scale was small  i think 500
billion is a more appropriate metric  i favor a over a just because i think its simpler and its
more consistent with what weve been doing  and i agree that we should not be quite so scary in
reminding people of how badly the economy is doing
chairman bernanke  thank you  lets try to put this all together  most
importantly i think theres a pretty strong consensus for the combined package the total of
115 trillion  i heard the point about doing even more in treasuries  i guess i think that just
crossing the rubicon will have a significant announcement effect because it will signal our
willingness to do more if necessary in the future  i am a little concerned about misinterpretation
of what were doing so i guess i would like to propose to stay where we are for the moment
we can always change it
i very much appreciate the contribution from presidents plosser and bullard  i dont
think were quite ready to go there but i do think we can start communicating in that way and
start trying to talk about percentages as we talk in speeches and other contexts  i think in
particular since we want to frontload its hard to put it in percentage terms at the moment  and
i think that to get the maximum effect in the short run that governor duke talked about it would
be better to have a headline number  but i think its actually a very constructive point and we
should think about ways to move in that direction if we can
so what i propose is to start from alternative b  i think its reasonable to do either b or
b but i didnt hear a huge amount of demand to go to b  i heard the concerns about the first
paragraph  what if we say that the economy continues to contract as some suggested
information received since the federal open market committee met in january indicates the
economy continues to contract period and wed drop the outlook has worsened as well
then if you like we could drop say the sentence that starts with weaker sales prospects but
i think that is consistent with our previous style in trying to describe elements of the economy
then i would note that we have a somewhat optimistic ending in this paragraph  so i dont think
that its going to be a huge shocker to anybody and we do have to motivate why were taking
such a strong action  comments
mr plosser  just a quick remark  i had suggested this notion of putting in market
forces in terms of returning to stability  i didnt know whether you had forgotten that but
nobody ever commented on it
chairman bernanke  no  i was trying to keep life as simple as i can but lets see
here  where is it
mr plosser  the committee anticipates that market forces and policy actions will
contribute to 
chairman bernanke  are people okay with substituting that sentence
mr tarullo  to what market forces are you referring
mr kohn  i think what i heard around the table mr chairman was not much
confidence that market forces are moving in that direction and might even be moving in the other
direction
mr plosser  theres not much confidence that government forces are going to fix it
either  so im not sure
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  surely if the economy recovers its going to be a combination of policy
actions and market forces  surely thats the case
chairman bernanke  well all were saying here is that these things will
contribute  were not saying that theyre the only reason
let me go on  president bullard
mr bullard  i just want to press on that a bit  it gives the impression that were
hanging on a thread as to what the congress does or what we do or something like that  i dont
think you want to leave that impression  despite what the government does you might recover
faster or you might recover slower and i think you should leave that thought in the minds of
private citizens
chairman bernanke  again i think what were saying here is that we anticipate
that these things will contribute to an overall dynamic
in b in the third paragraph we have the sentence about the additional 750 billion of
agency mortgagebacked securities bringing its total purchases of these securities to 125
trillion this year and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by 100 billion to a total
of 200 billion  so thats exactly as in b  can we say something like the desk has been
instructed to
mr madigan  i have a possible sentence mr chairman  the timing of these
purchases will be determined in part by conditions in primary and secondary mortgage
markets
chairman bernanke  i dont think thats what people wanted to say though
vice chairman dudley  i think its fine for the desk just to accelerate its
purchases and the market is going to see it
chairman bernanke  is it okay to do it that way and not put it in the statement
ms mosser  thats all right  i had something very similar to brians  i actually stole
the last sentence from alternative a
mr madigan  part of the issue mr chairman is that we dont know exactly when
the bulge in issuance is going to happen
chairman bernanke  okay  ill come to that one  thank you  lets back up a
second  there is the question of federal funds rate for some time  president yellen suggested
going to for an extended period
vice chairman dudley  i think thats more accurate
chairman bernanke  are we okay with that
mr plosser  can somebody explain to me how i am supposed to interpret that
change
chairman bernanke  because conditions have worsened our expected liftoff
time is probably longer than it was
then we have the sentence on the agency debtthats okay  then the next sentence
about prepared to purchase longterm treasuries is to be replaced by the sentence in alternative
a  moreover to help improve conditions in private credit markets the committee decided to
purchase 300 billion of longerterm treasury securities over the next six months
vice chairman dudley  are we putting up tos in front of all of these
numbers
chairman bernanke  yes  do we have up tos in the original announcements
mr madigan  yes i believe so
vice chairman dudley  i think they are always up to
chairman bernanke  all right  so lets make sure we have consistency with that
as governor duke and some others noted there were questions about the last part  we should
end the last sentence the committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and
composition of the federal reserves balance sheet in light of evolving financial market
developments period  why dont we say in light of evolving financial and economic
developments instead
mr plosser  you just added economic
chairman bernanke  but im dropping all the stuff about assessing our lending
programs  at this point were in an assessment mode  i think the only question remaining
brian is the up to
mr madigan  i think that may be actually difficult to work in here quickly in some
cases just as a grammatical issue
vice chairman dudley  i think the one issue though is to make sure its not
quite so definitive that you are committing to purchase exactly that number
chairman bernanke  why dont we put up to in front of each  so its up to
an additional 750 billion
mr kohn  agency debt this year by up to 100 billion
chairman bernanke  and then on treasuries purchase up to 300 billion
brian are you ready to try to read
mr madigan  i can try  laughter  from the top information received since the
federal open market committee met in january indicates that the economy continues to
contract
chairman bernanke  the rest is the same and the second paragraph is the same
mr madigan  so the third paragraph  in these circumstances the federal reserve
will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability  the
committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent and
anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal
funds rate for an extended period  to provide greater support to mortgage lending and the
housing markets the committee decided today to increase the size of the federal reserves
balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional 750 billion of agency mortgagebacked
securities bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to 125 trillion this year and to
increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to 100 billion to a total of up to 200
billion  moreover to help improve conditions in private credit markets the committee decided
to purchase up to 300 billion of longerterm treasury securities over the next six months  then
there is the talf sentence  then the committee will continue to monitor carefully the size
and composition of the federal reserves balance sheet in light of evolving financial and
economic developments
chairman bernanke  okay  were ready then  president lacker
mr lacker  the directive
chairman bernanke  the directive youre right  do we have something trish
ms mosser  about either the pace of purchases or the size of the balance sheet
chairman bernanke  the directive is to be made consistent and we said
something along the lines that
vice chairman dudley  we have to put the treasury sentence in the directive
mr lacker  can we use directive a
chairman bernanke  we dont issue the directive at 215 do we
ms danker  but we vote on it
chairman bernanke  well put in the treasury part  then can you include a
sentence like the desk will endeavor to ensure that the size of the portfolio rose
ms mosser  yes  we could say the committee anticipates that the combination of
outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of the federal
reserves balance sheet to expand in the coming months  were a little hesitant to pick the next
intermeeting period because of the lumpiness of mortgages honestly  but if that would suffice
we think that would work best from our perspective
chairman bernanke  expand significantly even
mr lacker  that works
chairman bernanke  is that okay
mr lacker  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  are we ready for a vote now  debbie would you
call the roll please
ms danker
chairman bernanke              yes vice chairman dudley        yes governor duke                     yes
president evans                    yes
governor kohn                    yes
president lacker                   yes
president lockhart               yes
governor tarullo                  yes
governor warsh                   yes
president yellen                   yes
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  the next meeting is april 28 and
29  well adjourn  lunch will be available and over lunch laricke blanchard will provide us
with an update on congressional activities  thank you
end of meeting
