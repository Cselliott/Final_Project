certainly ahead of me  so congratulations and welcome
mr evans  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  id also like to thank cathy minehan in absentia laughter for
being willing to postpone her celebratory lunch until the next meeting but we will do that in
october  the first item of business is to select associate economists  with brian madigan
becoming the secretary and mr evans taking on a new role we need to appoint two associate
economists  jim clouse from the board and dan sullivan from chicago have been nominated  do
i have a motion
speaker  moved
chairman bernanke  moved  discussion  thank you  all right  lets turn now to
the desk operations  bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the handout that you have in front of you  in my mind there are three key questions  first how did the problems in the subprime mortgage areawith losses that probably will ultimately turn out to be in a range of 100 billion to 200 billionlead to such broad market distress  second what is the cause of the dysfunction in us and european money markets  third how far along are we in terms of the adjustment processin other words when might we anticipate a resumption of normal market function
turning to the first question the losses in subprime mortgages had wideranging effects because the poor investment performance made investors much less willing to invest in structuredfinance products more generally  investors lost confidence because highly rated securities that referenced subprime assets performed poorly and because investors found it difficult to value complex structuredfinance products
this loss of confidence triggered several broader developments  the inability of mortgage originators to securitize nonconforming mortgage loans the rapid

1  materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
contraction of the assetbacked commercial paper abcp market the virtual shutdown of the collateralized debt obligation cdo and collateralized loan obligation clo markets the sharp shifts we saw into and out of treasuryonly versus prime money market mutual funds which in turn disrupted the treasury bill market and the anticipated pressure on bank balance sheets and the upward pressure on term funding rates
the pressure on bank balance sheets is coming from three major sources  first investor demand for securitized nonagency mortgagebacked securities has dried up bank originators now have to hold such loans in their bank portfolios  second bank backstop liquidity facilities have been triggered as investor appetite for assetbacked commercial paper has fallen sharply  third banks are expected to have difficulty syndicating the bridge loans that they provided to finance leveraged buyouts
of these three sources of pressure the rollup of abcp programs has been in my view the most important  the magnitude of the potential funding requirement is the largest and how much will come back onto bank balance sheets is very uncertain
the constraint on mortgage loan origination can be seen most visibly in the widening of the spread between fixedrate prime jumbo mortgage loan rates and conforming mortgage loan rates  as you can see in exhibit 1 the spread has widened from around 25 basis points to around 100 basis points in recent weeks  the sharp contraction in the abcp market began when commercial paper investors became aware that their investments could be vulnerable to loss but were uncertain as to the extent of their exposure in particular programs  this fear of loss had a legitimate basis for those abcp programs that finance mortgagerelated assets without full bank credit enhancement  an inability to roll over these programs in the current market would force the liquidation of the assets  in the current market that could lead to investor losses  the problem started in extendable commercial paper market programs where the credit enhancement backstop by banks was typically either absent or less than
100 percent  the problem then quickly migrated to structuredinvestment vehicle siv programs which suffered from similar shortcomings  from there the problem spread as riskaverse investors started to shun the entire asset class  assetbacked commercial paper rates rose for those programs that were able to roll over their outstanding commercial paper  this is shown in exhibit 2 which compares  unsecured and secured commercial paper rates  the volume of outstanding asset backed commercial paper shrank sharply as some issuers were unable to roll over their maturing paper  exhibit 3 illustrates the downtrend in the volume of outstanding abcp  exhibit 4 shows the maturity structure of outstanding assetbacked commercial paper and highlights the high proportion of paper that is now being rolled on an overnight basis  the pressure on the assetbacked commercial paper market was temporarily exacerbated by the behavior of money market mutual fund investors who shifted funds last month from prime money market funds to treasuryonly money market funds see exhibit 5  because the total assets in money market mutual funds are nearly four times the size of outstanding treasury bills these flows led to a large albeit mostly transitory fall in treasury bill yields  that is shown in exhibit 6

the good news is that the money flows into the prime money mutual funds have stabilized  this reflects greater discernment among investors about the risks associated with different types of assetbacked commercial paper and the widening yield differentials between prime and treasuryonly money market funds  it is noteworthy that those areas of the assetbacked commercial paper market with underlying structural problemsprimarily the extendable siv and sivlite portions of the marketrepresent only a small proportion of total assetbacked commercial paper outstanding  for example as shown in exhibit 7 siv programs represented only about 7 percent of the assetbacked commercial paper market before the recent sharp contraction  moreover as shown in exhibit 8 much of the assetbacked commercial paper market does not finance residential mortgage assetbacked securities so there is less uncertainty about the underlying value of the assets  also much of the market has solid credit support with 100 percent bank credit enhancement  this suggests that as time passes investors will gradually be able to distinguish between the different types of the abcp programs and stability will return to the multiseller banksponsored programs  already the pace of contraction of the overall abcp market has slowed significantly  however the extendable and siv programs are likely to continue to be under pressure
the third source of balance sheet pressure stems from the sharp contraction in cdo and clo issuance  as can be seen in exhibit 9 cdo and clo issuance volumes have plummeted in recent months  the virtual closure of the cdo market has led in turn to a virtual cessation of highyield debt issuanceillustrated in exhibit 10  these developments have created uncertainty for commercial and investment banks about their ability to syndicate the large volume of loan and debt commitments that they have made to finance private equity buyouts  these institutions are faced with the prospect that they may have to carry such loans on their books for an extended period at a discount to par value  syndication will be more difficult because the ability to transform a large proportion of these obligations into marketable investmentgrade products through the alchemy of structured finance is not currently an available option
this pressure on bank balance sheetsboth existing and anticipatedhas led to significant dysfunction in financial markets  in particular primary dealers have pulled back in their willingness to finance the security positions of investment banks hedge funds and other leveraged investors  exhibit 11 illustrates the median repurchaserate bidasked spread by primary dealers for three types of collateral gse mbs prime mbs and highyield corporate debtat overnight oneweek and onemonth maturities  as can be seen there has been an upward trend in bidasked spreads especially at the onemonth maturity   exhibit 12 illustrates the median haircuts applied against such collateral  again there has been an increase which has been particularly pronounced at the onemonth maturity
at the same time this balance sheet pressure and worries about counterparty risk have led to a significant rise in term borrowing rates  banks that are sellers of funds have shifted to the overnight market to preserve their liquidity and this shift has
starved the term market of funds pushing those rates higher  as shown in exhibit 13 the spread between the onemonth libor and the onemonth interest rate swap rate has widened sharply and the onemonth libor has generally traded considerably above the anticipated level of the overnight federal funds rate  the same pressure on funding rates has been also evident in euribor rates see exhibit 14  the rise in term rates has pushed banks that depend on funding from the interbank market into the overnight market  in addition these depository institutions have turned to the federal home loan bank system as a source of term funding  for example fhlb advances rose 110 billion in august  in contrast despite the 50 basis point reduction in the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate target the dollar value of discount window borrowings remains modest as shown in exhibit 15  this reflects the lower cost of fhlb advances the ability to borrow at longer terms from the fhlb and the lack of stigma in using such advances as a source of funding
so where do we go from here  clearly the adjustment process is far from over
assetbacked commercial paper programs are still being rolled up and there is considerable uncertainty about how difficult it will be to roll some of this paper over quarterend  moreover it remains unclear what proportion of leveraged loan commitments commercial and investment banks will be able to syndicate and at what price  despite the big backlog and the end of the august doldrums there has as yet been little syndication activity  the good news of course is that as time passes the uncertainty about bank balance sheet pressures and funding requirements should lessen  moreover investors ability to distinguish between good and bad abcp programs and structuredfinance products should continue to improve  the bad news is that the stress caused by the forcible deleveraging of the nonbank financial sector could lead to further losses accompanied by headlines that could further damage investor confidence  moreover the increased reliance by banks on overnight funding increases rollover risk and may limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance sheets to accommodate the deleveraging of the nonbank financial sector  in the mortgage sector depository institutions will undoubtedlyat the right pricetake up the slack in the prime jumbo mortgage market  but nondepository institutions are unlikely to be able to originate and securitize nonconforming mortgages in appreciable volume for some time
the tone in financial markets has improved a bit in recent days  nevertheless we still appear to be in an environment in which the dominant theme is risk aversion
this can be seen in a matrix that measures the correlation among the price movements in the major asset classes see exhibit 16  in times when markets are calm and untroubled the correlation coefficients are generally low  as you can see in the exhibit which examines these correlations since the august 7 fomc meeting the correlation coefficients have been very high recently
in the foreign exchange markets two developments are worth noting  first the turmoil in money markets did impair the functioning of the foreign exchange swap market  this made it more difficult for banks in europe that are structurally short of dollars to obtain the dollar funding needed to fund their assets  in recent days this
market function has improved  second the dollar has weakened  as shown in exhibit 17 the dollar has fallen to a record low against the euro  but dont be too impressed by that headline  on a broad tradeweighted basis the decline of the dollar has been modest with a decline of less than 1 percent from the last fomc meeting and a fall of slightly more than 4 percent from the start of the year  moreover this softness in the dollar does not appear to signal any fundamental shift in the willingness of foreign investors to hold dollardenominated assets  instead it appears to be driven mainly by changing interest rate expectations  as shown in exhibit 18 the exchange rate of the dollar versus the euro has continued to track changes in expected shortterm interest rate differentials between the united states and europe
not surprisingly our dealer survey reveals a large decline in shortterm rate expectations  exhibits 19 and 20 compare the dealer surveys before the august 7 fomc meeting and before the current fomc meeting  the green circles represent the average of the dealer forecasts and the blue circles represent the range sized by the number of dealers at each value  as can be seen the average of the dealer modal forecasts for mid2008 has fallen more than 60 basis points  market expectationsas reflected by the solid bold lineshave declined about the same amount and remain below the average dealer modal forecasts  with respect to the outcome of this meeting a slight majority of dealers expect a 25 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate rather than a 50 basis point cut  only one dealer expects no change in the federal funds rate target  uncertainty about the shortterm interest rate path has also increased  this is evident both in the dealer survey and in the probability distribution of rate outcomes implied by options prices on eurodollar futures  as can be seen in exhibit 21 the probability distribution of rate outcomes has become much broader since the august 7 fomc meeting
finally open market operations since the last fomc meeting warrant some discussion  as you know in early august following persistent upward pressure on the federal funds rate and an extraordinarily large reserveadding provision by the ecb we aggressively added reserves on august 10  that provision of reserves did break the upward pressure on the federal funds rate and the federal funds rate traded notably soft over the remainder of that twoweek reserve maintenance period  since that time we have attempted to pull back on our provision of reserves in order to push the federal funds rate back up toward its target  notice that the blue bars in exhibit 22 which measure daily excess reserves before borrowing have been generally in negative territory over the past month  although we have had some success in pushing the effective federal funds rate higher it has generally traded over the past month below the 5 percent target
our efforts to push the federal funds rate back toward the target have been undermined by several factors  first expectations about the possibility of an intermeeting cut in the federal funds rate target have caused the federal funds rate to trade somewhat soft  also in recent days the effective rate has been held down somewhat by expectations of a rate cut at todays meeting  second the narrower margin between the discount rate and the federal funds rate target makes it more
difficult to push up the effective federal funds rate  the upper band of the corridor above 5 percent is now half as wide as before even as the lower bound for the federal funds rate remains at 0 percent  the lower discount rate acts as a cap on how high the federal funds rate can climb when reserves are tight  third we have had bad luck in the sense that most of our forecasting misses in terms of autonomous factors that affect reservessuch as float treasury balances currency demand and borrowings at the windowhave caused us to inadvertently leave more reserves in the banking system than we had intended  our difficulty in pushing up the effective rate can be illustrated by our experience last wednesday the last day of the twoweek reserve maintenance period  despite a consistently stingy provision of reserves that resulted in 5 billion of overnight primary credit borrowing for the day and 72 billion in total borrowing the effective rate for that wednesday was 518 percent  i would note though that in the past two days we have actually pushed the funds rate effectively up to its target
there were no foreign exchange operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the august 7 fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  are there any questions for bill  president plosser
mr plosser  i appreciate your comments on this last point but i think that the fact that
the fed funds rate has been trading so low for so long is problematic  certainly around august 9
when we started the interventions thats all understandable  but the committee made it very clear
at that time that it wasnt changing the targeted funds rate and yet for the past month it has been
essentially below  so in my mind that has raised three questions  one is a technical question about
our ability to actually target the fed funds rate using the procedures that we have in place  we
continue to quote a price target and try to control it using quantities  i still believe it would be a lot
easier just to set the price target and buy and sell  thats an operational question that i think is on
the table for another day  it also raised the question to me as i watched it going on why the desk
did not choose to intervene more frequently during the day to be more aggressive when they saw
that their forecast for the days balances was not accurate  there is nothing that says you cant go
back in during the day to help rectify some of that and id like some explanation as to why we
didnt do that or whether thats an option  the third question is actually a more serious one because
it combines a technical issue and a philosophical one  i think allowing the fed funds rate to trade so
low for so long away from our target really creates a credibility problem for this committee  it puts
us in an awkward position now because in effect it hasnt gone unnoticed by the investment
community  some have called it a stealth rate cut that is already in effect  some have said that
the fed has already cut the fed funds rate and it puts the committees decision today in a somewhat
awkward position because people look back and say well they have already done it  so i think
it is important that we think about mechanisms and ways to ensureat least going forwardthat if
the committee has a target we can be successful in achieving it  so id just like some further
enlightenment there if i could
mr dudley  turning first to your first question why we do it the way that we dowell
with the new authority to pay interest on reserves we are going to take a pretty broad look at the
whole issue of how we target the federal funds rate and how we manage reserves more generally
so i think thats a legitimate question and it is going to be done as part of that process  obviously
the way we do it today is based on a sort of historical evolution that started when the fed did not
reveal what the federal funds rate target was  so i think its probably fair to say that four or five
years from now when we have that new authority we may be doing things quite differently
in terms of the issue of going back in later in the day the problem there is that we dont
really know whats happening to the autonomous factors until the next morning  so we dont know
exactly how were doing in terms of tracking the reserve provisions relative to our forecast in real
time  we dont have that
mr plosser  but you see the rate
mr dudley  we do see the rate  we could be more aggressive and push people to the
window but i think it is important in this environment not to be contributing to market turmoil  we
felt that the right thing to do was to err on the side of not pushing people forcibly to the window
when the market was under some distress  i would also say that the fed funds rate while it has
traded soft it hasnt traded that soft  the effective rate so far this month has been 508 and i think
that coming into this meeting we have pretty much eliminated from the minds of people in the
markets that there was a stealth easing especially in light of where the federal funds rate has been
trading over the past week  so i dont see that as a significant issue for this meeting
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  bill i just want to make sure that i understand
what you said in your excellent presentation  i think i heard you say that as time passes investors
in the markets will become more discriminating  already were seeing signs of returning stability
im trying to differentiate between what we had earlierserious counterparty risk and phobias
and what we have nowwhich seems to be concerns about balance sheet risk  i want to understand
better the distinction between the two  i read egons briefing last night which by the way was very
very solid  what i read was that the largest banks are well positioned to absorb even larger
exposures than they currently anticipate and the number in that document was 1 trilliona
significant number for five banks to absorb  given what you just presented to usi think i
interpreted you correctlythe concern about counterparty risk is diminishing but it is still there
the balance sheet risk issue is somewhat defined although there are uncertaintiesyou mentioned
them yourself  theres headline risk which cuts two ways by the way and i want to talk about that
during my other intervention  there is also a surprise loss that might occur  could you distinguish
for us whether or not weve seen a reduction in counterparty risk and if so could you define it
somewhat  how serious is the balance sheet risk from your perspective against the background of
the briefing we received last night which indicated that it appears to be manageable
mr dudley  well its difficult to sort out exactly how much of that term premium that
we see in the term funding markets represents counterparty risk versus balance sheet constraints  i
think in the united states that it is probably more of a balance sheet issue  in europe its probably
more counterparty risk  the general sense is that the us banks are very healthy and as you note
well capitalized  however the fact that you still have quite a bit of room before you hit that
boundary of well capitalized doesnt mean that the banks arent concerned about potential balance
sheet pressures  the problem they have right now is that they cant really size with any accuracy
how much will be coming onto their balance sheets over the next few months through assetbacked
commercial paper through bank conduits and through other things for which they may be on the
hook that they didnt expect to be on the hook for  so i wouldnt take the boundary line of well
capitalized versus not well capitalized as the constraint  i think the constraint actually starts to
bind quite a bit before you get to that point
mr fisher  we talked about the conduit question somewhat on the calls  again i
assume weve done sensitivity analysis to the degree that we can in terms of the potential for having
to absorb some of that risk and bring it onto the balance sheet  is that correct
mr dudley  the analysis that has been done has suggested that the banks are well
capitalized and should with one or two exceptions be able to handle this balance sheet expansion
reasonably well but they cant say that with absolute certainty
mr fisher  of course of course
mr dudley  another thing happening is that there is a potential problem on the
earnings side  you can imagine a worst case scenario in which you cant syndicate any of the loans
and then the loans have to be marked down significantly  that has an earnings consequence  so
then the balance sheet is going to be affected not just by whats happening in terms of the assets but
also by whats happening in terms of the capital  i think the uncertainty about it will probably turn
out to be more of a problem than the actual reality but its going to take time for us to find out what
the actual reality is
mr fisher  may i ask one more question mr chairman  at the last meeting i asked
about commercial paper risk in europe and got nods of not a great risk  is there anything that you
see or that you can think of that we dont know or that hasnt been in this presentation that would
indicate significant potential for risk
mr dudley  i would hesitate to say that i know with any great clarity that theres
nothing else there in europe  i think we have all been a bit surprised by the size of some of the
conduits that some european banks were sponsoring relative to their capital  i would be very
hesitant to say that we have transparency regarding that marketplace and know with certainty that
theres nothing else there
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  i would like to return to the issues that president plosser raised which i think
are very serious for this committee  maybe the question is what you would have done differently
with the benefit of hindsight to have come closer to the target  my back of the envelope
calculation starting with august 9 or august 10 is that maybe the fed funds rate averaged about
5 percentso a full  percentage point below the target  if you felt constrained to enter the market
later in the day because of concerns about adding to turmoil you certainly could have consulted
with the committee about the tradeoff there  but it does seem to me that when we establish a
target we have an obligation to achieve that target  obviously early in the period erring on the side
of generosity was no problem but it seemed to me that we gave away some degrees of freedom
shall we say by the way things proceeded  i find that of considerable concern
mr dudley  but i would just reemphasize the fact that we did try to be stingy  our ex
ante provision of reserves was less than what we thought that the market needed and we thought
that would push up the federal funds rate  we do not have control over all the factors that affect the
demand for reserves and unfortunately they consistently came in on the side of adding more
reserves into the system than we intended  that said we have been pretty consistently trying to
push back on the market to get the effective federal funds rate back toward the target and i think we
can say that we made it by the meeting  i think there are very few people in the market today who
believe that theres a stealth easing in the market
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  just to reinforce what bill saidof course we spent a lot
of time thinking through exactly the risks that you are worried about in this context and well have
a lot to reflect on in terms of the nature of the regime and what the legislative authority gives us
going forward  but i think that bill and his people really had just a simple choice which was
particularly at that point late in august and early in septemberwhether they should have acted in
a way that raised the possibility of having fed funds trade significantly above target over this period
if you look at the experience of the other central banks managing this situation in the past six weeks
or so and what happened when they prematurely acted in a way that ended with having their rates
trade substantially firm to target and the effects of that on behavior and the market i am completely
confident that our guys erred in the right direction  i also dont believe just to reinforce what bill
said that anybody serious in the markets viewed what the desk was doing and the behavior
regarding where fed funds were traded as having a signaling effect or as constraining the flexibility
of the committee  it is true that you had a bunch of people in midaugust talking about that
possibility and wondering whether they should read the very soft trading of fed funds as an
indication of the stance of monetary policy going forward but i think that got sucked out of the
market relatively quickly
again i think youre raising absolutely the right questions  we grapple with those
questions every day  we basically made the judgment that to adopt a much more aggressive stance
in being stingy with the reserves at various points in this period would have created too much risk of
fed funds trading firm relative to target at a moment when psychology and confidence were very
very fragile  i really think the experience of other central banks was a good counter example of the
cost of the alternative strategy  now of course we will have a chance over time to go back and do
a much more detailed review
another thing i would say about coming in later in the day is that its very important to have
some stability in the basic framework with which the desk operates particularly after what we did
the week before august 17 and on august 17  to have a lot of changes at the same time in the
standard operating procedures of the desk would have created more risk of uncertainty about what
we were doing  we were trying to find a balance between the imperatives of a relatively steady
hand and the risk that you are phrasing in absolutely legitimate questions  well have a chance to
reflect on a lot of things after this period but my own view is that they made exactly the right
judgment
chairman bernanke  one complexity in this whole period is that there is a
surprisingly large demand for dollars in europe which of course is early in the day  so the fed
funds rate was opening very very high very tight and then there were judgments about how to
bring it down during the peak trading period of the us markets  that led to guesses about how
many reserves to inject before the end of the day  so the dysfunction in the normal interbank
market processprecautionary demand for dollars in europeled to some very unusual stresses
early in the day which complicated bills job considerably
mr fisher  we still love bill by the way
chairman bernanke  oh we all love bill  laughter
mr dudley  for the record i laughed
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i want to ask about the term funding market and i want you to help us
understand what we know about that  in typical times like before this do we know how much
lending was done at term in the fed funds market  do we know what names were typically
involvedis there a flow across the banking system of some particular structureand what kind of
spreads are typical  then what have we been observing now in contrast  related to this do we
know what names are borrowing at term now  do we have a sense of the extent to which the
elevated spread is a risk premium or some other effect  are people who are borrowing at term
tapped out at the home loan bank  does that have some significance in the term market  is there
an interaction between options at the home loan bank and the term market
mr dudley  on the question about volume theres no question that volume went up
considerably in the overnight marketabout 20 percent as near as we can judge over this period
since the term market was mostly shut down especially in term fed funds there has been very little
in term fed funds trading  you can almost infer that most volume is done overnight but probably
20 percent or so is done term  almost all of that crowded back into the overnight market  so there
was an increase as near as we can measure of about 20 percent in overnight fed funds activity over
the past month compared with normal  now in terms of who is actually borrowing at termwell
very few people were actually borrowing at term  there was probably a bit of a lemons problem
in the term market in the sense thatbecause term rates were elevated and those rates were not very
attractive economicallyyour wanting to borrow in the term market was a sign that you were
probably not in good shape in terms of your own liquidity position  i think that contributed to the
shutdown of the term market  because of the economics reallywhy are you doing that unless
youre in bad shape and you really need the funds  i think that contributed to the shrinking of the
term market  really two things were going on  one banks that had the funds to lend didnt want to
lend term because they werent sure what they would need that money for down the road
depending on what was going to come onto their balance sheets  two people who wanted to
borrow term were the least attractive borrowers  that caused the market to essentially dry up over
this period  i think it is starting to come back  were not back to normal because obviously the
term rates are still somewhat elevated relative to the overnight rate  so its still not that attractive
from an economic perspective but it is certainly more attractive than it was even a week ago
mr lacker  if i could just follow up i know the desk tracks overnight fed funds trades
and you get from the dealers the quantities at different rates in order to calculate the effective rate
are you inferring term volume from that or do we have any other independent quantitative sources
on the volume of term funding
mr dudley  i havent actually seen any volume data on term  they may in fact exist
what we did though is look at the volume in the overnight federal funds market and we saw that
go up about 20 percent  so if you start with the premise that the banks that have excess funds to
lend arent going to change much month to month you can pretty much infer that most of it is
coming out of the term market
mr lacker  both large banks in our district have gone from being net borrowers to
being large net lenders  one in fact says its the largest in the market and lends 10 billion to
15 billion every night overnight and they used to borrow a couple of billion dollars every day
could something like that account for the volume in the funds market
mr dudley  yes obviously that moves in that direction but if i remember correctly
the number on the volume of the fed funds market is in the 400 billion to 500 billion range
twenty percent on that kind of level is quite a bit bigger than what youre seeing
mr lacker  okay
mr madigan  that would include brokered trades and nonbrokered trades
vice chairman geithner  but mr chairman if im not mistaken i think that the
term market for interbank liquidity is largely offshore in europe not in fed funds onshore  im not
sure that helps when we get into this context
mr lacker  right  i was asking about the demand  i was curious about what we know
about the domestic part
vice chairman geithner  our research people have tried to figure out whether they
could infer or take from fedwire data other indications of whos lending at what maturities and
whos borrowing at what maturities and what the balance is  my own sense from looking at this
and maybe i just havent figured it out yet is that it doesnt give you the kind of clarity that you
were looking for
mr dudley  its an overthecounter market and in most overthecounter markets we
do not have the kind of volume data we would like to have
mr lacker  just one tiny thingin the overnight market from the brokers we have
volumes traded at different rates  for the term fed funds rate which is showing up in a graph or
twoi cant remember wheredoes that come off broker screens  we dont have trades on that
do we
mr dudley  i dont know the answer to that
mr madigan  there is not a regular data source
mr lacker  all right  thanks
chairman bernanke  are there other questions for bill  if not i need a vote to
ratify domestic open market operations
mr poole  so moved
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  may we turn now to the staff
presentation on the economic situation  dave stockton and karen johnson will start with the
economic overview and then brian will make a few comments on the projections that we
submitted  dave
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  this has been a far from placid time  indeed the intermeeting period has been marked by financial tumult of such a magnitude as to significantly alter the outlook for the economy  a deeper retrenchment in us stock markets morecautious credit provision and moreserious disruptions to economic growth abroad are now expected to combine to produce a sharper deceleration in output than we had projected in august  these words were taken from the first page in the greenbook of september 1998  laughter  while the particulars obviously differ in many important respects from that period we once again face substantial financial turbulence and once again we have marked down our projection of real activity on the expectation that recent financial developments will impart considerable restraint on activity in the quarters ahead  before explaining these changes let me read to you from the first page of another greenbook and i quote the economy has continued to exhibit remarkable dynamism generating hefty gains in employment and income  we have tacked about  percentage point onto our previous forecast of firstquarter real gdp growth and the evident momentum of domestic demand has led us to elevate our projection for output growth over the near term a bit as well  that passage was taken from the greenbook of march 1999 just six months after the onset of that period of financial disturbance
needless to say the experience of that episode was not lost on us as we approached the construction of the current forecast  but neither were the episodes of the summer of 1990 and the fall of 2000 when we thought financial and other factors
would result in a period of belowtrend growth but that outright recession would be avoided  so the question is are we projecting too much or too little weakness in real activity over the next several quarters  answering that question has two aspects
one is whether we have correctly gauged the magnitude of the potential restraint on real activity arising from the recent developments in mortgage and other credit markets  the other is whether we have appropriately assessed the underlying strength of the economy being subjected to those shocks  i think its fair to say that part of our mistake in 1998 was a failure to appreciate just how strong the us economy was as we entered that period
could we be making that mistake again  possibly  the incoming data did lead us to revise up our estimates of the growth in real gdp in the second and third quarters by  and  percentage point respectively  most notably consumer spending has surprised us to the upside  last fridays report on retail sales provided another positive innovation  although the spending figures for august were right in line with our expectations the upward revision to july suggests that the growth of real pce in the third quarter will be about  percentage point stronger than we projected in last weeks greenbook  elsewhere the growth of exports has continued to outstrip our expectations providing greater impetus to domestic production  that added impetus may help explain factory output which has also been a bit stronger on net than anticipated in our august projection  manufacturing ip excluding motor vehicles is estimated to have fallen 03 percent last month but that decline came on the heels of upwardrevised increases of 07 percent in june and july  we are now projecting manufacturing ip excluding motor vehicles to have increased 4 percent in the third quarter a bit more than in our august forecast
not all the news however has been favorable  despite a rebound in motor vehicle sales in august the automakers still found themselves with uncomfortably high inventories at the end of the summer and have announced substantial reductions in assembly schedules for the fourth quarter  in our projection the cut in motor vehicle production lops  percentage point off the growth of real gdp in the fourth quarter about  percentage point more than we had earlier expected  the labor market report also was a bit weaker than we had penciled into our projection at the time of the august fomc meeting  private payrolls increased just 24000 last month which combined with downward revisions in june and july left the level of employment about 100000 shy of our expectations  nevertheless we didnt attach a great deal of signal to the employment report in terms of its implications for real activity  as you know despite the fact that real gdp was coming in close to our expectations most of this year we had been fairly consistently surprised to the upside by employment  for the most part we had attributed that surprising strength to an unusual degree of labor hoarding that was resulting in a morepronounced cyclical  sag in productivity than is typical  now that the employment figures have softened we are inclined to let much of that softness show through in higher labor productivity rather than weaker output  still there is no denying that labor demand over the past three months now looks a bit weaker than we expected
we see the incoming data taken together as suggesting that there was a bit more strength to the expansion through the summer than we had earlier recognized  but we have seen little to suggest that the economy was either gathering any momentum or seriously faltering as we entered the period of increased financial turbulence
obviously getting the starting point right for the projection is important  but the main action in this forecast has been our reaction to developments in mortgage and other credit markets  i would love to dazzle you this morning with precise scientific estimates of the effects on spending and activity of difficulties involving subprime mortgages structuredinvestment vehicles leveraged loans and the like  but sadly that will not be the case  rather because you seem to be on the brink of joining me in the humbling world of forecasting i thought that i would invite you to don your hair nets and white butcher smocks and join me for a tour of the sausage factory laughter
the difficulty we confronted in this forecast is that even after decades worth of research on credit channels and financial acceleratorsmuch of it done by economists at all levels in the federal reserve systemthe financial transmission mechanisms in most of the workhorse macro models that we use for forecasting are still rudimentary  as a result much of what has occurred doesnt even directly feed into our models  but that doesnt mean that it isnt important  indeed the residuals  in our main spending equations seem to be negatively correlated with measures of financial stress  in other words our models tend to overpredict spending in periods of financial disturbance  to be sure that general tendency is not evident in all episodes shortfalls in spending were sizable in the headwinds period of the early 1990s and in the aftermath of the stock market collapse in the early part of this decade  but we have found little evidence of any material effects on spending during the 199899 episode  in very broad terms we were guided in our revisions to the forecast by the average historical tendency of these spending equations to overpredict in periods of financial stress  as for the specifics we made adjustments in those areas that seem most likely to be affected in this particular episode
housing of course is at the epicenter of the current financial shock  in response to the intensifying problems in mortgage markets and the increasingly bleak anecdotes we slashed our housing forecast significantly further  we now expect new home sales to drop another 18 percent by the end of this year and singlefamily starts to drop another 25 percent by early next year  if this forecast comes to pass this housing downturn will come close to matching in severity that of the late 1970s and early 1980s  underlying this projection is an assumption that nonprime originations will remain virtually dead in coming months and stage only a modest and partial rebound over the next year and a half  we also expect some of the spillover that we have seen recently in prime jumbo mortgages to persist for a while though the effects on housing demand from this part of the market are likely to be much smaller
moreover in contrast to the partial recovery in nonprime mortgage originations we are expecting a full recovery in jumbo mortgages to occur by early 2009  obviously our estimates of the effects emanating from nonprime and jumbo markets are subject to considerable uncertaintyin terms of both depth and duration
as for the rest of the economy we dont think it will escape entirely unscathed by the recent turmoil in financial markets and we have made some modest downward adjustments also to business investment and consumer spending  in particular we have marked down a bit our forecast for nonresidential construction on the expectation that higher borrowing costs and tighter underwriting standards will hold down the volume of commercial real estate lending and construction activity in coming quarters  in that regard we have already seen some increase in busted contracts for commercial property transactions  like the effects in residential mortgage markets the restraining influences on commercial construction are assumed to fade by the end of next year  we have also revised down our projection for equipment spending but here the story is a bit different because we are not really anticipating a spillover that will result in significant funding problems for most nonfinancial firms  rather in previous forecasts we had incorporated an extra dollop of spending growth to reflect the general strength of corporate balance sheets and the tendency of some of our models to underpredict equipment spending over the past few years  with heightened uncertainty and less favorable financial conditions we have moved the es forecast down closer to the models in both our august and our september forecasts  finally we made a modest downward adjustment to our consumption forecast in part to account for the likelihood of some tightening of  terms and standards on consumer lending and for the possibility that weaker home prices may make it more difficult or expensive for households to finance consumption through the equity in their homes  we also assume that there will be some hit to consumer sentiment in an economy with a weakening labor market ongoing strains in financial markets and continuing downbeat news on house prices home sales and foreclosures  the restraint imposed by these factors is assumed to fade over the next yearagain on much the same schedule as we are expecting the financial restraints to lessen
i think we have the sign right here but i must admit that this element of our forecast seems the most problematic to me  to be sure weve already seen a fall in consumer sentiment that if sustained would imply a drag on spending going forward that is at least as large as is incorporated in our forecast  still the direct fallout of recent developments for the cost and availability of consumer credit could be quite limited and consumer sentiment could recover more quickly than is assumed in the baseline  i would be more worried about the upside risks of this aspect of our projection if i didnt also see some sizable downside risks to other elements of our baseline forecast  first even with the 5 percent decline we have projected over the next two years house prices will remain at historically high levels relative to rents  with foreclosures increasing there is a clear risk that the drop in home prices could well be deeper and faster than we expect  second implicit in our forecast is the assumption that we are experiencing the worst of the financial turmoil now there would seem to be more downside risk than upside risk to this assumption  finally we are still projecting what amounts to a very soft landing  the unemployment rate rises by a few tenths growth converges to
potential and inflation levels out near current rates  such an outcome would be nearly unprecedented
turning to our inflation forecast we did not receive any news that materially affected our outlook  both headline and core pce prices in july came in a bit lower than we had been forecasting  for the most part the key conditioning factors governing our inflation projection changed little over the intermeeting period  food and energy prices were nearly unrevised nonoil import prices were a touch lower reflecting lower commodity prices and most measures of inflation expectations have been roughly unchanged  the only adjustment of note in our inflation forecast was the  percentage point reduction that we made in our estimate of the nairu we did so because of some tendency of our wage and price equations to overpredict inflation over the past few years and because weve seen a continuation of some of the structural forces in labor markets that we thought had lowered the nairu in earlier periods  the adjustment also better aligns our estimate of the nairu with other readings of labor market tightness
all told some slack in resource utilization now emerges in this forecast
however because the estimated slope of our aggregate supply function is quite flat and inflation expectations are expected to remain reasonably well anchored this change is pretty small potatoes for our price forecast  indeed it trimmed only
01 percentage point from our forecast of overall and core pce price inflation in both 2008 and 2009  that concludes my tour of the sausage factory  i hope it was somewhat revealing though i recognize that sausage factories can test the convictions of even the most ardent proponents of full transparency  karen will now continue our presentation
ms johnson  in the international division we too were challenged to assess the avalanche of events and information that arrived during the intermeeting period and to make our best judgment as to how these developments would affect the rest of the global economy and the us external sector  one striking feature of the baseline forecast that resulted is the difference between prospects for the industrial countries and those for the emergingmarket economies  for the industrial countries the surprises in the latest data were generally negative and considerable financial turmoil has been evident in the markets in the euro area the united kingdom and canada
in contrast the most recent surprises in economic data for the emergingmarket economies have generally been positive and so far there has been little evidence of financial disruption in those countries  we have revised down total foreign growth a bit less than  percentage point for the second half of this year and  percentage point for next year  this downward revision is due entirely to revisions to projected average growth in the industrial countries
the foreign industrial countries are largely being spared the direct effects of contraction in the residential construction sector so far  but they are vulnerable to negative effects on the pace of overall economic activity from increased volatility and impaired functionality in financial markets  as market participants have demanded
higher returns for risky assets and have withdrawn from some exposures many asset prices in europe and canada have fallen sharply  as in the united states these developments have had implications for bank balance sheets and earnings as banks have experienced calls on lines of credit or have taken other steps in response to funding difficulties of conduits and other entities sponsored by them  some markets have experienced severe disruption particularly european abcp and a portion of the canadian abcp market  although it is too soon for us to have actual data on the consequences of stresses being put on bank balance sheets we think it is likely that some constraint on credit extension will result  in addition business and consumer confidence could well be impaired by the general awareness of heightened risk and uncertainty as strains persist in financial markets  we have very little historical experience on which to base a projection of the magnitude of these effects  our downward revision of the forecast for real gdp growth in the industrial countries in response to recent financial market events has been small but we acknowledge that recent financial events have been severe and have lasted long enough that they likely will have some effect on domestic demand in the affected countries
other channels of transmission from developments over the intermeeting period are more straightforward  the downward revision to us real output growth causes us to lessen projected export demand growth in our trading partners for canada this channel could be particularly strong  in exchange markets the intermeeting period has seen upward pressure emerge on the euro with the dollareuro rate reaching new highs  this euro appreciation should weaken demand by other countries for exports from the euro area  the downward revision of real growth in the united states and in other industrial countries should in turn reduce demand for exports from emerging market economies
economic indicators of activity from months before august have also led us to revise down projected growth in the major foreign industrial countries  in canada both retail sales and real manufacturing shipments fell in june  in japan second quarter real gdp growth has been revised to show a decline of more than 1 percent at an annual rate and industrial production and real household expenditures fell in july in the euro area some moderation in expansion is implied by recent data  real gdp decelerated in the second quarter and a number of measures of business sentiment some of which contain responses after august 9 have moved lower  taking all this together we revised down our outlook for real gdp growth in the foreign industrial countries with the change for the second half negative  percentage point at an annual rate  accordingly we now expect that monetary tightening measures in those countries this year and next which we and the markets had been projecting in august will not occur except in japan
the upward revision of our figure for average secondquarter real gdp growth in the emergingmarket economies from 6 percent at an annual rate to about 7 percent is indicative of the magnitude of positive surprises we received about activity in these regions  the news was broadly based across asia latin america and other areas
importantly at the time of the august greenbook we had already received data on
chinas nearly 15 percent real growth in the second quarter so the developments underlying this upward revision arose outside china  our forecast calls for real growth in the emergingmarket economies to slow to a more sustainable pace of nearly 5 percent over the forecast period from the very rapid secondquarter outcome we judge that going forward the upward boost provided by faster activity earlier this year is about offset by the implications of the weaker outlook for the united states and other industrial country economies and so our projection for real expansion in the emerging world is about unchanged from august  at this time we do not see sufficient evidence of financial stress in these countries to warrant incorporating into the forecast restraint from credit channels or from confidence effects
we do recognize that there are risks to the moderately strong forecast we have for the emergingmarket economies  on the upside with the pace of growth so strong in china we may once again find that the government is unable to put in place sufficient restraint to cause a discrete stepdown in real output growth there  however chinese stock prices have continued to rise very sharply and we see a possible downside risk to growth from a bursting of that bubble with consequent effects on real spending  it is also possible that we are underestimating the spillover of contractionary pressures from the industrial countries onto activity in the rest of the world  for example one channel by which such forces could weaken activity in mexico more than we now expect is through reduced remittances  with the us construction sector particularly weak earnings of immigrant labor and remittances to mexico could be reduced and the result could be a slowing of growth in mexico by more than we have forecast
another element of the forecast worth a brief mention is the price of crude oil the price for spot wti recently surged above 80 per barrel as recent data on us inventories and some signs of hurricane activity led market participants to bid up prices for very near term oil  however prices further out on the futures curve have moved down since august and our overall path for the price of us oil imports is little changed to down slightly by the end of 2008  with the futures curve showing pronounced backwardation the spot price is very sensitive to unfolding news  should a serious hurricane or some other factor threaten nearterm production we could see an outsized reaction in the spot price of crude oil
with the shock to the global economy this time arising largely in the us economy it is fitting that we might look to the rest of the world to provide some support to overall demand some contribution to stabilizing global economic activity in general and some help in damping rather than augmenting fluctuations in us economic activity  as we now read the evidence such an outcome is likely this time strength in the most recent data has led us to revise up projected real export growth in the third quarter  although foreign gdp growth has been revised down a bit thereby weakening exports the dollar is on a path slightly lower than in august and relative prices should provide a bit more boost to exports than we previously thought  all in all the contribution to us real gdp growth from exports should be somewhat more positive over the forecast period than we expected in august despite the global financial turmoil  if the greenbook forecast is realized net exports should make a
positive arithmetic contribution to us real gdp growth of about  percentage point during the second half of this year and about  percentage point next year  brian will now continue our remarks
mr madigan2  i will be referring to the table in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on september trialrun projections  i will first focus on the near term  the upper panel of the table shows the forecasts for the second half of the year that are implied by the estimates that you submitted for the first half of 2007 and your projections for the year as a whole  participants revised down their expectations for real gdp growth in the second half of 2007 by several tenths of a percentage point  most of you cited the steeperthanexpected downturn in housing
markets and tighter credit conditions as key factors  the downward revision to output growth was accompanied by a slight upward revision to the unemployment rate
your forecast for total inflation in the second half of this year was revised down noticeably but the central tendency for core inflation was unrevised  almost all of you conditioned your outlook on nearterm monetary policy easing  a slight majority characterized the greenbooks assumption of a 50 basis point nearterm reduction in the target funds rate as appropriate monetary policy but almost as many think a somewhat larger cumulative decline will prove appropriate
the lower panel shows your annual forecasts  the central tendency for gdp growth in 2008 was revised down about  percentage point and now centers on about 2 percent rather than 2 percent  the central tendency for the unemployment rate at the end of the year revised up 02 percentage point  your total inflation forecast for next year edged down 01 percentage point but the central tendency of your core projections was unchanged  you also again characterized your views of uncertainty relative to historical norms and skews  those views presumably apply primarily to the relatively near term outlook  most of you again see risks to growth as tilted to the downside  in contrast almost all of you now see inflation risks as roughly balanced rather than as tilted to the upside  a majority of you judge that the uncertainty attending the prospects for economic activity is greater than has been typical in the past
looking further ahead the projections for 2009 changed little  for the first time you submitted forecasts for 2010  the forecasts for those years and your commentary suggest that most of you see actual and potential gdp growth over that period at around 2 percent a bit above the staffs estimate  the unemployment rate hovers just below 5 percent  let me note at this point that in the table there is a typo in the 2009 column for the unemployment rate  the central tendency of august projections should read 47 to 50 percent  with the unemployment rate just a bit above the
4 percent that a number of you have identified as your estimate of the nairu both core inflation and total inflation are expected to edge lower in the out yearsat least if you squint hard and focus particularly on the lower bound of the central tendencies laughter  your forecasts for core and total inflation in 2009 are essentially unrevisednot surprisingly if you view those forecasts as reflecting to an important

2  materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
degree your longerrun objectives  the relatively narrow central tendencies and ranges for total and core inflation in 2009 and 2010 suggest substantial agreement in your views on this score  that concludes our presentation
chairman bernanke  thank you  mr stockton has been reading upton sinclair
i think  laughter  questions for our colleagues  president evans
mr evans  dave your presentation seemed to hit on all the right points with regard to
the forecast  i am reminded though that chicago is no longer the hog butcher capital of the
world  laughter  still i have a forecasting question  in the briefing yesterday you quantified
the financial stress effects on gdp growth that you talked about this morning as about 
percentage point in the second half of this year and about  percentage point in 2008  having
read the alternative simulations for a number of years i know it is not uncommon for an
alternative that starts off with financial difficulties to have a small effect on the outlook then
there is a layering on of the consumer sentiment and it drops off a little more  so i am curious
about sorting out these components with an idea toward if the policy action were taken as a form
of insurance against these risks what the early warning signs that those insurance reasons are
really no longer critical would be  would we quickly see objective measures of the turnaround
is consumer sentiment the key  presumably financial conditions would be a little more evident
in their improvement
mr stockton  in this particular forecast the housing revision is basically all driven
off our assumptions about the difficulties in financial markets  there are no additional
sentimenttype effects there  on commercial real estate id say pretty much the same thing  as
i noted in my briefing the area where we have ventured into a looser sort of approach would be
on the consumer spending side where we are not really expecting a significant amount  we
would expect some restraint on consumer lending and consumer borrowing associated with
tighter underwriting so there will be some increase in cost  but i dont think those effects are
likely to be large  here we are relying more on an assumption that some disturbance to
consumer sentiment will persist into next year  one thing that i would be looking forfor that
piece of the forecast to be wrong and therefore for there to be more underlying strength in the
economywould be a quicker rebound in consumer sentiment and a moving up to the low 90s in
relatively short order  that piece of what we built into the forecast would look to be
questionable and might be worth a couple of tenths on the level of gdp next year
the other area where i would be looking if i were in your shoes and auditing our forecast
is that we are expecting the labor market to be quite weak moving into the fourth quarter and by
the end of the fourth quarter no employment growth basically flat employment  thus far we
have seen some uptick in initial claims for unemployment insurance  that seems consistent with
some of the slowing that we have already seen  but i think we would have to see a further rise
there to be consistent with the weakness that we are expecting in the labor markets  if that were
not to occur it would suggest again that we are likely to be off the mark on the weakness in
activity that we are projecting  so i would say that those two areas would be at the top of my list
for monitoring the weakness of the forecast
the factory sector would be the final area where i think again we get relatively timely
informationsome of it physical product data not just data based on the labor market  we are
expecting things to be a little weaker than they were in the middle of the summer but not so weak
as they were in august  however if we saw continued strength there i think that would suggest
some inconsistency with the weakness of our forecast
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  my first question was very much related to
what charlie just asked  first let me say that i appreciate the tour of the sausage factory  it was
a little bloody but i want to commend you in that i think it was a fairly balanced way of looking
at what the risks are in various places  but i want to come back to my interpretation of what you
just said  your answer to president evans sounded to me as though a significant part of your
downward revision particularly to consumption was the factor of consumer sentiment which is
looming rather large in this forecast  while youve revised down some other things it sounded
as though you were saying that consumer sentiment is a particularly sensitive and difficult thing
to forecast  we know it is very volatile it can change rapidly  but i heard you say that in the
forecast you have implicitly reduced consumer spending and held it low for a period of time into
the forecast  am i misinterpreting your answer there
mr stockton  that is basically correct  i mean we expect some recovery  we
werent expecting that august figure to prevail through the forecast period  if that were to occur
we would be looking at an even weaker outlook than we are seeing  again in all these things i
dont want to make it sound too precise but we do think underwriting standards and the cost of
consumer credit are likely to increase and that rise is likely to impinge on consumer spending
in our models the fed funds rate shows up in our consumption equation  we have some
consumption equations that we run with consumer credit rates  they dont actually do any better
than our standard equation  so we have added a little for something that we think is outside the
model on consumption probably operating through the credit channel  but i dont want to deny
that in some sense again if we saw a significant rebound in consumer sentiment from its current
levels into the low 90s it would be inconsistent with what we are currently forecasting
mr plosser  that would be a significant change from the standpoint of how you are
viewing the forecast
mr stockton  that would raise the forecast as i said
mr plosser  my impression from studies and empirical work is that consumer
sentiment usually is a much bigger coincident indicator than it is a forecasting tool
mr stockton  yes it helps for forecasting nearterm consumption  but you are
right i dont think the low level of consumer sentiment that we have seen through the middle of
september is telling us a great deal about where consumer spending will be early next year
there is not a lot of predictive content that way
mr plosser  yes  thats really my point
mr stockton  therefore in some sense to be consistent with the forecast we
would have to continue to expect that consumers are going to be worried and more downbeat
again while i would say thats obviously a significant source of uncertainty i dont think thats
necessarily unreasonable in an environment where there will continue to be a lot of bad news and
where the bad news is compounded with a weakening labor market and some things that could
lead to some extramodel type of restraint
mr plosser  i appreciate that clarification  the other question i had has more to do
with the nairu and employment issues  i wish you could clarify a bit for methe downward
shift in employment numbers for the past three months is for me significant  at the same time i
say to myself well you know now it is about at the level that the board has been forecasting
all along  in your previous discussions you have talked about participation rates and other
things and now the level seems to be about where you had been predicting it all along  yet you
still interpret that as bad news from the economy point of view  so i would like a little
discussion of that  the second thing is that at the same time you have lowered the nairu  i
am a bit puzzled and would like a little discussion about the interaction between those two
things  finallyand you may have said this but i may have missed itif you had not changed
the nairu would inflation have been 01 or 02 percentage point higher over the forecast
period  or what would it have been  i just need a little clarification
mr stockton  on that last point i think it probably would have been a little higher
but if we hadnt revised the nairu we might also have had a higher unemployment forecast
going forward  it wouldnt be just like everything else equal if we lowered the nairu  i
think it did contribute to a slightly larger output gap in this forecast but also contributing to the
larger output gap in this forecast was a weakening of activity relative to potential that we are
assuming is going to be driven by this  we are really splitting hairs because as i indicated we
changed the forecast only 01 in each year but it would have been a little less than that had we
not changed the nairu
on the first point about our interpretation of employment i was trying to convey a sense
that a lot of people were very surprised at how weak employment was  we have been expecting
weak employment  i think we were less surprised  we also as i indicated had written off some
of this weakness in employment as sort of extracyclical labor hoarding and we hadnt really
bought in fully to that  we let that show through in lower labor productivity  now that we have
actually seen some of the weakness that we were expecting all along we dont think there was as
much labor hoarding as we previously thought  so it wasnt as big a surprise  still there is just
no denying the fact that the labor market report was weaker  even if we had gone back to where
we were we werent expecting things to be that weak  so i think there was some small negative
signal attached to the labor market report but probably not as much as would be suggested by the
market reaction
mr plosser  thank you
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  what do we know about the likelihood of an
auto strike what might come out of it and how long it might last  second karen my sense is
that the financial markets in the united kingdom are probably the most disrupted of any of the
industrial economies  perhaps you could comment a bit more on that
mr stockton  so thus farunless something has happened while we have been
sitting here that i dont know about and you doi think things look reasonably encouraging on
the labor front with the auto negotiations  we are not expecting a strike in fact we are
expecting them to work through the final details  obviously the creation of the trust fund for
health expenditures is one of the biggest remaining issues  but the fact that it is still on the table
and is still being actively discussed leads us to think that a strike is not likely at this point
ms johnson  the situation in the united kingdom is an unfolding drama that is just
a soap opera in many respects  at the root there seem to be some severe differences of opinion
of what the right response is to situations in the markets  in the beginning there was virtually no
explicit action by the bank of england to counter heightened demand for liquidity on the part of
banks in uk markets  so the spreads of overnight pound libor relative to target opened up
widely and they were not addressed  they were allowed to just sort of sit there  the term
pound market had a problem too  of course many of the dollar issues that we have spoken of
and that bill talked aboutare really being captured as a london phenomenon  but you might
say that from the point of view of the bank of england or the uk economy these dollar issues
are somewhat separate from the domestic economy  there is some truth to that but also the
institutions are involved the institutions have obligations and the shocks to the institutions
reverberate back into the domestic economy it seems to me  that process went on for a while
and it is to some degree a function of the way the bank of england manages its reserves and the
system of reserve market interaction that exists  it has among other features a monthly
timetable not a twoweek timetable so even though the bank of england operates daily in the
sense that we do it ties its own hands a bit each month  toward the end of the month in which
august 9 occurred it announced that the subsequent month it was going to ease things just a bit
in response to a lot of pressure both perhaps from disagreements inside the bank and criticisms of
the bank  it has taken some steps to provide for greater flexibility within its existing system than
it had for the three weeks before the month turnover in august  indeed the bank of england did
a twoday operation last night or this morning uk time which is the first temporary extra
injection of reserves it had done on this basis  so it is moving in the direction of introducing
flexibility into the market that was not there on august 9 and wasnt there for some time after
august 9
i think there is a great concern in the bank of england or certainly in the person of
mervyn king with the moral hazard aspects of enabling the markets to solve their problems and
deal with the consequences of their own decisions by the bank of englands providing them
more liquidity  that lies behind some of his reluctance  on the other hand we now have the
northern rock issue  that is somewhat distinct from the problems of overnight lending or even
term lending in that northern rock has been questionable for a while has been looked at for a
while has been kind of talked about a bit but has not really been on anybodys radar screen for a
while  it is an institution that funded itself to an exceptional extent in wholesale markets as
opposed to from a deposit base and yet it had grown to be a very very large mortgage lender in
the united kingdom  one might say that it is a bad coincidence that somehow northern rock
hit a turning point this month but that is perhaps going too far  i think the fact that the wholesale
markets were disrupted had to interact with its business plan had to be part of the reason that
concerns that have been festering for a while became acute and so forth  the actions that the
bank of england took with respect to northern rock were really from its lenderoflastresort
institutionbased mechanisms as opposed to market concerns  but they came out basically on the
same day  they announced that they were going to introduce flexibility into their reserves
management system and a different announcement was all about northern rock  they got it
wrong on northern rock quite understandably  that too was a function of their deposit
insurance system which is now under review because it is prone to this sort of thing  it was just
if you will one thing after another all of which are interacting
we have revised down somewhat our uk gdp forecast  in general the industrial
countries are where we see the weakness  that economy was in terms of domestic demand
pretty strong  we think it can absorb some of this  but the set of factors is very complexsome
of them are deep and structural like the way they do deposit insurance some of them have been
ongoing for a while and some of them are related to this crisis  i think the differences of opinion
among the financial services authority the treasury and the bank of england arent helping
the differences of opinion within the bank of england arent helping and the situation remains to
be totally sorted out
chairman bernanke  i see a twohanded intervention
mr mishkin  yes  just a question really for bill and brian  one thing that is
positive about all of thisalthough maybe im wrong about itis that the spillovers into the
other markets outside the united kingdom have been very very minor  normally whats
happening in the uk context would be an information shock that could trigger problems  the
good news here is that if anything the markets have actually gotten a little better since this
whole episode occurred and it has been contained in the uk context  is this a fair assessment
mr dudley  yes i agree with that
mr mishkin  it is really an important issue
mr dudley  three weeks ago if this had happened i think there would have been a
different market reaction  the market reaction has been very mild  they seem to be able to sort
it out as a specific problem pertaining to northern rock and the uk regulatory regime not
something that applies to a broader market  so i agree with that
ms johnson  but i have to sayas when president fisher asked that question about
whether we know what we dont know to which of course the answer is always no
laughter five days ago i wouldnt have brought up northern rock  so i cant promise you
that there arent
mr fisher  previously newcastle should have been called sandcastle  laughter
ms johnson  the spanish banks for example and the spanish mortgage market are
places if i were going to dig deeper and look for hidden problems that are a possibility
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  i wont ask a silly question like the one i asked before  i just have two
quick questions one for dave and the other for karen  when we look at the labor situation
from an analytical standpoint it seems to me that there is cognitive dissonance between that and
what we are hearing anecdotally  what im hearing anecdotallyand i will talk a bit about that
in a minute but id like your viewpointare still complaints about labor shortages from bank
tellers to chemical workers to hotel maids et cetera et cetera et cetera  you see it in the beige
book  you hear it from the ceos with whom ive talked  you see it district by district  how
do you square these two corners dave  thats my question for you
then for karen my question is this  you talked about the nonindustrial country
growth  i would submit by the way that those are the industrial countries now in terms of how
they are fueling their growth what we call industrial countries are servicedriven economies
setting that aside you talked about the impact on growth and you mentioned oil in particular  i
would like to get your views on the potential inflationary impact from the kind of demand
growth that we are seeing and the growth that you are projecting elsewhere in the world
mr stockton  the way i square the corners is that even by our estimates the labor
market is still tight  the 4 percent unemployment is still below the 4 that we are estimating
the nairu to be  even on our forecast of the labor market the unemployment rate doesnt get
to the nairu until the middle of next year  so it wouldnt surprise me if some complaints about
availability of labor linger for a while here  the labor market even with our weak employment
forecast only gradually begins to loosen up  really not until next year would we have
something approaching an equilibrium in the labor market and then beyond that before we got
some slack  i think there is sort of a level versus a change issue here  the current state of the
labor market is tight even though we are forecasting it to deteriorate going forward
mr fisher  thank you
ms johnson  i think there are some inflation risks out there  in general mexico say
or brazilsome of the countries that target inflationare operating pretty near their target
maybe even a tiny bit above it  one of the preaugust but sort of persistent problems we have
been facing for about six to nine months maybe even for a year has been to understand food
prices  why does everybody say that our inflation is up but it is food prices  sometimes its hog
disease in china and sometimes its an allusion to biofuel issues or other kinds of oneoff things
that you might see in some emergingmarket countries  but the strength of demand in these
economiesand asia is really operating at a very high level of capacity and at a very strong
growth rateraises the potential for upward pressure on prices in some of these countries  now
china is obviously an outlier in this regard right  the numbers are crazy the numbers arent
trusted  again the government says it is food  but if most of the food is domestically produced
and food is approximately onethird of the weight in their cpi maybe thats where you ought to
look  the most important thing you can do with respect to trying to achieve an inflation
objective would be to do something about food prices either by addressing your supplyside
policies or by doing something about the rate of money growth or both  so china is a unique
case in this regard  i think people are very skeptical about some of the data  people fear that the
inflation problem might be even worse  it has always seemed to me that the obvious solution to
chinas problem is to let the exchange rate rise  it would solve many many ills including
lowering food prices and getting the inflation rate down  i dont hold out much hope for that
in places where markets are more effective and where monetary policy works in ways
that look more like our experience in the servicesector economies we are probably going to see
some monetary tightening continue to be in place  some of those countries are experiencing a
little exchange rate appreciation and that will help  but i think they are operating with as much
inflation as they really want  the industrial countries probably wont be doing some of the
tightening that we had in mind for them and that the markets anticipated but some of these
emerging marketsindia for exampleneed to continue tightening and they need to be very
alert on their monetary policy  there could be some cases in which their policies arent able to
do the job or they dont move quickly enough
mr fisher  thank you  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not we are ready for our economic go
round  for president evanss benefit we do have twohanded interventions as a possibility  its
like the discount windowrarely used but there if you need it
mr kohn  is there a stigma mr chairman  laughter
chairman bernanke  theres no stigma  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  as far as where conditions are today ill keep
my remarks short since they dont differ a great deal from the greenbook part 2 and the remarks of
others  on the district itself our district continues to do economically well  energy obviously is a
strong factor  for agriculture we have even adjusted the earnings numbers up dramatically since
february  manufacturing has shown strength in august and services seem to be good  the surveys
were doing also suggest those are continuing to do reasonably well  my outlook in terms of what
the reaction is or what were seeing in the economy for the national economy is not unlike that
except that the data are more mixed as described by others  so i wont go into that
the issue is not so much where we are  its where were going to be six and nine months
from now and the issues around that are issues of uncertainty  banking conditions in our region
and i think more broadly are good  the issues there as we will talk about later are issues of
balance sheets liquidity and such things which are important considerations to the economy going
forward  that will be an important discussion  as we survey our businesses looking forward we
see the effects of some of the uncertainty where people in a broad crosssection are saying that
they have not pulled back on their capital spending or in their hiring plans generally but are in a
little more of a waitandsee mode  so there is a tendency to want to hold back and the effects of
that are really up in the air  i think thats important for us to consider  also we have seen backing
off from funding commitments that were there  just like others were seeing that as well in our
region  as a result looking forward we have reduced our outlook but not anywhere near as
dramatically as the greenbook  i think that we will get through this transition and that the economy
has enough momentum that it will go forward if confidence hasnt been lost  so i dont have quite
as pessimistic an outlook going forward
the other element is the inflation outlook and i think that inflation should remain relatively
modest  the thing that struck me is that the real rate has increased as inflation has come down over
the past year since we last held and so real rates are actually tighter  that should have a favorable
effect on the inflation outlook and also its own slowing effect in the economy and i think that will
be a very important part of our discussion going forward  with that ill just stop for the time being
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman with regard to our district we continue to grow
apparently faster than the rest of the country  there are signs of overbuilding particularly in the
multiresidential and some commercial sector areas  i will give you one data point that focuses the
mind and then id like to go on to a broader discussion  in the city of austin texas between 2000
and 2007 fifty condominium units priced at 1 million or more came on the market  over that
sevenyear period forty of them sold  there are now more than 560 coming onto the market  we
have seen a significant boom in construction in all the major cities of our district and that does give
me pause  nonetheless we continue to speed along driven not so much by energy as by medicine
and the service sector  so i continue to expect that we will outpace the rest of the country  we are
seeing some decline in terms of advanced airline bookings as they affect our district but theyre not
that different from the rest of the united states
what id like to address is the broader issue  mr chairman i am a little confused as to why
we are talking about the economic situation and then skipping a beat before we talk about the
proposed discount window facility  i do see the two going hand in hand  id like to suggest that
were navigating a very narrow passage here in something of a fog  david i think was honest
about that  on the one side is a serious risk of overcompensating in our navigational course and
incurring a moral hazard or overcompensating for what is a perceived risk in uncharted waters  on
the other side i think we run the risk of biting off our employment growth responsibility to save our
inflationfighting face  so on the starboard shore we hear a siren called very large financial
institutions which infer that a reduction in the fed funds rate will rescue them from peril however
selfinflicted that peril may have been and despite the fact that theyre well capitalized according to
the reports that we have put together  on the other shore we are relying on navigational charts or
uncertain landmarks oras you said davidrudimentary tools that are giving us mixed readings
im going to argue today that we should ease by 25 basis points mr chairmanim just showing
my hand earlyand indicate through our words that we might tilt the rudder a bit further if needed
further i am going to argue that we should defer discussion of the new discount window and we
can get to that later  my concern is that if we fail to ease we risk steering into a recession but if we
shift the tiller too radically on the fed funds side i believe that we risk tacking onto that siren call
that i mentioned earlier and that we will indulge rather than discipline risky financial behavior
what im about to talk about i base on a rather indepth sounding just to kill the naval
analogy once and for all in this discussion  laughter  i sent you and the vice chairman a list of
the people i consulted  it is also based on what were hearing from our economists in the district
and in our bank and very importantly on what the greenbook and the bluebook have said  there
is no question that our contacts report a slowing in the pace that occurs through the third quarter
and they do detect a pulling in of the horns in terms of cost controls budgetary planning and us
capital expenditures as opposed to foreign capex which theyre still planning to expand
significantlyall in light of the press given to the subprime debacle financial turmoil and just a
general sense of caution
however there are some very bright spots and im going to go through these at a bit of
length because i think theyre important to recognize  att for example a local but significant
company says weve had the best quarter weve had on the consumer side and on the business
side its the hottest august in history  their average revenue per user has risen for the past two
quarters after declining for the past two and a quarter years  texas instruments an international
company reports continued growth on the consumer side robust industrial growthim quoting
their cfoand strong industrial demand and is struggling to meet demand  just to go to the
other extreme brinker international is a middleincome restaurant chain that employs 120000 and
operates throughout the country  other than weakness in southern california and florida traffic
increases in july and august seasonally adjusted were the best in twelve months  walmart
reports according to their ceo for us operations that august was a perfect retail month
theyre experiencing no problems with suppliers and no shortage of supply inventory  they are
feeling cost pressures from china which ill turn to in just a minute  disney reports record
attendance in their theme parks very high advanced bookings through next spring and very strong
broadcasting revenues  we are hearing the same from the other broadcasters and companies like
timewarner and needless to say exxon is a happy place right now  the law firms that we have
begun to survey rather thoroughly reminding ourselves that there are more lawyers than there are
auto workers in america are experiencing a boom in business  in short if you take the summary
offered by the ceo of  timewarner who also sits on a significant bank board as many people
know he says i see softness but not precipitous change whereas the bank board i sit on keeps
yelling incoming  from a real main street perspective he said that the changes are marginal
now to be sure there are some weaknesses being reported  the one utility i talked to at
length is txu  the housing market has left a bit of a slowdown in demand  hookups by big
industrials howeversteel aluminum et ceteraare running very good loads according to their
ceo  ups reports that the package line has been flat to slightly up with a pickup occurring in july
and august  the volume declined 02 percent in the first and second quarters yet thats against a
gee whiz first quarter of 2006  july and august have picked up 08 percent  according to their
cfo we have not seen an impact from the credit crunch  the ceo of mastercard reports a
softening but nothing falling off the cliff  then jcpenney which is a middlethird retailer sees
retrenchment in discretionary spending the socalled appointment shopping  their backtoschool
season was one of the strongest they have seen recently  if you dissect say ciscos and edss
data you see a significant cutback in it expenditures by financial institutions which you would
expectwhat they call the big box financial houses citi morgan et ceteraand yet according
to john chambers rock solid growth in commercial and serviceprovider categories  in summary
underlying economic growth from the standpoint of anecdotal evidence from the contacts ive
talked to is stronger than it would appear from the press or from most prognosticators  i think
thats one important point to take into consideration
it is also very important mr chairman to think of how people react to what theyre seeing
theres no doubt an effort if youre worried about the future to tighten up on cost of goods sold
and to reduce your head count  yet everybody is complaining that theres a massive shortage of
labor in every one of the companies i spoke of but one  the other thing is that you change your
strategic approach  one relief thats been provided here is that the private equity firms have been
taken out so that bids of say seventeen times ebitda which is an actual case with no due
diligence are no longer the case  four of the companies i spoke with are now able to make strategic
acquisitions and they plan to proceed  the point is that the economy is not grinding to a halt  i
wont mention lawyers again in this discussion except here but see how theyre being hired now
akin gump very large firmsthey are working on strategic acquisitions and you can see a ramp
up in the volume thats occurring there  so i think thats an important thing to consider
another very important point to consider is that price pressures have not disappeared  i
believe they are being maintained by global demand  im going to give you just a couple of
reference points and then ill stop  as you know i like to quote the panamax shipping rates  when
we last met the spot daily rate for a panamax shipagain the dry bulk carrierswas 59000 a
day  yesterday it was 70000  port utilization is running at a record high  why  asian demand
after ten years of deflation the major retail sources from china according to walmart and other
interlocutors report cost increases running at 2 to 4 percent  after ten years of deflation theyre
now inflating slightly  although i said i wouldnt mention lawyers but just so you know for the
first time in history in los angeles new york and dallas all beginning lawyers start at 160000
i think they are raising it to 180000 in all markets  sara leefrom an agflation standpoint i
think this is important and i think we have to be aware of the public perceptionjust announced a
5 percent increase in the cost of bread and they announced that they may hike another 5 percent at
the end of the month  the spread between wheat and corn mr chairman is the widest it has
been  it is usually 200 to 250 it is now 600  cooking oil prices milk priceseven the
italians went on a oneday strike to protest the price of pasta  it wasnt successful but thats what
they did  the firms respond by weighting out the increased prices by putting less in the package
here in the united states  i want to mention again that were hearing widespread reports of labor
shortages and i do worry dave that it somehow just doesnt square  i think your report certainly
was elucidating but it does have implications for how fast consumption can fall off if indeed were
suffering from a labor shortage  finally there are price pressures that ensue from the booming
construction markets in china  chinese demand for skilled labor last year year over year was up
100 percent  theyre building a huge shipbuilding market and so on
so mr chairman i am concerned first that while we have made progress by any
measurement including our beloved trimmed mean measure of the pce in dallas that were just
beginning to make such progress and that there are risks out there and we need to acknowledge
them  they stem largely from global demand  second im very concerned that were leaning the
tiller too far to the side to compensate risktakers when we should be disciplining them  so im
going to conclude not with a sailing analogy but with a football analogy  i dont think its time to
throw a hail mary pass  i think its time just to continue to move up the field running the ball as
weve been doing and i would strongly recommend a rate cut of only 25 basis points and no more
if indeed we accompany it with a change in the primary credit facility then i think we have to have
a very serious discussion of how far were willing to go on the fed funds rate  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  the news about the italian strike is concerning
me considerably  laughter
mr fisher  it didnt work
chairman bernanke  president fisher you raised a legitimate issue which i think i
should address now  we will this afternoon be discussing this auction credit facility with a possible
swap that would allow the europeans to provide term dollar funding as well  this work has been
going on for a few weeks  it has been very intensive  the staff has done a great job but as you
know and as bill explained the financial market conditions have improved somewhat in the past
few days and so we view iti view it and i think the board views it nowas a relatively close call
as to whether such a facility is needed at this juncture  what i would propose to do is discuss it as
planned on the agenda  we would like to have a thorough discussion and if the committee
approves the contingent permission to use it should market conditions appear in our judgment to
warrant it  but just because as you point out there is some interaction with the monetary policy
decision id just like to say that at this point it is not by any means a certainty that we will go
ahead and apply that particular agency
mr fisher  well thank you mr chairman  i look forward to that discussion  i didnt
know that  if they are indeed tied together then i would be making a very strong argument against
a 50 basis point cut if it were tied at the same time to this facility  so thank you very much for that
clarity
chairman bernanke  sure  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  on balance the data and the anecdotal
evidence in our district say that the economy continues to expand and advance moderately but the
pace may have slowed somewhat since june  readings of our business outlook survey of regional
manufacturing have been very volatile this summer  you may recall that in june our activity index
rose to 18 which was its highest value since april 2005  the index fell to 9 in july and to 0 in
august  the september survey conducted during the first two weeks of september remains
confidential and will not be announced to the public until this thursday at noonso these are really
new data  in fact we finalized it only yesterday  it indicates some recovery in general activity new
orders and shipments  the general activity index rose from 0 to 109  new orders and shipments
indexes also improved  another piece of good news from the manufacturers capital spending plans
is that they remain positive with the index at a level typically seen during expansions  plans to
increase capital spending were common among nearly all the major manufacturing sectors covered
by our survey  consistent with this our respondents generally see improvements in their business
activity coming over the next six months  in september we asked a special question about whether
the recent changes in the construction and financial sectors had any adverse effects on their business
or their business plans  about twothirds of the respondents said there was no impact on their
orders or shipments  about 11 percent reported a substantial decline  most of these firms were
housingrelated industries  one was in auto parts and one was in apparel  similarly threequarters
of the respondents had no change in their capital spending plans and only about 9 percent expected
to cut back substantially on their capital spending relative to plan over the rest of the year  my
reading of this is that the manufacturing sector in the region is holding up pretty well
in contrast residential construction activity in the region continues to deteriorate and we are
expecting to see declines in house prices  earlier these declines were seen only at the jersey shore
but now they seem to have spread a little more widely in the district  interestingly enough
homebuilders reported reducing prices to stimulate sales but with relatively little success  several
contacts told us that they were more concerned about the negative effects on buyer psychology of
recent financial market developments than they were about the availability of mortgage financing
that our region has been largely less dependent on subprime lending than some other areas may be
part of the reason for that  nevertheless none of our contacts in the real estate industry were willing
to forecast when the demand for housing was going to pick up  nonresidential construction has also
softened somewhat in our region as indicated by the value of contracts but thats a very volatile
number  these data tend to be revised up but the decline still is quite pronounced and it bears
watching  at the same time vacancy rates remain very low in the philadelphia area and so the
demand seems to be there but the contracts are down for the moment
employment growth over the threestate region ending in july remains below trend in new
jersey and delaware and kind of flat in pennsylvania  some firms continue to support what has
already been saiddifficulty in finding qualified workers  one of our board members runs a
temporary employment agency that goes through tens of thousands of people every month  she
said that there has been an uptick in walkin traffic of people applying for employment particularly
skilled workers but in fact there has been no falloff whatsoever in the demand from firms looking
for these people  so she has seen no decline in demand for these workers but she has seen a little
uptick in the supply coming through their office  our threestate unemployment rate remains
relatively low and below that of the nation  nonetheless july unemployment rates in our three
states were a little higher than we saw earlier in this year
the inflation picture for the district has changed little since our last meeting  wage
increases have been moderate  several firms report large increases in benefit costs but not an
acceleration of those benefit costs  the prices of industrial goods are increasing but retail price
increases havent been as widespread as they were earlier  in summary our regions inflation has
not accelerated  it hasnt decelerated either
economic activity in the third district continues to expand but its pace has perhaps slowed
somewhat  our business contacts generally expect activity to remain slow but on an upward trend
and are more uncertain about the outlook than they were but their plans seem to be in place  one
board member spent a great deal of time talking to a number of ceos and cfos about capital
spending plans and it was funny  he said that they said well everybody thought there was going
to be a capital spending program reduction  they werent planning a reduction but they knew
somebody else who was  it was very hard to find the person who was actually doing it but
everybody thought that someone else was doing it  so it was a little anecdotal
the national economy looks more vulnerable to me than it did six weeks ago but it would
be a mistakeand i think dave stockton did an excellent job of reminding usto count out the
resiliency of the us economy at this early stage  i think there can be a tendency in the midst of
financial disruptions uncertainty and volatility to overestimate the amount of spillover that they
will exert on the broader economy  for example the rate cuts after the stock market crash in 1987
were reversed fairly quickly  unfortunately we have very little hard data as yet to help us gauge the
potential size or persistence of the impact on real activity of the august turmoil and early signs may
be fraught with noise and overreaction to headlines  so i think we have to be very careful
of course it is possible that disruptions will further restrain the already weak housing
market by reducing the supply of mortgage credit  nonconforming mortgage rates even to prime
borrowers remain elevated but conforming rates to prime borrowers are actually lower right now
reduced lending in the alta and subprime market is not a surprise  it has been difficult to obtain
those loans since the early part of this year and i think that is not a big change  the biggest
surprise at least for me is that the impact on the obtainability of mortgages to homebuyers of the
recent disruptions has been in the area of nonconforming jumbo mortgages  yet the availability of
these mortgages and their rates are likely to settle back down more quickly to normal levels since
most of the people borrowing at the jumbo rates tend to be closer to prime borrowers than to
subprime  however as banks take some action to bring some of these risky assets back onto their
balance sheets we may look forward to further restraints on credit because they dont want to push
their capital ratios any harder than they have and so that may have a diminishing effect  but putting
aside any financial market effects signs of stabilization in the housing markets that we saw early
this year just have not been sustained as we all know  home prices have decelerated and have been
falling in certain localities and thats likely to continue  incoming data suggest that the downturn in
housing may be both more prolonged and somewhat deeper than certainly i had earlier anticipated
the question has been whether this decrease in housing wealth would spill over into consumer
spending regardless of the source of the decrease in housing wealth  the argument has been that
the strength in the labor markets and the stock market gains would continue and continued personal
income growth would buoy the consumer and mitigate those declines  i remind everybody that
even though the market is down heavily in august it is still up roughly 5 percent for the year  so it
wouldnt be a tank unless something further happened
august nonfarm payroll surprisingly fell by 4000 jobs in august as we know  i wouldnt
be too surprised to see this number revised up  loss of government jobs concentrated in local
education took a very big hit and this might be overstating the seasonal adjustment factors that are
going into this in the timing of the starts of the school year  still there was weaker private payroll
growth  theres no question about that and the revisions done in june and july were down
substantially  thus nonfarm payroll gains have averaged about 44000 over the past three months
whereas private payrolls have been a little more than 70000 for the past three months and thats
weaker than weve seen during the rest of the year  theres no question about that
on the positive side business spending remains fairly solid but our hard data are somewhat
stale and may be a little sketchy  although not in the data yet theres some risk of temporary
weaknesses in business fixed investment going forward simply because of the increased uncertainty
inherent in financial market disruptions  so far most of the firms weve talked to as i said earlier
say that their capital spending plans remain in place and only a few nonmanufacturing firms have
mentioned not canceling but just delaying them until the market has settled down  risk premiums
have increased from abnormally low levels which is probably beneficial  this has raised the cost
of capital for some firms but for most firms financing for capital spending remains available
many banks say that they have lending available and that they will lend to good customers  theres
not a problem  indeed most capital expenditures by businesses in fact are internally financed and
so the turmoil in the credit markets may not have as much spillover on capital spending as we might
otherwise expect  so unless theres a sharp decline in business sentiment which could occur if the
financial market turbulence worsens i dont expect to see that much of a pullback in business
investment spending except possibly in the very very near term
on balance i believe that within the forecast period we can see a return to trend growth
which i still estimate at about 2 percent somewhat higher than the greenbook  i still think thats
the most likely outcome but i now expect that return to be delayed by a couple of quarters given
housing and it wont be under way until certainly late in 2008  i admit theres still considerable
uncertainty surrounding that forecast and i certainly see that theres a possibility of particularly bad
outcomes some of which the greenbook scenarios have laid out  i also expect that some of the
indicators we receive over the next few months are likely to be weak but not necessarily weaker
than many of us have already built into our new forecasts  indeed because of the financial markets
disruptions the august data wont be particularly helpful or useful in reading the trends in the
economy
i think its going to be crucially important for us to convey to the public that we are forward
looking that we expect to see somewhat weaker data coming in but that they may not necessitate a
further change either in our forecast or in our policy  only when we accumulate sufficient new
information that causes our forecast to deviate from our already lowered projections do we want to
revise our forecast and perhaps our policy  i think this is a point that we need to make very clearly
to the public if not in our statement which we should try then in the minutes and in our speeches
as we go out  i think it would be detrimental to our cause and to good policy if the public expected
us to react to each piece of incoming data
on the inflation side i see that recent readings on core inflation have moderated  headline
inflation remains quite elevated  i dont think that we can afford to be sanguine  i continue to see
underlying inflation pressures as has already been articulated  longrange inflation expectations
have been stable but im concerned as we go forward with potential rate cuts  im concerned about
their remaining stable particularly when we may be lowering rates without being clear about what
our inflation goals are  indeed i think the current situation clearly shows the benefit of having an
explicit inflation goal  by anchoring those expectations an explicit goal would mean less of a
tradeoff between our two goals and so might make this policy decision easier and even perhaps
more effective  thus while my forecast has built in some nearterm policy easing partly to offset
the anticipation of tighter credit conditions i believe that we might find ourselves in a position
sometime during 08 in response to rising inflation of having to raise the fed funds rate back up  we
need to be particularly careful now with our communications regarding any policy action we take
but ill save that discussion for the policy goround  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  readings on core inflation during the
intermeeting period have continued to be encouraging and the downward trend has persisted long
enough that ive lowered my inflation forecast slightly  with the weaker outlook for growth i also
see less upside inflation risk emanating from cyclical pressures  with respect to economic activity
ive downgraded my forecast for growth in the fourth quarter by about the same amount as
greenbook and lowered it only marginally a bit less than greenbook in 2008  the downside risks
to this forecast are substantial and worrisome  the downward revision to my forecast reflects three
factors  first incoming data bearing on the outlook second my assessment of the likely impact of
the financial shock thats been unfolding since midjuly third the offsetting effect of the policy
changes i consider appropriate in response to the first two forces  my forecast assumes that the fed
funds rate will fall to about 4 percent in the fourth quarter  in other words my forecast is
premised on timely actions by the committee to mitigate much of the potential damage
let me begin by commenting on the economic data that we have received since early
august  some has certainly been positive  growth in the second quarter was revised upward
suggesting more momentum heading into the current quarter and most indicators of consumer
spending and business fixed investment were also robust  like most observers ive concluded that
these data taken together support a small upward revision in my estimate of thirdquarter growth
however recent data on housing and forwardlooking indicators relating to this sector suggest even
greater weakness in residential investment than we previously anticipated  manufacturing activity
recently turned down and importantly to me the august employment report showed a marked
deceleration in payroll employment growth over the past three months suggesting that the financial
shock hit an economy possessing quite a bit less momentum than i had factored into my previous
forecast  moreover survey measures of consumer confidence are down and these results probably
do incorporate early effects from the recent financial shock
of course the most important factor shaping the forecast for the fourth quarter and beyond
is the earthquake that began roiling financial markets in midjuly  our contacts located at the
epicenterthose for example in the private equity and mortgage marketsreport utter
devastation  anecdotal reports from those nearbyfor example our contacts in banking housing
construction and housingrelated businessessuggest significant damage from the temblor  for
example a large furniture retailer with stores in utah and nevada has seen sales fall off and he has
tightened credit terms for his customers and has already frozen his hiring and investment plans  in
contrast our business contacts operating further from the epicenter appear remarkably unfazed
luckily for them and for us the financial quake has thus far produced at most minor tremors in their
businesses  this is not surprising  it is still too early to expect the ripple effects to be noticed by our
contacts or to show up in the spending data
we could take a waitandsee approach to the financial shock incorporating its impact on
our growth forecasts only after we observe its imprint in the spending data  but such an approach
would be misguided and fraught with hazard because it would deprive us of the opportunity to act in
time to forestall the likely damage  this means we must do our best to assess the likely effect of the
shock  the simplest approach is to rely on our usual forecasting models  however as david
emphasized in his remarks the shock has not affected to any great extent the financial variables that
are typically included in our macro models  since we last met there have been only small net
changes in broad equity indexes and the dollar  of course risk spreads in credit markets are up
across a broad range of instruments and for most borrowers both corporate and households  but
there has been an offsetting drop in treasury rates so that key rates appearing in our modelsthe
interest rate on conforming mortgages and the interest rate facing prime corporate borrowersare
little changed or even slightly lower  it is riskier corporate borrowers and households seeking
nonconforming mortgage loans including jumbos that have seen their borrowing rates rise over the
past few months  but importantly it is the drop in treasury yields about 50 to 100 basis points
since early july that has thus far shielded so many borrowers from higher interest rates and of
course this drop reflects the markets expectations that the committee will ease the stance of
monetary policy rather substantially  as i noted my forecast assumes that we will plan to ease by
around 75 basis points by yearend in line with market expectations  even under this assumption i
see movements in interest rates alone as adding to a modest tightening of financial conditions
but of course an evaluation of the likely economic impact from the financial shock must
also take into account changes in credit availability and lending terms even though these variables
rarely appear explicitly in forecasting models  it is apparent that the availability of lending of some
types including subprime and alta mortgages has diminished substantially or disappeared
entirely  moreover banks and other financial institutions are imposing tighter terms and conditions
across a broad range of corporate and household lending programs  for example fico cutoffs
have been raised and maximum loantovalue ratios lowered in many mortgage programs according
to our contacts  in part these changes reflect the pressures that banks and other financial
intermediaries are experiencing in the context of severe illiquidity in secondary markets for
nonconforming mortgages and other assetbacked securities assetbacked commercial paper and
term loans in the interbank market
many of the liquidity problems now afflicting banks and other financial market participants
will presumably be resolved at least eventually but its hard to believe that markets will return to
business as usual as defined by conditions in the first half of this year even after that occurs  for
one thing many of the structured credit products that became so widely used may prove to be too
complex to be viable going forward and this would more or less permanently reduce the quantity of
credit available to many risky borrowers  moreover if the financial intermediation that was
routinely conducted via asset securitization and offbalancesheet financing vehicles ultimately
migrates back onto the books of the banks borrowing spreads and lending terms are likely to
remain tighter given current limitations on bank capital and the higher costs of conducting
intermediation through the banking sector  most important the recent widening of spreads appears
to reflect a return to morerealistic pricing of risk throughout the economy this development may be
positive for the long run but it will be contractionary in the short run
similar to the greenbook weve incorporated these financial developments into our
projection by revising down our forecast for residential construction and home prices  but as we all
know housing is a small sector so a major question is to what extent the financial shock will spread
to other parts of the economy  we see a large drop in house prices as quite likely to adversely affect
consumption spending over time through a number of different channels including wealth effects
collateral effects and negative effects on spending through the interest rate resets  a big worry is
that a significant drop in house prices might occur in the context of job losses and this could lead to
a vicious spiral of foreclosures further weakness in housing markets and further reductions in
consumer spending  several alternative simulations in the greenbook illustrate some of the
unpleasant scenarios that could develop  a final concern is that the uncertainty associated with
turbulent financial markets could make households and businesses more cautious about spending
causing some investment plans to be put on hold and some planned purchases of houses and
consumer durables to be deferred  so at this point i am concerned that the potential effects of the
developing credit crunch could be substantial  i recognize that theres a tremendous amount of
uncertainty around any estimate  but i see the skew in the distribution to be primarily to the
downside reflecting possible adverse spillovers from housing to consumption and business
investment
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  most of the economic data we have for
this meeting reflect the economy before the liquidity issues in august  the employment report
while probably not wholly reflective of the problems and affected by some anomalous seasonals
nonetheless provides evidence that labor markets were slowing at the outset of the financial
problems  given the layoffs that are being announced by financial services firms and the
potential for continued difficulties in construction some further easing of labor markets seems
quite likely  although we do not have housing starts and permits for august the outlook for the
second half of 2007 is likely to deteriorate further than forecasters had predicted before the
liquidity issues  there is good reason to believe the staff forecast that residential investment will
remain weak well into 2008  stock prices of all the major homebuilders have continued to
decline since our last meeting and the credit derivative swaps for several of the largest
homebuilders are at levels that reflect a very high probability of default
the news from the financial markets has improved marginally from the last meeting but
i still have some significant concerns  certainly some of the financial anomalies have abated
such as the extremely low rates for shortterm treasury securities and there are some tentative
signs of improving liquidity  however these improvements are tenuous and the ability to raise
funds in a number of shortterm financial markets remains quite difficult  i would just highlight
a few of the financial anomalies that are reflective of the situation  usually the overnight
eurodollar trades very close to the overnight fed funds rate  both are overnight dollar loans
between financial institutions on an unsecured basis  over the past month the funds for
overnight eurodollars have frequently been trading much higher than overnight fed funds  this
highlights the difficulty that some european financial institutions are having borrowing in dollars
and the unwillingness of many financial institutions to arbitrage these spreads if they involve
credit exposures to european financial institutions even for overnight  these difficulties worsen
when the maturities extend out to one to three months  both the onemonth and threemonth
libor rates have remained very elevated particularly given that the fed funds futures during
this period have indicated a market expectation of falling federal funds rates over the next three
months  the elevated libor rate tightens credit for a variety of domestic borrowers and could
affect areas that are already troubled  for example many subprime mortgages are tied to the
libor rate as are many loans that have been used to finance leveraged buyouts
a second example is the significant swelling of bank assets in august  the monthly
growth rate for bank ci loans was 26 percent and for other loans and leases was 63 percent
these are among the largest monthly increases in thirty years  as in other periods of liquidity
strain bank balance sheets become particularly important  as banks honor loan commitments
and agreements to provide liquidity support their balance sheets grow  my concern is that bank
obligations will continue to expand bank balance sheets in september and crowd out other
investment opportunities
many financial market participants are very concerned about the next two weeks despite
some recent easing of conditions  some investors are not willing to lend except overnight  the
assetbacked commercial paper market has remained under stress and the rollovers have been
for shorter maturities  there is significant concern that holders of commercial paper may be
reluctant to hold assetbacked commercial paper on their balance sheets at the end of this month
and rumors abound about whether money market funds and other shortterm investors will
continue to hold commercial paper for structured products particularly of the sivs
so we have a situation of a very weak housing sector some evidence of slowing
employment growth and a period of extended illiquidity that may get worse before it gets better
the tail risk of liquidity problems and economic problems has grown and we clearly want to
avoid outcomes by which declines in prices for houses and for financial assets tied to the housing
sector could create moresevere economic outcomes  the fact is that we do not have much
experience with periods of extended illiquidity especially when the housing sector is so weak
so taking out insurance against these risks seems entirely appropriate  the decision is made
easier in my view because i see the risk of unacceptably high inflation resulting from such an
action as being quite low  my hope is that with appropriate easing of policy the liquidity issues
will abate as we start the fourth quarter
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the reports that i am hearing from my
business contacts reflect a sudden and a significant deterioration in their evaluation of the
business climate  the data in hand except for the troubling august employment report have not
been especially dire and neither are the impressions i get from the business community
regarding their current pace of economic activity  in fact by most accounts business activity in
the fourth district outside of the residential real estate market remains reasonably positive and
the beige book report that we submitted for this meeting reflects that view  in most cases the
sharp downward reassessment of the business situation that i am now hearing from my contacts
describes greater unease over what may happen and not what has happened  as we discussed
earlier our forecast models are not well equipped to accommodate the role that shifting
expectations play in shaping the economic outlook  nevertheless the sharp falloff in business
confidence that i am hearing from people in many sectors in the district has had a material
influence on the economic projections that i submitted for this meeting
the market for real estate is still declining perhaps even in a freefall according to the
descriptions i have been getting from people across the sector including real estate
professionals developers and manufacturers of home construction supplies and materials  i
dont pretend to have a very confident forecast of where the bottom of the residential real estate
market lies but the industry sources that i am talking to have convinced me that we should
anticipate that this process will play itself out for a considerable time to come  moreover and
unlike my last report to the committee my business contacts are now fearful that we are going to
see a spillover from the declines in the residential real estate market and they now expect some
amount of retrenchment by consumers  i have incorporated some of that sentiment into my
outlook  the most noteworthy development affecting my economic projection however has
been the deterioration in business confidence and the effect that deterioration may have on
capital expansion plans  the diminished confidence in the outlook that business leaders are
reporting to me has had a significant negative effect on my outlook for investment  like the
greenbook i have scaled back my growth outlook to reflect a considerably softer trajectory for
business fixed investment  even with a monetary policy response the combination of weaker
consumer and business spending has led me to mark down my gdp projection for next year
nearly  percentage point to 2 percent
meanwhile the incoming inflation report continues to point to a gradual disinflation
the usual caveats about inflation forecasts apply of course but i am not seeing in the dataand
i am not hearing from my business contactsthe same concern over rising prices that i heard in
the spring  my outlook for inflation hasnt changed that much since july  i am still expecting
core pce inflation to be just under 2 percent  but i am more confident if just a little that we are
seeing the progress toward price stability that we had hoped to achieve
so i believe that the risks to the outlook given no change in our policy have shifted
decisively toward potential rapid deterioration in the real economy  some of that deterioration
may reflect the unwinding of earlier financial imbalances and every prudent effort should be
made to allow that process to run its course  but the moral hazard caveat does not diminish the
significance of the falloff in business sentiment that i have heard since our last meeting and so i
am concerned that we have seen greater risk to the economic outlook since our last meeting
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  in the sixth district we indulge
ourselves with the conceit that our district looks a lot like the nation as a whole  we have 45
million consumers and an industrial composition that does resemble the country so you can
process my regional remarks with that conceit in mind  housing markets continued to
deteriorate in august in the sixth district  housing market weakness was most pronounced in
florida as you might expect followed by atlanta and middle tennessee  the consensus view is
that the recent tightening in mortgage credit availability will exacerbate the regions housing
market problems and most regional contacts believe that housing markets will continue to
weaken bottoming out no earlier than mid2008 and some see a much longer adjustment period
aside from housing real economic readings in the sixth district were mixed  anecdotal
feedback across a number of industries suggested that business spending has not yet slowed
markedly but the majority of contacts indicated that they are now approaching new capital
spending more cautiously  that said most contacts acknowledge that tighter credit standards
have not significantly affected business capital investment outlays  reports of factory activity
were mixed with defense and export industries doing well while industries linked to housing
were predictably weak  transportation contacts indicated ongoing weak domestic demand
consumer activity in the district was flat to slightly up in august compared with a year ago
housingrelated home product sales were especially weak as were auto sales  perhaps the most
notable change from previous months was a turn to pessimism on the part of directors reflecting
their soundings of business contacts in their communities  i will mention that we have five
branches so we actually get director feedback from more than forty directors across the district
sixty percent believe that economic activity will be slower six months out twice the percentage
recorded in july  even factoring out idiosyncratic conditions in localities such as south florida
and the gulf coast the outlook based on these anecdotal reports has turned to the negative
to summarize my regional commentscurrent fundamentals are mixed and the outlook
is pessimistic  in our view the economic outlook has changed since the last meeting and the
balance of risk has clearly shifted to the downside  we do not see a nearterm recession as a
high likelihood but we do anticipate that growth will approach trend much more slowly with
employment edging up as a consequence  so in direction and tone if not magnitude we are in
agreement with the greenbook but our forecast differs from the greenbook baseline forecast in
the depth of the belowtrend growth ours being somewhat milder because we condition our
forecast on deeper cumulative cuts in the fed funds rate over the coming months
turning to capital markets my recent conversations with a number of capital market
participants suggest that the adjustment process in financial markets is far from complete  their
anecdotal feedback reflects a range of views about the severity of the current problems and the
outlook for stabilization  here is the overall picture i gleaned from these conversations  some
debt markets have firmed a bit  the leveragedloan market for example is likely to renew
trading in the coming weeks but structureddebt security markets are not yet clearing  the
principal reasonand this has been mentioned earlier by bill and othersthat debt markets
remain illiquid is weak counterparty transparency and therefore uncertain counterparty risk as
well as uncertainty regarding the performance of collateral pools that back securities  the
process of achieving adequate clarity and stabilization of the markets will likely take many more
weeks  markets will remain volatile while the condition of heightened uncertainty persists
there has been some spillover into markets that are unrelated to structured debt and subprime
but creditworthy borrowers are getting credit  there is sufficient buyer liquidity currently on the
sidelines awaiting greater clarity regarding counterparties market pricing of securities and the
depth and scope of the difficulties  widespread deleveraging particularly by sivs and hedge
funds and nonbank entities is occurring and is likely to continue
one party argued however that all the news of financial distress has not pushed risk
spreads to the extremes of historical bands  this party argued we are experiencing a painful
adjustment from excessively high leverage to morerational or morerealistic pricing in line with
historical averages  but all contacts believeand this is perhaps not unexpectedthat
prolonged credit market problems will affect the broad economy mostly through the consumer
credit channel
so i believe our decision today boils down to whether we cut  percentage point or
 percentage point obviously in combination with careful wording of the statement that conveys
a rationale focused on economic fundamentals while signaling some recognition that the
problems in the capital markets have the potential to deliver a credit shock to the broad economy
i consider it appropriate to adjust the federal funds rate to the nowweaker economic outlook
and i support a 50 basis point move with the rationale that at least 25 basis points of that
represents recognition of a lower equilibrium rate and the remainder is a preemptive preventive
measure designed to renew confidence facilitate conditions that resolve uncertainty and shorten
the necessary adjustment timeline in a deleveraging financial sector  it is a fair question whether
the process of information revelationthat is removing uncertaintywill be accelerated by an
aggressive rate cut  my view is that this action along with other liquidity actions removes the
psychological barrierthat being the concern that the fed might fail to ensure enough upfront
liquidity and might be pursuing an inadvertently tight policy compounding problems by putting
undue stress on the real economy  i think a distinction can be drawn between trying to influence
the psychology around dangerous financial sector circumstances and bailing out the markets and
care should be taken to reflect this in the minutes
let me add that i agree with the earlier comments of president fisher that we perhaps
should be looking at any policy move in the context of a total package that includes the auction
credit facility  so i do have lets say some sympathy for the view that the total package must be
discussed  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  recent information from the fifth district
both from contacts and from our survey responses suggests that growth in economic activity in
our district has slowed in recent weeks  the survey indicates that retail sales have weakened
with bigticket categories such as automobiles and building materials leading the way  shopper
traffic has trailed off somewhat as well  services firms report slower revenue growth and less
optimism about demand going forward
activity in some district housing markets has slowed markedly in the past two to three
weeks and some formerly healthy markets are now showing signs of weakness  one contact in
charlotte for example says that sales agents there are saying the same things they were saying
in atlanta several months ago  residential foreclosures are more widespread though they
appear to be concentrated or overrepresented among investors rather than owneroccupants
mortgage activity has fallen off in the past several weeks according to our contacts  while
standards have tightened for marginally qualified applicants it is reported that mortgages remain
readily available for creditworthy borrowers  the ceo of a nationwide title insurance company
reports that their open orders have been trending down in recent weeks  he also says that they
are seeing an increase in cancellations of title insurance orders because people are applying for
more than one mortgage in the current climate
in contrast commercial real estate conditions appear generally healthy although recent
reports suggest that closer scrutiny is being given to marginal project proposals  conditions in
manufacturing also look positive shipments and new orders continue to expand and hiring
indicators for this sector have edged higher  district price pressures remain at about the same
level they have been in recent months
let me say that broadly speaking across our contacts we have heard in the past week or
two more reports mentioning a sense of gloom  this echoes what presidents pianalto and
lockhart said  on the other hand one contact in charlotte who has had a lot of successful
experience in real estate markets said that compared with past crises this is a walk in the park
maybe that is just because he has made his  it may be particular to this situation so i dont want
to make too much of that
the national economic data that we have received since our last meeting point pretty
clearly to a weaker economic outlook for real growth  the employment report is a prominent
example  slower growth in the months ahead would weigh on income growth and consumption
although the greenbooks outlook for income remains pretty healthy  recent reports on housing
activity have also been quite disappointing  i think the key question is the effect on the housing
market and broader economic activity of the recent financial market turmoil  i wont survey
what has happened presidents yellen and rosengren and mr dudley did an excellent job on
that  i will just comment that it seems broadly speaking as if we are on a traverse from a
configuration of intermediation that placed a fairly heavy reliance on fairly complicated and
structured products and rating agencies assessments of those  it is a traverse that is obviously
going more rapidly and is fraught with more peril than the path that took us to the configuration
we are coming from  so it is hard to know how much of an effect this turmoil will have on
housing  i suspect that a lot of the slowdown was already in train before the middle of august  i
base that thought on the fact that many mortgage rates rose earlier in the summer than august
though the jumbo market is an obvious exception to that
beyond housing any projections of real effects from events in financial markets seem
like guesswork at this point  my sense is that while we may see some marginal slowing in
business investment the effects are likely to be small because i dont think the marginal cost of
funding for most businesses has gone up much and we arent hearing reports of wholesale
tightening of lending standards in the corporate sector  i havent heard that from around the
country either  i expect consumer spending to grow more slowly than in recent years but not too
dramatically so  i think that there is a fair amount of uncertainty about the size of the housing
wealth effect and that household net worth overall remains fairly high relative to income at this
point  as i noted earlier the greenbooks projection for disposable income isnt too bad so that
would support consumption growth at least at a moderate pace going forward  overall then i
come out a touch above the greenbook with real growth about 2 percent in the second half and
then gradually returning to trend  of course i have been expecting less of a slowdown than the
greenbook for about a year now  it turns out that although we have both been too optimistic
the greenbook has been closer to reality so my confidence in my forecasting ability is waning
here
the inflation numbers have been encouraging  core pce inflation averaged under
14 percent for the past five months and overall pce inflation was under 2 percent for both june
and july  i am particularly pleased that tips inflation compensation has not increased even as
market participants have marked down their expected funds rate path in the midst of the recent
turmoil  that said it still looks as though market participants expect inflation to settle near
2 percent rather than lower as i would prefer  that concludes my remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  to date economic conditions in the seventh
district have changed little since our last meeting  we continue to expand at a modest rate as
reported in the beige book two weeks ago  even after accounting for continuing declines in the
housing sector most of my contacts thought the national economy had softened  outside of
housing they generally reported a modest deceleration rather than an abrupt change in
conditions  retailers thought that continued high energy prices were holding back consumers
but demand was not seen as deteriorating sharply  a similar slowing was reported on the hiring
front  for instance kelly and manpower experienced softer demand for temporary workers but
again this was not characterized as a general pullback in hiring  many contacts added that
finding skilled workers remained difficult as president fisher mentioned
in terms of the business outlook going forward several directors and other contacts noted
that many in the business community were apprehensive about the prospects for growth  they
were concerned that these worries might soon begin to weigh more heavily on actual spending
for example in the motor vehicle sector both ford and general motors cautioned that the
august sales numbers overstated the underlying strength in demand for vehicles  they thought
some selective incentive programs had boosted the sales figures  i asked all my contacts about
the effects of the turmoil in credit markets  though it is still early none of them thought that the
recent financial turbulence was causing creditworthy nonfinancial firms to have unusual
difficulty in finding adequate financing  as several people have said many business people
suggested that the situation is much better than what they hear from financial commentators on
wall street  of course we heard many examples of difficulties from financial market contacts
and several have spoken about that already
turning to the national outlook three broad developments since our august meeting have
influenced my views on the economic situation  first financial conditions have become more
restrictive  second the incoming data suggest a greater decline in housing and a somewhat
weaker labor market  third inflation prospects have improved to the point where my outyear
projections are within a range that many participants would view as consistent with price
stability  these projections embed a path for the federal funds rate that is similar to the
greenbook assumption
with regard to financial conditions i think it is useful to consider the situation relative to
an assessment of a neutral or an equilibrium federal funds rate  taking into account the slower
growth of structural productivity a neutral rate is likely between 4 and 4 percent  the
greenbookconsistent rate is in this range  until recently one argument for keeping the target
funds rate at 5 percent had been to offset otherwise accommodative conditions  as recently as
june we had very low risk premiums and ample liquidity for all types of private borrowing
including large commitments for private equity deals  now of course overall financial
conditions have tightened and in some markets have turned very restrictive  clearly this
restrictiveness is a downside for growth  whether it is as large as  percentage point as the
greenbook assumes is uncertain  in any event the ongoing repricing of risk also adds a good
deal of uncertainty to the forecast  you all know it is very difficult to forecast the impact of such
financial turbulence  recent history and dave stockton remind us of this  in the early 1990s
restrictive credit due to depositories capital adequacy problems had a significant impact on real
economic activity  in contrast in the fall of 1998 we thought financial conditions would
impinge a good deal on the real economy but 1999 turned out to be a very strong year for
growth  bottom lineand we all recognize thiswe need to be careful how we react to the
current financial situation
turning more specifically to the outlook for growth our chicago forecasts have tended to
be somewhat more optimistic than the board staff forecast and we remain so  that said the
incoming data have been softer than we expected  so we marked down our assessment of
residential investment again but not as much as the board staff didagain and the decline in
payroll employment caused us to lower our nearterm outlook somewhat  as long as the
financial difficulties are contained and that is our working assumption we expect growth to
return to potential by the second half of 2008 and we have a higher potential output growth rate
than the board staff  however i admit that the risks seem weighted to the downside of this
projection
with regard to inflation the improvement in core pce inflation earlier this year appears
to have a bit more staying power than we thought it might  if aggregate demand does weaken as
expected then there is less risk of inflationary pressures arising from constraints on resource
utilization  energy prices though are a concern  my contacts do not seem to have much
difficulty passing cost increases through to their customers  overall however we have core
pce inflation edging down to 18 percent next year and remaining near that rate in 2009  i see
the risk to this inflation forecast conditioned on the outlook for growth as being fairly well
balanced  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  lets put president poole between us and the
coffee break  president poole  laughter  sorry
mr poole  after or before
chairman bernanke  before  go ahead
mr poole  oh before  okay  im going to be brief
mr mishkin  its a question of how desperate you are  laughter
mr poole  speak for yourself  i have just a few anecdotes here  my contact in the
trucking industry says that things are very very glum there  volume is down 11 percent year
over year  shipping rates are down 5 percent and this is very general in the trucking industry
we get the same story from the trucking side of fedex and ups  but the small package side of
fedex and ups is doing somewhat better  in fact the august and september numbers
september to date obviouslyare actually a little better than the july numbers  they have not
changed their outlook for the holiday season and so it is not a real buoyant outlook but they
havent changed it at all in response to the financial market upset  a contact in the fast food
industry had an interesting comment that actually came out of walmart  walmart is reporting
a very significant drop in money transfers to mexico  that is probably reflecting the number of
mexicans who work in the construction industry  a contact with a major software firm is really
completely different  they are seeing very buoyant revenues  they are seeing it sales running
above the gartner forecast  they track sales and the weekly salesthis is as of friday the week
before lastwere doing very well in fact they were accelerating  a comment about the
consumer market  a new release of software for an apparently popular game has very strong
preorders  business sector demand is uniformly strong across small medium and large
businesses  international demand is very strong  there were no bad pockets in this business at
all was the report that i received there
my summary view on the outlook is that if the financial market upset goes away or
settles down in a few weeks the outlook for next year is going to appear more or less as it did
last june before the financial market upset began with of course some major exceptions or
revisions  housing is unambiguously going to be weaker  the nonprime market is gone i
think for the foreseeable future  maybe some of the alta market would start to come back but
the subprime is gone for the foreseeable future and housingrelated goodsappliances and
furniturepresumably are going to reflect the housing weakness  if the market disruption
continues the fallout for the real economy will grow and it is very hard to know how that might
turn out  as you were discussing things like the surprises going on in the united kingdom
come along in a very unpredictable fashion with unpredictable results  i view the greenbook
forecast as reflecting a mean with a certain probability of a stronger outcome more like the one
we had in june perhaps and then of course a certain probability of a weaker outcome  our job
is to raise the probability of that stronger outcome without raising the probability of higher
inflation  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  sorry to have put you on the spot there  it is
1110  why dont we take a break until 1130  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me make a few comments about current
economic conditions and then talk a bit about the outlook  by way of overview i will say that i
largely agree with the greenbook both about the current quarter and about the nearterm
outlook in any event  the current quarter does look as though it is going to turn out to be
certainly respectable real growth of 2 percent or perhaps a bit more  the anecdotes from our
district that relate to the third quarter seem to be consistent with that  employment has been
sustained and if anything the reports of the scarcity of skilled labor have probably increased  in
fact some of our directors have speculated that perhaps the aggregate employment gains have
been restrained by that availability issue  the largest bank in our district and several others say
that based on what they are seeing consumer spending and consumer unsecured borrowing are
proceeding normally  repayments are proceeding normally and credit quality on the consumer
side is in good shape  the one exception to what i would describe as a generally positive picture
is what we are hearing in the nonresidential construction sector  i dont want to make too much
of this but i have a sense that it is significant  some of the large developers in the district have
reported that because of the change in financial conditions that has occurred in the past month or
two some projects are clearly being postponed  whether they will ultimately be cancelled
remains to be seen but there certainly have been some effects there
turning to the outlook i think that the outlook for real growth over the next several
quarters is less favorable than it was formerly  i admit that its a stretch to get there if we rely
on our familiar models to produce that result  nevertheless i take a cue from the comments i
made a moment ago about nonresidential construction  it looks as though that will be somewhat
slower than i earlier anticipated because of changing financial conditions  i would guess that we
would see the same thing in outlays for equipment and software so im expecting a less
favorable performance there  as far as the housing sector is concerned it seems to me that
given the inventory of unsold homes even if financial conditions improve and improve relatively
quickly housing is going to exert a depressing effect on the economy for quite some time to
come just because of the inventory overhang  more broadly the changes in the cost and
availability of credit that we see are likely to hamper the economic expansion for several
quarters  so i have marked down my forecast accordingly based on changes in the factors i
citednamely a somewhat less favorable outlook for nonresidential construction and ultimately
for spending on equipment and software prolonged weakness in the housing sector and a
somewhat less favorable outlook for consumer spending as a consequence of changes in credit
cost and credit availability
on the inflation front the incoming information is slightly more favorable than i had
earlier expected and so on margin i have adjusted my forecast there as well  i had been
expecting a diminution of core inflation as a consequence of the ebbing of transitory factors and
of a moderately restrictive monetary policy  it appears to me now that the decrease in underlying
inflation is occurring a little sooner than i had anticipated and i think this is obviously a positive
development from a number of perspectives one of which is that it is potentially significant as it
gives us a little more maneuvering room on the policy front if in fact it is sustained  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  in my view the balance of
risks has changed significantly over the past several weeks  although outside of housing we
dont see much evidence nationally of a significant softening of growth growth is likely to be
somewhat softer than we had expected and the downside risks to that lower path have increased
substantially  i think inflation risks have diminished somewhat but we have to remain attentive
to the familiar sources of continued upward pressure  financial conditions have tightened since
the august meeting even with the increase in the amount of easing priced into markets and
despite the moderation in the libor term spread to fed funds over the past few days conditions
in credit and funding markets remain very fragile  even under relatively optimistic assumptions
about how these developments in markets will unfold the process of adjustment will take some
time to work through the financial system and very protracted impairment to market functioning
would raise of course the possibility of even moreadverse outcomes on the real side of the
economy
these changes in my view justify a reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting
monetary policy has an important role to play in reducing the width of the adverse tail of the
range of potential outcomes for real activity  by reducing the probability of an extremely bad
outcome on the real side monetary policy can help mitigate some of the coordination problems
that are hampering financial market functioning and delaying the necessary repricing of risk that
needs to take place particularly in markets for term funding the interbank market and for
mortgagerelated products  the difficult and consequential judgment we face is about the
appropriate size of the monetary policy response to these changes in risks to the outlook  i
believe the arguments work in favor of doing more now rather than less  policy needs to provide
a convincing degree of insurance against a more adverse outcome
of course there are risks of erring on the side of doing too much now and let me just
address three of those risks  first a large move could add to concerns about the downside risks
to growth and about financial fragility rather than mitigating those concerns  my view however
is that doing too little now would risk exacerbating uncertainty about the macroeconomic
outlook and a gradualist tentative response would be more disconcerting than encouraging  the
risk of underdoing it now is that we will ultimately be forced to do more  a second risk is that a
large move now could add to uncertainty about future inflation outcomes  this is true
however i think various measures of changes to the inflation outlook suggest that risks to
inflation have moderated a bit and the markets are displaying a fair amount of confidence in
both our will and our ability to keep future inflation stable at reasonably low levels  acting in a
way that suggests that we believe our credibility is more fragile would be more disconcerting
than encouraging to the markets  the third risk is that a large move could reinforce concerns that
we are adding to the moral hazard in the financial system  this is i think an inevitable
necessary consequence of acting to provide insurance against an extremely negative outcome
but its not a good argument against doing what we think is justified by the balance of risks to
the outlook  in this context it is important to be careful in the way we talk publicly about moral
hazard regarding this balance  in our financial system there is a substantial amount of leverage
in institutions and vehicles that are subject to very acute liquidity risk and part of what you are
now seeing in europe in the united kingdom in particular are the effects on confidence of
finding the wrong balance frankly between concerns about moral hazard and the appropriate
role of the central bank in situations like this  i think the framework that the chairman laid out
in jackson hole explains exactly the right balance between what we cannot or should not try to
do and what is important to do with monetary policy
the process of adjustment and deleveraging that is under way in markets in asset prices
and risk premiums is necessary and we should not direct policy at interrupting or arresting that
process or at insulating investors or institutions from the consequences of the decisions that got
us to this point  our objective should be to help facilitate that process but to do so in a way that
reduces the chance that it will cause too much damage to the functioning of the core of the
financial system and to confidence because of the consequence of such a scenario for the real
economy  to get through this process bank balance sheets need to expand substantially and
were fortunate that they can expand and are now expanding very substantially  a range of
nonbank financial institutions and financing vehicles will have to be unwound and restructured
asset prices and risk premiums may have to move further as more deleveraging takes place and
assets are liquidated  some of the inevitable increase in macroeconomic uncertainty is priced
into expectations  investors will have to get more comfortable that they can make judgments
about how to value mortgagerelated and other assetbacked securities despite the loss of faith in
ratings  the process of differentiation among strong and weak institutions conduits financing
vehicles et cetera also has to continue  but as many of you said this process could take quite
some time and it will leave us with the risk of a fair amount of fragility in markets in the interim
let me end just by reminding you of what ill call the bernanke doctrine of credibility
that the chairman laid out at one of our previous meetings  credibility for a central banker is not
just about the confidence that we instill in markets that we will act to keep inflation stable and
low  it is also a function of our capacity to demonstrate that we have a sufficient feel for the
evolution of the economy and about confidence and that we will meet those inflation objectives
without excessive cost to real activity and confidence  part of that credibility is a feel for what is
happening in markets and a capacity to look forward and anticipate the potential implications
that those developments may have for the outlook  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  the repricing of risk and rechanneling of credit
flows under way i believe will exert restraint on spending especially in the near term but over
the longer run as well  a critical channel of contagion that came into play in the intermeeting
period was the involvement of the banks as providers of credit and liquidity backstops in the
abcp market  as a consequence uncertainties about real estate markets the performance of
nonprime mortgages and structuredcredit products came to rest as greater uncertainty about
bank exposures  the classic flight to safety under waythe desire to protect capital and
liquidityhas caused banks and those providing them credit to become more cautious  this has
resulted in greatly reduced funding in term markets spreading the constriction of credit
potentially well beyond the mortgage and leveragedloan markets we talked about in early
august
like so many around the table i feel that i can honestly say that the uncertainties around
the output forecast were indeed larger than usual this time  fortunately we dont have many
degrees of freedom to test hypotheses about the sorts of relationships that were talking about
here  i think we can expect effects on spending to be greatest in the short and intermediate
terms while markets are disrupted and while participants are struggling to find new ways of
intermediating credit that address the perceived shortcomings of the previous practices  in the
short run to preserve capital and liquidity while secondary markets are impaired banks have
tightened terms and standards for loans  you can see this directly in the rise in spreads in the
prime jumbo market but it must be true for other less easily observed credits as well  some
credits such as nonprime mortgages and leveraged loans just havent been available for a while
an already weak housing market has been most directly affected and construction sales
and prices will probably fall substantially further because of the reduced demand along with a
large overhang of unsold homes  consumption spending is also likely to be trimmed  tighter
terms for home equity lines of credit and second mortgages mean not only that housing wealth is
declining but also that it is probably less liquid and more expensive  to the extent that asset
backed security markets are affected and lenders have questions about consumer balance sheets
the cost of consumer credit could well rise also  household confidence has apparently been
affected by the adverse financial market news  investment spending may also be held down by
uncertainty by a sense that consumer demand will be growing less rapidly  i have been struck in
listening to presidents around the table report about their districts that the tone has shifted
noticeably toward less optimism slower growth and more caution on the part of our business
respondents  it has been one of those shifts that you hear every couple of years around the table
that are different from what might have been anticipated say from reading the beige book
there is also some tightening of credit conditions in the business sectorfor example for
commercial real estate credit as some have noted and for credit for belowinvestmentgrade
firms
as a consequence some downshift in gdp is highly likely over the next few quarters
and without policy action we would most likely end up with a substantially lower gdp a few
quarters out  indeed in the greenbook the output gap is noticeably wider at the end of 08
despite nearterm policy easing of 50 basis points  i also noted downside risk to my output
forecast  it seems to me that in this period when markets are adjusting those risks are most
skewed  the potential for adverse interactions seems large as nervous creditors assess the
implications of declines in house prices volatile earnings of commercial and investment banks
and setbacks in overall confidence  i think there is a nonnegligible risk that the constrictions in
credit availability would feed back on the economy and in turn feed back on credit supply  as
market participants are better able to distinguish and assess risk liquidity will be reestablished
in many markets  although we have seen some improvement in the past week or two markets
are still quite dysfunctional in many regards  like others i think it could take a while to
discover how to structure securitizations that have the requisite transparency and appropriate
principalagent incentives to restore investor confidence and to recalibrate the roles of securities
markets and banks  the process could be particularly drawn out in mortgage and related
markets which are likely to be affected for some time by uncertainties about the prices of houses
and about the performance of mortgages  moreover some effects of the recent turmoil will be
longer lasting  risk spreads in a great variety of markets are likely to be at higher more
realistic and moresustainable levels banks should be charging more for credit liquidity
backstops less leverage in the financial sector implies a need for return on the greater amount of
capital involved in intermediation including at banks and some credit conditions at any given
fed funds rate will be tighter one year from now than they were a few months ago
i have concentrated on problems for growth but the upside inflation risks have not
disappeared  unit labor costs have been rising  markups while still high have come in
affording a reduced cushion for absorbing labor costs  resource utilization remains high by
historical standards  import prices may prove problematic  although commodity prices may
level out as in the staff forecast foreign economies also are producing at high levels  pressures
on the costs of finished goods could increase especially if the dollar declines further  my
expectations for the most likely path for inflation have been revised just a tick lower given the
favorable incoming data and the lower path for economic activity relative to potential which will
increase competitive pressures in labor and product markets  for now given this outlook we
need to concentrate on the potential effects of the disruptions to financial markets on the real
economy when we consider policy in the next portion of this meeting  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  as governor kohn just suggested i think
financial market tumult is likely to be of sufficient duration to have a meaningful effect on the
real economy  the policies that well be considering later today are unlikely to be a panacea but
i think that is not a reason for us to avoid taking some smart and preemptive actions  the
recuperation of these financial market trends is positive but i wouldnt measure the recovery
period here in weeks or even the next couple of months  i suspect it is going to take longer
the moderate growth story that many of us have been telling and that is reflected in the
greenbook and has been for some time appears at best case to be even more moderate  the
downside risks and the possibility of some nonlinear events in these financial markets are higher
perhaps not as high as they might have seemed when we last met by videoconference but those
prospects are still very real  when we had the videoconference on august 16 there appeared to
be at that moment extremely poor market functioning necessitating our actions that day  i think
we rightly determined that there was a liquidity shock maybe even a liquidity crisis that was
affecting financial intermediaries and that our actions were necessary to stop the liquidity
symptoms from manifesting themselves as a credit crisis  to that end our work goes on today
the results from that action and the benefit of time seem to have stopped the bleeding and the
deterioration of financial market conditions has largely ceased  however although the
improvements at this point are quite encouraging i dont think they are yet convincing  let me
just spend a few moments on the distinct phases of what this financial market distress has looked
like and try to outline maybe even oversimplify where we are in that
phase 1 strikes me as liquidity replenishment by financial institutions and marketmakers
alike  during the past three to four weeks commercial banks investment banks asset managers
and other private pools of capital have had to reassess their liquidity needs their cash needs in
light of the tougher financial market conditions  today by and large they have more cash on
hand than they ever thought would be necessary or prudent  but that liquidity replenishment at
least for the median and stronger firms is somewhat complete as they evaluate what the risks are
of contingent liabilities coming on their balance sheets and as they reevaluate the stress tests and
the comments of the people and the risk managers who had been telling them that they were ripe
for financial distress  some degree of confidence has been broken over the past six weeks  i
wouldnt say it has been reestablished but i think that is probably one of the things in the post
sarbanesoxley era that are giving the decisionmakers at these financial institutions a little less
interest in diving back into these marketsthey learned that maybe what they had at their
disposal or what they thought they knew wasnt as certain as they had hoped  many of these
financial institutions during the past several weeks still thought that another leg down was
possiblethat strong financial institutions were continuing to ensure and would continue to
ensure even today against foursigma eventsand that the best way for them to lose their jobs
in this environment was to be short of liquidity  they are also very focused on what is
happening among their peers  they are very focused on their relative strength and they certainly
want to be the survivors if the situation gets dramatically worse  all of these are in some ways
ex post rationalizations for why many of these institutions didnt serve in the shockabsorber role
that we would have expected them to take quickly after market distresses had begun  i think they
are getting used to the new environment  they have long since forgotten the robust times and
the robust profits of the past five years and they are looking at their capital ratios and getting
some comfort from what their people are telling them  but when we look at these financial
institutions we are probably more prudent to judge them by their actions rather than what these
capital ratios would suggest  their actions are still not ebullient  their actions are still not
overly opportunistic
i said before that liquidity is confidence  well in times like this i might be wrong
liquidity is oxygen  they cant live without it and no price can compensate them during this
liquidity replenishment period for a lack of oxygen  i think o2 levels might now finally be
returning so that they can enter phase 2 of this process when they are able and willing to part
with their cash  phase 2 thus is about finding new marketclearing valuations being able to
discriminate among differentiated assets and being able to put opportunistic capital to work
admittedly id say this valuation phase is less advanced than the liquidity phase but the process
of price discovery is slowly but surely working its way through these asset classes  highyield
bonds are one example  chrysler priced highyield bonds at 95  a couple of days later they
were trading at 99  other sorts of leveraged loans and highyield financing have indicative
prices in the mid90s but there are very big pipelines as we have discussed before that could
take a while to clear  my best guess is that we wont see those markets clearing until after the
commercial banks announce their thirdquarter results  so in midoctober we might see a new
estimate of that but i will admit its very hard to say  the pricediscovery process around
subprime mortgages is less advanced but even there we are seeing trading desks asking the
executives on the top floor for balance sheet capital because they see great prices for which they
just need the balance sheet  that those discussions have begun and are somewhat more
advanced than when we last talked is an encouraging sign but the process of adjustment to the
new market realities will take time  bill dudley spoke in great detail about other important
developmentsdiscrimination among assetbacked commercial paper programs being made
depending on sponsor and collateral financial institutions and the counterparty risk they
represent being differentiated and commercial banks more so today than even some weeks ago
willing to invest in jumbo prime mortgages in the expectation that the securitization markets will
reopen
it strikes me that we are substantially advanced in the liquidity phase and only somewhat
advanced in valuation  that would take us to the third phase  the third phase is about the cost
of capital  well talk about it more in the next round and optimally i would say that the liquidity
replenishment and valuation necessary would be far more advanced before monetary policy
actions would have to be put into place  but i think we bought ourselves some time and this
strikes me as the right moment for us to take monetary policy actions  the good news is that we
have seen some tentative progress in those first two phases and well talk more about our actions
to come
let me just highlight a few more issues  what are the key challenges  what are the
things to which we might want to look to see if the situation continues to improve modestly or
reverses itself  i would look at a few things  first as you look at some of these siv structures
and conduits particularly outside the mortgage assets to this point they are largely suffering
from a liquidity crisis rather than a credit crisis  that could change if the real economy falters
and that is an additional reason for us to take monetary action today  second many still believe
that its not safe to come out and play and they are continuing to hunker down  i would have
thought right when this started brewing in the middle of august that by now folks would have
been more comfortable but the median person is still more scared than i would have expected
third leverage is harder to come by  even on investments for which the credit work seems
pretty easy like high yield it is hard to get leverage alongside these equity placements making
folks less interested to jump back in a big way because the returns arent there  another
indicator id look to is the mediumterm note market which we havent discussed a great deal
but is really a sibling of some of these other commercial paper markets  they dont appear to be
too distressed at this time but as mentioned earlier i would also look at the mortgagebacked
securities around commercial real estate  the lack of term funding which well discuss when
we discuss the auction term facility has put financial market improvements at some risk  even
though we have been seeing real improvements in recent trading days the prospect that these
institutions are rolling over their funding and looking for funding every day strikes me as
significantly increasing the tail risk and suggests that we need to take action
finally on the real economy having spoken to a range of credit card companies
yesterday to try to get their sense of three things i can give i think generally positive reports
first as a measure of retail sales the view of institutions that cater to the high end the middle
end and the low end is that retail sales in august and through the first two weeks of september
were fine not great  but when i asked them the question if you werent aware of what was
happening in the financial markets and you were just to review these data does it look as though
something happened  does it look as though there was some exogenous shock to a person the
answer was no it looks as though things are coming along okay  i think thats reasonably
encouraging  second i asked them about the credit quality of consumer behavior whether
delinquencies for individual credit card behavior at the low medium or high end had changed
and the answer was that they really hadnt changed much  they can look and find yellow or red
flags but they said generally that consumer credit quality also looks fine  id say the biggest
caution from three or four of these credit card companies came on the corporate side
corporations wanting to be more protective being more risk averse during this period seemed to
have cut back on allowable expenses for things like airlines hotels conferences and the like so
their corporate credit volume had slowed up somewhatbut again nothing overly dramatic
last i would just share the uncertainty and hesitation that has probably crept its way back into
boardrooms generally as many of these companies outside the financial sector are trying to figure
out what the crystal ball looks like for the real economy  that hesitation is not useful and as i
said at the outset i think the best case is that we give up a couple of tenths of gdp  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  obviously i agree with virtually everyone
around the table that some of the downside risks have increased and its important to think about
them in terms not just of the overall average but of tail risks  as vice chairman geithner
pointed out one of the responsibilities we have overall is for thinking about macroeconomic and
financial stability and so we have to take into account those tail risks  even if they may not
change the mean or the median forecast that much it is important that we think about those
downside scenarios  obviously the chance of those has increased  now whether that is likely
is something we will continue to discuss  some of those channels through which this could be
happening are from the real sector in housing concerns about information in subprime markets
leading to broader problems in the markets  id like to characterize the markets as being brittle
that is they are in a state such that a little pressure here or a little pressure there has the potential
to cause some cracks  many markets are functioning but some are not functioning very well
and there is always the potential for something else to come along the line even just a small
amount of pressure  we saw that what really initiated things right after our fomc meeting was
bnp paribass announcement  that gets back to something that karen johnson said earlier in
one of these things  it was hard to know that it was coming and it would have been hard to
know that it would have the kind of effect that it seemed to have of leading to a revaluation of
risks not just in the subprime sector but much more broadly  so i think we have to be very
mindful of the brittleness of these markets
i do think that the numbers that have come in looking in the rearview mirror are pretty
strong  looking forward there is more uncertainty as dave and others have mentioned  we
obviously have the housing market problems and we have the challenges in the labor markets
to throw something in from an anecdotal survey although its a fairly systematic surveyat
duke they surveyed 600 cfos of major corporations and they asked a series of extra questions
the survey was done in august and so it was filled out by the end of august  we dont know
exactly when they filled these out but they had to be in by the end of august  asked about the
financial market turmoil threequarters of the cfos said that it had no direct effect on them but
only 40 percent said that they were taking no action because of the financial market turmoil  a
third of them said that they were going to be reducing capital spending and 15 percent said that
they were going to be reducing hiring  this is not just of the onequarter who said that there
would be direct impact but of everyone threequarters of whom said that there would be no
direct impact  but they said that they were reducing capital spending plans and hiring plans  so
this uncertainty could have real effects from these channels that we havent yet seen  also for
what its worth though i guess its more relevant for the next round one of the questions was
would you be helped by a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate  a resounding
45 percent said no  less than onethird said that it would be more than a moderate help to them
but thats something well get to in a bit
one thing that i want to doit has been important in my thinking and was also raised by
a few peopleis look at the parallels and differences with 1998 because that is the closest
episode that i can think of in which many of the same liquidity issues came up  a dramatic
widening of the ontherun offtherun treasury spread actually much larger in 1998 than we
have seen recently a plunge in shortterm yields and a very strong desire for shortterm
treasury paperexactly as we have seen in both cases although greater volatility in that short
term market today than in 1998 and higher volatility with respect to the equity markets today
than in 1998  spreads also moved upterm spreads swap spreads and cp spreads went up
quite dramatically although in certain types of cp spreads a little bit less back then than today
an interesting thing i noted in going back and looking at the old memos which were created i
think by some of the people who are in the room now was that one thing that brought the cp
market back in 199899 was not an innovation but the dramatically greater use of something that
had only just started to be usedassetbacked commercial paperproviding collateral that
helped people to feel confident that they could buy this commercial paper and something would
be there  so it is sort of ironic to see that the challenge today was the innovation that to some
extent saved the cp market back then  we are seeing the same kind of swelling of bank balance
sheets today that we were back thenan enormous amount of liquidity coming into the banking
system  in terms of the macro shocks there are some parallels and differences  we came into
the summer of 98 with an economy that was growing reasonably strongly exactly the time of
those productivity shocks that werent fully understood  some people had the intuition that those
productivity shocks were going to be strong but they were stronger than the greenbook and i
think any of the privatesector economists had anticipated  there was also an important
international shock which we dont have now and there was also a very strong policy response
which helped provide liquidity in the emerging markets  interestingly there was a policy cut of
75 basis points in a fairly short period of time  we will get to that in the second round
but something that i think is different is that the source of the uncertainty at least so far
as market participants were concerned was really focused very much on 1 the international
markets and 2 ltcm  the interventions in the international markets through the imf the
world bank and others were helping to respond to some of those  there was the working out in
september actually before any of the fomc rate cuts occurred to try to settle the ltcm issue
but being able to focus on the source of the uncertainty as the market participants perceived it
back then was very important  i think we have a much greater challenge today because the
source of uncertainty is really a change in the whole model of how these markets are operating
in the old days we used to know where the risks were unfortunately we knew that they were all
on the bank balance sheets  with the originatetodistribute model and securitization we have
been able to move to a different model in which the risks are much more dispersed  not all of
them are on the bank balance sheets although some of them are certainly going to be coming
onto the bank balance sheets so the banks never fully get out of this  but it leads to potential
pockets of uncertainty and that is exactly what has come up  people dont have as much
information as they thought they had  they were relying on traditional rating agencies and on
other sources that were perfectly fine for traditional credits but more of a challenge for the newer
credits  so i have sometimes said to market participants who talk about this well you know
you were too trusting of those ratings and i think now youve learned that ronald reagan was
right  trust but verify  thus theres a lot more that is being spent on trying to verify what
the value of credits is in these markets  you can see that as being somewhat inefficient because
now everybody has to do that individually rather than just rely on a centralized creditrating
agency but obviously there are questions about the effectiveness of that creditrating agency
that is one reason that i see a slow recovery in some of these marketsmarket participants
realize that they didnt have the information they thought they had  they are now going to have
to invest much more in getting that information  i think one thing that has been important in the
actions we have undertaken is to provide liquidity and support so that people should feel it is
worthwhile to make the investment to do the due diligence and to try to understand that they
need to verify the ratings or other things that are out there
the banking system as has been mentioned is in a good state but i dont want to
overstate that because there are challenges in bringing things onto the bank balance sheets  as
was mentioned a lot of capital is above the regulatory minimums but there is a reason that
banks hold capital above their regulatory minimums  they are concerned about ratings
regardless of what people may say about rating agencies these days they are still sensitive to
that  banks are worried about making sure that they are perceived as having sufficient capital
and sufficient liquidity  so one shouldnt just say well you can use up all that capital  with
the division of banking supervision and regulation we have tried to add up the maximum
amount of siv conduits the abcp that could come onto the books which is potentially in the
hundreds of billions of dollars and the amount of leveragedloan commitments which is about
280 billion to 300 billion just for the four or five major banks alone  that still doesnt bring
you to say capital falls below well capitalized but that is not where their banks want to be  so
i do think that the banks would react if these things started coming onto their books  in addition
we did some investigations with the occ through the shared national credit program  we
pulled records on about 900 credits at the major institutions to try to see what the underwriting
standards were  we foundor i should say that the examiners foundthat about 23 percent of
those were considered to have weak underwriting standards  now that doesnt necessarily mean
that there are going to be problems or losses but it was much higher than had been expected
about 28 percent of those were on us banks and 26 percent on foreign banking organizations
but almost half of them were on nonbank organizations  i dont want to overemphasize the
challenges to the banks but there still may be these pockets of weaknesses out there that we are
not sure about
what that brings me to in thinking of where we are is that we have gotten into a very
good situation from a riskmanagement point of view  by holding the line and being very
credible on inflation we have seen core numbers decline over the past three to six months and in
a fairly consistent way exactly as jeff lacker said  even as the markets have dramatically
reevaluated where they think policy is going to go in the short and intermediate terms we have
seen very little change in market expectations of inflation  that gives us a lot more potential to
be able to move forward  also from a riskmanagement and insurance perspective what if the
economy does take off  what if it is 199899  i have some numbers that the staff provided to
me  in the november 1998 fomc meeting which was the last time they raised interest rates
real gdp was forecasted at 33 percent for 98 and it turned out to be 45  they were predicting
16 percent growth for 99 it actually turned out to be 47  but the key from my perspective is
what happened to inflation because one way of thinking about it is what is the steepness of the
phillips curve  there may be other explanations for this  the greenbook forecast for the
november fomc meeting was 24 percent for core cpi inflation in 98 and the greenbook was
spot on  thats what it was in 98  the greenbook was forecasting 22 for 99  it turned out to
be 2 percent  it was actually lower than it had been and than was forecasted  so even with a 75
basis point increase even with very little effect on the macroeconomy it turned out that there
was not much of a tradeoff not much of a loss in buying that insurance  that heartens me as we
go into the next round to think about the policy choices  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  clearly the key issue in thinking about
where the economy is and what we need to do about policy is the financial destruction that is
going on right now  when i look at it i think about the different episodes that weve had in the
postworld war ii period and separate them into two sets of episodes  theres the episode of
1970 with the penn central crisis theres the 1987 stock market crash theres the 1998 ltcm
episode and then of course the world trade center terrorist tragedy in 2001  thats one group
in those contexts there was a lenderoflastresort operation  it was active policy on our part
and it did resolve the situation in the financial markets very quickly  the other episode is the
early 1990s when there was much more of a severe structural problem in which the banks got
into trouble  therefore it took quite a long time for them to fix their balance sheets in order to
get players back into the financial markets to make loans to people who had good investment
opportunities
when i look at the current episode i see something inbetween  i do not think that in this
case the situation can be resolved quickly because i think that the price discovery issues are
severe  in particular weve gone to an originatetodistribute model which governor kroszner
mentioned and we have found some serious flaws in it  the expectation is that we will have
new models coming out  in fact i think that this is actually going to be a longrun profit
opportunity for the banks  so if we were allowed to buy bank stocks i think it would be a good
idea  laughter  but the key problem is that this is going to take a substantial amount of time
even if things go very well in that context there is a substantial negative shock to aggregate
demand and therefore a substantially weaker economy  however the issue that most concerns
me here is that even though i think the modal forecast is that growth will be slower than we
expected the downside risk is actually very very substantial  though we may not be allowed to
mention it in public we have to mention the r word because there is now a significant
probability of recession  the problem here is really the interaction of the financial side with the
real side  im worried that as the economy becomes more nonlinear we have the potential for a
vicious circle or a downward spiral whatever phrase you want to usethat in particular we
have a financial disruption which means that its harder to allocate capital to people with
productive investment opportunities and as a result you get a contraction in economic activity
a contraction in economic activity makes information revelation or price discovery harder to do
that can then lead to more financial disruption which leads to a downward spiral in terms of
economic activity  so the big issue here for me is that this nonlinear element is very real right
now  the question is what to do about it and thats what we will be discussing shortly
however i think it is also important to recognize that inflation risks are just not that
severe right now  thats the good news because it will allow us flexibility to deal with the
situation  in particular we see inflation expectations that are very grounded something that
everybody has mentioned  also even in the modal forecast and not worrying about the
downside risks the expected future output gaps are more negative so we have less pressure
going forward there  i was happy that the staff slightly lowered the nairu estimate which was
consistent with my views in the past couple of cycles when i thought that it might be a smidgeon
under 5 percent  i think their revision makes sense and again it means that theres a bit less
likelihood of upside risk to inflation  then also there are the downside risks to real growth
when i look at the inflation situation i do think that inflation expectations are grounded around
2 percent right now  by the way thats not necessarily written in stone because things that we
might do could actually change inflation expectations but i think that we have to take inflation
expectations as given right now  however i see that the risks are slightly to the downside from
that 2 percent level because of the things that ive just mentioned  the key point here is that we
have a situation of potential nonlinearities big tail risk that could actually get very nasty and in
fact there is a potential for recession  on the other hand i dont see that inflation risk is the big
problem right now  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you all  let me just briefly
summarize and make a few additional comments  financial market conditions were a key theme
of our discussion today  recent developments in financial markets have been reflected in
reduced willingness to take risk and in tighter credit conditions  bank balance sheets are a
potential constraint on credit extension  participants were unsure about how long these
conditions would persist but the repricing of risk seems likely to be persistent  the tighter credit
conditions will very likely weaken an already very weak housing market as nonprime borrowers
are rationed out and jumbo mortgage borrowers pay higher premiums  mortgage rate resets and
foreclosures pose further risks  industries related to housing are naturally showing weakness
however creditworthy borrowers are able to obtain credit  secondquarter and thirdquarter
gdp figures may be solid but even so there have been some signs of slowing in the economy
even before the financial market developments notably in the labor markets and in housing
auto output is also on the weak side  labor markets do remain tight and in general main street
has been far less affected thus far than wall street  consumer spending continues to grow along
with incomes and net exports remain strong  financing should continue to be available for
capital investment  there were some regional differences in soundings on business confidence
and expectations but in any case uncertainty has increased  some of the key questions include
whether the further weakness of housing will spread to consumer spending whether credit
tightness will affect sectors other than housing including the household sector and commercial
real estate and whether the labor market will continue to slow  there is a general view that
downside risks to output have increased with some very bad scenarios at least conceivable
however others noted the resilience of the us economy and the fact that previous financial
crises had not necessarily reduced growth  inflation has moderated somewhat and more
participants view the risk to inflation as closer to balance  inflation expectations remain stable
and cyclical slowing is likely to reduce the pressure on resources  however tight labor markets
strong foreign demand high oil prices and other pressures still do exist
are there any questions or comments  let me just make as i said a few extra comments
here  more so than usual we have to look forward rather than backward  we have to try to
assess how these recent developments change the outlook and that is very difficult  to me the
critical elements to look at are housing and labor markets  i think the interaction of those two
sectors will determine the dynamics of the economy  there has been some discussion about the
fact that in 1998 there was very little effect of the financial markets on the real economy  there
was no obvious channel of effect in that episode  in this case there is i think a pretty clear
channel of effect through mortgage lending and we have already seen changes in availability of
mortgages and changes in cancellations sales expectations and the like  i would note that there
are alsoas you can see in the consumer confidence numbers for exampleexpectations on the
buyer side  if buyers think that the housing market is going to be very weak they will be less
likely to want to get into it  finally credit availability to homebuilders may also be an issue  so
i think there is pretty much a consensus that the housing sector will take another leg down based
on financial market conditions  i mention parenthetically that i have some concerns also about a
few other areas notably commercial real estate and perhaps others like consumer credit and
autos as well but again i think the focus should be on housing
on the labor side i think we can parse the job report numbers in some detail  for
example on the one hand the august report was not quite as weak as the markets thought it was
on the other hand it revised down some previous numbers  so overall there seems to be a sense
that labor markets were slowing a bit before the financial crisis  even so we have been
expecting weakening in labor markets for some time and i think now that the odds of that are
really quite high  i do expect to see continued expansion in construction layoffs  there are
losses of jobs obviously in mortgage finance and other related areas  so i dont know how
quickly the labor market will weaken but i do believe that it will weaken over the next couple of
quarters
now those are two predictions  then the question is what is the interaction between
those two things  i think there is potential for a negative feedback cycle which is of some
concern  if labor markets weaken particularly if they weaken severely in certain local areas it
will hurt house prices through two mechanisms  first house prices capitalize employment and
other economic opportunities in an area so house prices will fall as economic activity slows
second the demand for housing or the ability to make house payments directly depends on labor
income  working in the other direction as house prices fall the normal wealth effects but also
possible precautionary saving effects or other liquidity effects could begin to affect consumer
confidence and consumer spending and we get the makings of a potential recessionary dynamic
that may be difficult to head off  that is the scenario that concerns me  i dont know if its the
modal scenario but i think its one we need to watch very carefully
beyond that scenario there are further tail risks  as a number of people have mentioned
most recently governor mishkin these financial effectsfinancial accelerator effects if you
willcan be quite nonlinear  the greenbook has a 2 percent decline in house prices in each of
the next two years  its very possible that the decline could be greater than that  even if its not
greater than that it will not be uniformly distributed around the country  in some parts of the
country house price declines will be much more significant  the nonlinearity im talking about
has to do with the distribution of equity among families  if you have a 10 percent decline in
house prices and two families each of which has 50 percent equity in their home then each
family is going to experience basically the normal wealth effect  but if one family has 100
percent equity and the other has 5 to 10 percent equity the effects on behavior will not be linear
there will be a bigger effect on the family that finds itself in financial stress and the possibility
exists that weakening in these markets could feed back into some of the financial problems we
are seeing  so i am concerned about getting ahead of what could be an adverse dynamic
between the job market and the housing market
on inflation i think the slowing that we are likely to see will probably remove some of
the upside risk that we have been concerned about  i dont know how these housing
developments will affect owners equivalent rent  we saw some perverse effects last time  they
are still possible  a very small piece of information is that the ppi numbers yesterday actually
had some favorable news in them in terms of both intermediate goods and medical costs  so the
near term still looks to be fairly good  but i dont dismiss inflation risks by any means and we
know that policy changes can work through expectations as well as through resource pressure
and so i consider that to be a serious concern  nevertheless i do at this point think the principal
risks are to the downside and the interaction between different components of the economy
presents the biggest challenge in that respect  i will stop there  brian if you are ready to
introduce the policy alternatives now
mr madigan3  thank you mr chairman   to guard against the contingency that our security procedures have broken down and the committees policy drafts are being monitored by unknown forces the staff has taken countermeasures by circulating multiple drafts of table 1  laughter  of the two drafts circulated this morning i will be referring to the draft labeled perhaps too obviously september 18 2007  to summarize alternatives a and b would both reduce the target federal funds rate 50 basis points today to 4 percent but would differ in their risk assessment
alternative a would conclude that even after the 50 basis point easing the downside risks to growth would outweigh the upside risks to inflation whereas alternative b elides an assessment of the balance of risks but cites heightened uncertainty about the outlook  alternative c reduces rates 25 basis points and describes the risks as tilted to the downside  alternative d leaves the stance of policy unchanged but would characterize the risks to growth and inflation as now balanced  based on your remarks this morning and the proposals by nearly all the reserve banks to reduce the primary credit rate it seems likely that most or all of you favor some easing in the stance of policy today  thus the questions this morning would seem to be how much to reduce rates as well as the rationale for that action and the type of forwardlooking language to provide
the modal outlook in the staffs greenbook forecast would seem to argue clearly for policy easing before long  the staff has interpreted recent financial developments as likely to inflict an appreciable and fairly immediate adverse shock on aggregate demand  as dave noted real gdp growth is projected to slow to 1 percent in the fourth quarter and to remain nearly that sluggish in the first quarter  the economy skirts recession but real activity expands only 1 percent next year less than potential so modest slack emerges and the unemployment rate rises to nearly
5 percent a bit above the staffs downwardrevised estimate of the nairu  this slack contributes to an edging down of core inflation to just under 2 percent and declines in energy prices help push total pce inflation down to 1 percent next year beyond next year real growth gradually strengthens to around its potential rate  as i noted earlier today the central tendencies of your outyear projections suggest that most of you would find a pce inflation rate leveling out in the vicinity of 1 percent in conjunction with economic growth returning to a potential rate of around
2 percenta rate a bit higher than estimated by the staffto be an appealing outcome
of course while you may be satisfied with such an outcome the key question is what monetary policy path would be most likely to produce it  in the staffs baseline assessment a 50 basis point easing in the federal funds rate over the next few months sufficiently cushions the blow of the current financial shock to keep the expansion going in coming quarters while still allowing inflation to settle down to rates that

3  materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3
most of you evidently would find consistent with price stability  if your own modal outlook is similar to the staffs baseline assessment you might find the selection of any of alternatives a b or c at this meeting to be appropriate  an immediate
50 basis point reduction as in alternatives a and b would accelerate the drop in the actual federal funds rate by just a month or two relative to the greenbook  a 25 basis point easing today coupled with an assessment that the risks are tilted to the downside as in alternative c and an expectation on your part that another easing would likely be forthcoming would also be essentially consistent with the staff outlook  thus your choices among those three approaches might depend importantly on riskmanagement considerations
several of the greenbook alternative simulations explore the possibility that policy might need to be eased more aggressively  in the greater housing correction scenario the subprime mortgage market is assumed to remain closed over the entire projection period rather than to recover partially as in the baseline and housing prices decline 20 percent over the next two years rather than just a few percent  in such circumstances aggregate demand weakens considerably below baseline and the taylor rule suggests that the funds rate should gradually be eased to 4 percent by 2009  the greater housing correction with larger wealth effect scenario in which the effects of the greater housing contraction are augmented by a larger sensitivity of household spending to household wealth points to an even greater easing  another possibility is that forced acquisition by banks of large volumes of abcp leveraged loans and other assets erodes their capital ratios bringing them closer to regulatory thresholds and benchmarks negotiated with rating agencies and that banks respond by tightening credit terms and standards  partly because episodes featuring sharp changes in credit availability are relatively rare assessing these effects is fraught with uncertainty  but the bank capital crunch scenario in the greenbook which was based loosely on the early 1990s headwinds episode suggests that policy might need to be eased significantly and quickly with the funds rate dipping to 3 percent by june
if committee members are inclined to put appreciable weight on the possibility that something resembling any of these three scenarios could transpire they might be inclined toward alternative aan immediate reduction in the funds rate of 50 basis points at this meeting coupled with an assessment that the risks remain tilted to the downside  the effects of a preemptive easing of policyworking through the standard transmission channels of lower longterm yields a lower exchange value of the dollar and higher equity prices and household wealthmight help cushion the economy from a sharp weakening of aggregate demand  in current circumstances a relatively aggressive easing of policy and the sense that more could be coming if needed might be particularly helpful in thawing financial markets or at least in preventing a harder freeze and thus might work importantly through credit channels as well as directly through open market prices  a relatively large and immediate reduction in the federal funds rate might go some considerable distance toward alleviating concerns on the part of market participants regarding further erosion in the value of assets held as collateral  it might also be seen by investors as a signal that
the federal reserve will act forcefully to sustain economic growth helping to limit lenders concerns about losses  by reducing the fears of market participants and bankers about counterparty credit exposures and credit risks more generallyor at least helping to prevent them from worseninga prompt and sharp easing of policy might help avert a significant tightening in credit terms and standards and thus sustain growth in aggregate demand  in this way monetary policy might be directed proximately at improving the functioning of financial markets but ultimately at the committees longerrun objectives  this argument is easy both to misconstrue and to exaggerateeasy to misconstrue because it may appear that policy is responding directly to asset prices and easy to exaggerate because policy easing cannot do much to dispel the fundamental economic losses already in train for example on subprime mortgage investments  but it may be able to help prevent them from contributing to a cumulative weakening of activity that would increase credit risks more generally and feed back adversely onto growth
on the other hand the committee may not be persuaded that the hit to aggregate demand will be as severe as projected by the staff in its baseline forecast let alone in the weaker alternative simulations in the greenbook  members may feel that at least some of the history of financial crises over the past two decades suggests that financial markets can bounce back fairly quickly once the immediate crisis has passed and that the real economy can be surprisingly resilient in the face of temporary financial disruptions  both 1987 and 1998 come to mind as was pointed out previously as episodes in which at least arguably the restraining effects of financial events on the domestic economy were not nearly as severe as policymakers feared  a separate point is that many of you see potential gdp growth as a bit more robust than the staff suggesting that you may also see equilibrium real shortterm interest rates as a bit higher  coming back to the nearterm outlook for aggregate demand even if you think that the staff may be right about the likely degree of forthcoming financial restraint you may be quite uncertain on that score  any of these arguments may motivate you to consider the approach of alternative c  under that alternative you would ease 25 basis points today and issue a statement that characterizes the downside risks to growth as outweighing the upside risks to inflation  such an assessment would position you well to respond to incoming signs of economic weakness should they appear by easing policy at some point over the next meeting or two  this approach might also be seen as advantageous if you are particularly concerned that the committee would find it difficult to quickly reverse easing moves that subsequently proved to be unnecessary  you might also prefer a 25 basis point rate cut for now if you are concerned that investors could misread a 50 basis point easing as a sign that the committee was responding directly to asset prices potentially exacerbating moral hazard by encouraging excessive risktaking
alternative b may be seen as the middle ground between alternatives a and c alternative b would adopt the more aggressive 50 basis point policy easing of alternative a but would not make an explicit assessment of the balance of risks and thus would provide no direct indication that the committee was considering a further easing move  as noted in the bluebook adoption of alternative b would be
consistent with the 50 basis point downward revision to the greenbookconsistent measure of r  policy easing of roughly that magnitude over the next several quarters would also be consistent with the optimal policy calculations under a 2 percent inflation rule as well as with a number of the policy rules presented in the bluebook even if you are not sure that the adverse effects on aggregate demand of ongoing financial developments will be as severe as built into the greenbook baseline you may be concerned enough to judge that a 50 basis point easing of policy today would provide a measure of insurance that could prove valuable if as seems likely at a minimum further financial aftershocks become evident  as i noted the risk assessment proposed for alternative b is relatively openended  the current version suggests being explicit that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased for that reason it does not provide an explicit risk assessment you may believe given considerable uncertainty about the implications of financial developments to date and their likely course going forward that characterizing the balance of risks would be quite difficult and may lack credibility  for the same reasons you may find appealing the noncommittal approach of this alternative regarding future rate actions
as bill dudley noted market expectations for the path of monetary policy have fallen sharply over the intermeeting period  at the moment market participants seem to put substantial odds on both a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point easing today although given the modest improvement in credit markets over the past few days the former is now seen as somewhat more likely  shortterm rates would likely drop a little under alternative b and more sharply under a whereas they might move up a little under c  longerterm yields could decline noticeably under alternative a if the statement and the action prompted greater concern among market participants about the outlook  the inconclusive risk assessment of alternative b would likely surprise market participants and might prompt some volatility as they attempted to discern your message  but all things considered the rate actions and the statements associated with alternatives b and c do not seem sharply at odds with expectations and we would not expect large net market reactions
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any questions  if not well have our
policy goround  many people have already tipped their hands  we do have a 215 constraint so i
hope that people will keep that in mind  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  having been a part of this policy group for a
while the one thing i can tell you with certainty is that no matter what we do today it will be
criticized laughter and unlike us our critics will be absolutely confident in their position  so
having recognized that i would feel comfortable if the committee moves down 50 basis points
today and if possible i would like to be certain that we dont convey that other moves will follow
in the future unless the economic and inflation outlooks require it  there are a couple of reasons for
this  the first is obvious  the turmoil and the increased uncertainty about the future which i think
as a monetary policy group we have to take into consideration  second as i said in my earlier
remarks i think that our effective policy has become tighter over the past year and therefore it
warrants some reduction in real rates  this will take us a little bit closer toward neutral which i
think is an appropriate place for us to be
with that said as far as the statement goes i feel most comfortable with alternative b  that
covers one part of my reason for wanting this reduction and i think that the inflation outlook and
the real rates can go unsaid for the time being  i would also just mention that depending on how
our conversation about the auction credit facility goes i would be comfortable with an appropriate
discount rate of the same amount or as i said in our earlier video conferences i would not have any
opposition to that discount rate coming down an additional 25 basis points beyond what im
recommending here for the fed funds rate  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as many of you might imagine ive struggled
mightily with this particular decision  my outlook for the economy has changed sufficiently for me
to support a cut in the fed funds rate at this meeting  my reasoning may be a little different from
that of some of you nonetheless it leads to the same outcome  my view is in many ways similar to
that of president evansthat economic growth has slowed and it is likely to be somewhat slower
into 2008  thus my view that the equilibrium real rate has declined and its forecast has declined
somewhat leads to my view that the funds rate needs to follow that real rate down  also given the
current behavior of inflation i am more comfortable moving toward what i would consider to be a
more neutral rate
if we do cut the funds rate today however i believe that how we communicate that is far
more important than anything that we may do in a long time  this is particularly true since we have
not been particularly clear about our inflation goals  as i mentioned in my earlier comments id be
much more comfortable with this if we had a numerical target which would help anchor
expectations  i think we need to convey the idea that our policy as many have said is based on our
forecast for growth and inflation and that it is forward looking  that forecast has changed and we
have lowered interest rates consistent with that revision  with that change in policy we need to
have a balanceofrisks statement that is much more balanced in its assessment moreover we need
to convey to the market that we expect to see some weak data in future months but that those data to
a large degree are already built into our forecast  the weakerthanexpected data in the coming
months will not necessarily result in a new forecast  for example i wont be revising my forecast
just because the september employment report comes in weak  its only when we accumulate
sufficient evidence that the economy is veering from our new projected path that we would want to
revise our forecast and perhaps our policy although i do want to remind everyone that revisions can
go both ways  we might be revising our growth forecast up if the evidence suggests that weve
been too pessimistic about housing or about bank credit availability or as dave stockton
mentioned about consumer sentiment  similarly we might find that weve been too optimistic
about inflation if inflation expectations rise  i think it is crucial that we try to convey these ideas to
the public if not in the statement then at least in the minutes and our speeches going forward  let
me note that our decision to produce our forecasts on a more frequent basis will be a major step
forward in actually trying to convey this type of information
i think it would be a mistake as president hoenig suggests to set up expectations with our
language that the rate cut today is necessarily or even likely the start of a series of rate cuts  this
expectation could even undermine our action to the extent that it causes consumers and businesses
to postpone spending until they think were done and could give the impression that with each new
piece of weak data well be lowering the funds rate further even though we have already
incorporated that into our forecast  this reasoning leads me to think that if were going to cut rates
today i would prefer to do 50 basis points providedand its a big provisothat we work hard in
our statement to convey the idea that the action we are taking is based on something like balanced
risks  we have brought the rate to a level that we think is consistent with our new forecast and
consistent with our goals of inflation and output growth  in fact we may even be on hold for a
while after this if things pan out according to what the greenbook suggests  i think a 25 basis point
cut would risk setting up expectations for further cuts which perhaps would be read as taking the
same strategy to lower rates as we took to raise them  i want to avoid that  i do realize theres some
risk that a more aggressive action could actually reignite inflation expectations  vice chairman
geithner made three good points about what the risks of a more aggressive action are  expectations
of inflation fear in the marketplace that we see something they dont and that the economy is
actually worse than theyre predicting and the potential for fueling those people who think we are
bailing people out and thereby creating moral hazard  those are risks  i dont deny that  but i
think they are manageable particularly if we mitigate them through our statement by saying that we
now think risks are balanced and conveying the forwardlooking impressions that i have given
this brings me to language  of the three alternatives in the bluebook obviously in terms of
rate cuts alternative b is probably where id start although im more inclined to have a more
balanced approach to risk in paragraph 4  in fact something more like paragraph 4 in alternative d
would suit me better but perhaps a simpler way would be to rewrite paragraph 4 as follows  this is
just a suggestionits a little shorter  with this action the committee judges that the downside
risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation  the committee
will continue to monitor incoming economic information relative to the outlook and act as needed to
foster price stability and sustainable economic growth  that is a little shorter and conveys the kind
of balance that i think is important  in some versions of the statement we have had a little too much
of a temptation to promote the idea that we can finetune the economy and i think thats a
dangerous and slippery slope  with regard to the rationale im happy with paragraph 3 on inflation
indeed i noticed that there was no capacity utilization in that statement which pleases me no end
laughter  you know we have to take small victories when we can
i would like to see some changes to paragraph 2  in particular id like us to say a little less
about the disruptions in the financial markets  i think this has the potential to confuse peoplethat
our move is being taken as a desire to bail out bad actorsand that could feed into moral hazard
we are moving because our outlook for the broader economy is weakening  the tightening of
credit conditions may have the potential to affect the real economy and thats why we are acting
preemptively  so i would again try to simplify paragraph 2 and i suggest the following language
economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year but labor market strength has
moderated and the housing correction appears to have intensified and may be exacerbated by the
tightening of credit conditions  todays action is intended to help forestall some of the potential
adverse effects of those events on the broader economy and to promote moderate growth over
time  finally as i said earlier i believe it will be very important to communicate in the minutes
and perhaps our speeches going forward that our forecast incorporates weak data in the near term
and although we may individually have different views as to what that near term might look like
that forecast has been incorporated in our funds rate assessment and we intend to alter our bias or
our policy only if our forecast changes appreciably in the months to come  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i think theres a general consensus that we
should ease  to me the question is not whether to ease but how much is appropriate  to ease by
25 basis points i think could be justified by slow housing and weakening labor markets in the
absence of any financial turmoil  however im concerned that a 25 basis point ease today might
very well need to be followed by another ease quite possibly before the next meeting  given the
economic slowing we have seen and the additional slowing that is already likely as a result of the
increase in many shortterm interest rates i prefer a more aggressive approach  a 50 basis point
reduction will offset some of the tightening that has already occurred in shortterm interest rates and
will reduce the likelihood that the most pessimistic outcomes for housing prices and residential
investment will occur  furthermore it seems appropriate insurance against tail events given that
inflation pressures are unlikely to be a problem given the current economic outlook  alternative b
in conjunction with other actions designed to improve liquidity seems the most appropriate given
the current economic outlook
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  ive already said that i dont see that the risk is on the inflation front right
now although clearly we have to keep monitoring inflation and that the serious risk is the nonlinear
downward spiral that could occur  of course the big problem is really the issue of information
revelation and price discovery  i want to point out that there are really two sources of this  one is
that its very difficult for the market to figure out what the value of assets in these structured
products is  clearly that will take a long time to work out and it is not something that monetary
policy can do anything about  the second source of the problem of price discovery is the fear that
in fact we might have a severe economic downturn and we can do something about that  so in this
context a cut is not controversial because everybody is coming to the conclusion that we should cut
the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and in particular that we want to get ahead of the curve to
indicate to the markets that we are on top of this and that we are trying to remove the downside tail
that were particularly worried about
but i want to talk a little about a somewhat longerrun perspective on monetary policy
strategy and how we might proceed from here  the way i think about this is that the situations we
have to deal with fall into two camps  the normal situation is when things are fairly linear when
we dont have financial disruptions  in that case there is a lot of reason to have what has been
characterized in the academic literature as policy inertiathat is the idea that when you move the
federal funds rate you dont move it back quickly and in fact you have very persistent federal
funds rate moves  indeed i think that is the right thing to do under normal circumstances  clearly
theres an issue that moving a very shortterm interest rate will not have an effect unless people
expect it to persist  because the longerrun part of the term structure is more relevant to peoples
decisions in terms of spending theres a very strong case for pursuing things in a persistent way
also there is always a problem that when you reverse people may say gee you didnt know
what you were doing and you had to change your mind  so theres always this issue of flip
flopping that you have to be concerned about  the other situation is exactly the environment were
in when you really have to take out insurance against something that has the potential to create a
downward spiral thats hard to control  its particularly imperative in that situation that you get
ahead of the curve  in fact theres a very strong case to make sure in that situation that you
emphasize to the markets that you are trying to take out insurance against the downward spiral  but
if you are successful things may start to turn around and if things go the right way which is what
you hope happens then you want to reverse course  so in the projections that i provided i did
something that was unusual  i think i was the only person to have a rate reversal in the projections
oh you did too  okay  so i had us going down 50 at this meeting  i thought there was a
possibilitythough i hope notthat we might have to go 50 at the next meeting and if we did that
would certainly be enough and then we would move back up afterwards  so in this context i think
that we really do have to think in terms of potential reversals and therefore to not be scared of
overshooting a bit  there tends to be a lot of inertia in the way we do monetary policyit is well
documented  theres even inertia in general just in that we have nineteen participants at a table
as an academic i mentioned to don kohn at one point that sometimes i think these meetings have
elements of faculty meetings and that is not always something that you enjoy  laughter  some of
you guys may not have experienced that but its a lot of fun  so i think the bottom line here is that
we have to be prepared to think about being much more aggressive not just now but even in the
future  however i do want to point out that this does not mean that we should have an alternative
that indicates that we are going to do further cuts in the future  i strongly advocate alternative b
because by aggressive action now we may start turning the markets around and if thats the case
then it will not be necessary for us to quickly do more  so we do not want to say to the markets that
we have to keep on going when were hoping that we wont have to keep on going  i think thats
extremely important in thinking about where we are right now
another issue in terms of an extremely aggressive policy and then possibly doing reversals
is the moral hazard context  again i think this is a communication issue  i have a slight
disagreement with president plosser in that i think we have to talk about the financial market
disruptions because it is very important to indicate that in being very aggressive we are not losing
sight of our inflation goals and that this is a case of worrying about the downside tail that we have to
deal with and really showing that were on the ball in that context  so were in a slightly different
situation from the normal one and i would advocate keeping the discussion of financial disruptions
in our statement the way we have it now  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  as you know im an advocate of twoday
meetings  this is exactly why  michelle informs me that our true dropdead time is 145  so we do
need please to be efficient  next is president lockhart
mr lockhart  well in my earlier remarks i stated my reasons for supporting 50 basis
points so i will play calvin coolidge herethat is 50 basis points alternative b  its important
that we neither signal further actions nor suggest that were through and that we preserve some
flexibility because of the uncertainty  so thats my comment  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  given the shift that i am projecting in
economic outlook i think that a more decisive action is called for today and i support a 50 basis
point cut in the fed funds target rate  in the past few meetings i was in favor of setting our fed funds
target rate above neutral to secure progress for disinflation but that stance no longer seems
compelling  recent inflation reports have been encouraging and my outlook for inflation shows
inflation remaining in an acceptable range  furthermore an aboveneutral stance does not seem
prudent given my projection for economic growth  im in favor of moving our policy stance back to
neutral  obviously it is difficult to know exactly where that is but if the economy is in the midst of
a rapid adjustment i would prefer not to be behind the curve  so i would prefer not to be chasing
neutral down  gradualism has its place but in this instance i would prefer a more aggressive move
today and to not leave markets with an expectation of a long sequence of moves as others have
already noted
i prefer the language of alternative b  yes we may see a great falloff in confidence and a
further deterioration in the economic outlook but the recent business pessimism that i talked about
earlier may also prove to be unfounded  therefore id prefer not to lock ourselves into further rate
reductions  i also like the uncertainty language thats been added to the new version of alternative
b  i think again with the 50 basis point move today theres a good chance that well be close to
neutral and thats exactly where i think we should be with the uncertainty that many of us see in the
outlook  i also take very seriously the risk of undermining the appropriate pricing of risk in
financial markets that we face  the longrun success of a decisive move today pivots on the ability
to make clear that we take such action in recognition of the current economic environment and that
it is not a rush to protect investors from poor past business decisions  so i support a clear statement
that should be we later find ourselves in calmer financial waters and stronger economic winds we
will move quickly to affirm our commitment to achieving and maintaining price stability  now
because of this preference for downplaying the financial market disruptions i think a simple way to
remove at least one reference to them is to end paragraph 2 after the word ariseso todays
action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might
otherwise arise  that gets rid of one reference to disruptions in financial markets  also the last
part of that statement on promoting moderate growth over time almost gets lost in that language so
it might be simpler to just end the paragraph after arise  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i think the actual signs of softness weve seen
are significant enough to warrant a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate  i expect that the
slowdown is going to be a little less severe than that in the greenbook and im concerned about the
likelihood of inflations remaining above my objective  arguments for a larger cut appear to rest on
the possibility that financial turbulence since last month could cause significant further reductions in
real activity  i think thats certainly a plausible possibility and we cant rule it out at this point  but
i dont see it as extremely likely and so my preference is for a cut of 25 basis points  i would
describe that preference as a mild one and i could support a 50 basis point cut  i just have this
hunch that a 50 basis point cut might make it easier for us to resist a further cut two meetings down
the road
whichever we choose though im very concerned about how we justify our actions and i
share the concerns of presidents plosser and pianalto about paragraph 2  that language motivates
the cut as a way of taking out insurance against the possible effects of financial market turmoil  i
worry that if we tie our actions too closely to the expected effects of financial market conditions as
much as we are concerned about this we may make it harder to respond appropriately down the
road if the data indicate that we should take back some rate reductions  the sense of fragility in
financial markets could well persist and as long as it does so will the possibility that financial
market volatility could create a drag on spending and growth  the persistence of that fragility could
hold us back from reversing course if we find that real indicators and inflation data indicate that we
ought to  if we do reduce the target rate by 50 basis points i think we should remove the tilt  i
liked the original version of alternative b that was circulated in the bluebook  as drafted now it
talks about uncertainty and one could argue thats a meanpreserving spread but i think in the
context its going to be read as the equivalent of a downward tilt  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  given my outlook for growth and inflation and
my assessment of the neutral federal funds rate i can readily agree to 50 basis points in cuts on a
cumulative basis  i came into this meeting having a slight preference for alternative c and doing
25 basis points today with an expectation of 25 at the next meeting  i thought that that would take
us to a point at which more data would come out and it would be more likely that we could perhaps
stop at a 4 percent fed funds rate  obviously if we cut 50 basis points today and i have no
disagreement with that i think it is then a little more difficult to stop there  i agree with some of the
previous comments that any action beyond that should be based on incoming data that we dont
expect  that is kind of difficult from a communication standpoint  but im fine with alternative b
in fact the language is fine
id just like to take a minute to talk about risk management  we talked a lot about that in
terms of tail risk and nonlinearities and insurance and i think this is quite appropriate in the current
environment  but we have to continue to ask what happens in the more likely event that things
turn out better than these tail events  thats why theyre called tail events  so i agree with
governor mishkin that we have to be very careful to think about taking them back  if we respond
aggressively to address financial conditions beyond our dual mandate goals we should be prepared
to retrace that pattern of federal funds rate cuts if conditions calm  with respect to the comments
that governor kroszner made about inflation i think you have to be a little careful  my memory of
98 was that we actually had a tightening bias when the russian defaultltcm came in  we cut
75 basis points  things got better  by the spring we were debating whether or not we should
tighten  by the june meeting we did begin to tighten and we went up to 6 percent  my memory
of core cpi in 2000 is that it increased about  percentage point  i think there was some divergence
between pce and cpi over that time period  it is something to keep in mind but i can support 50
today
chairman bernanke  president evans joins the table with twelve years of
experience already  laughter
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  ill be glad if you dont tell how many years of
experience i have around this table  laughter  i support the action and the language of alternative
b for the reasons that have been given by many others around this table  i think that the odds favor
a significant reduction in aggregate demand owing to the financial conditions weve all been talking
about  i agree with governor mishkin that part of the disruptive effects of the financial conditions
are the small chance of a very adverse effectthe sort of interactions you were talking about mr
chairman  holding back and doing just 25 in that context would be a mistake  going ahead and
doing 50 will largely relieve some uncertainty
with regard to some of the comments about language the discussion of credit conditions in
financial markets in paragraph 2 i guess my read of what we talked about today was just this and it
seems to me that the way it is now is very transparent  its a nice replication of the discussion we
have had and so i dont see a need to subtract language about financial markets from this  with
regard to the balance of risks in paragraph 4 also consistent with our discussion is the sense that
theres a huge amount of uncertainty about how things are going to evolve both the markets and the
effect on the economy  i dont feel as though i know enough to say that the risks are balanced  i
dont know  the range of outcomes is just too wide and theres very little central tendency in it
so id be very uncomfortable with a statement saying that i kind of thought the risks were balanced
i am much more comfortable with a statement that says there is a lot of uncertainty out there and
thats uncertainty around the economic outlook  so i think the current language in paragraph 4 is
also a nice representation of the discussion we had today and consistent with our ignorance
im not concerned about the moral hazard issues  i think our job is to keep the economy at
full employment and price stability and let asset markets fluctuate around that  there will be
winners and losers  thats fine  the congress told us to have maximum employment and stable
prices and thats what we should be about here  sometimes that means you need to move to keep
employment maximum or prices stable and we need to take account of the asset markets but not
worry about the effects of those actions on asset markets per se  holding backinertiabecause of
concerns about moral hazard would be a serious mistake  we shouldnt hold interest rates higher
than they need to be in order to impose additional cost on borrowers to teach lenders a lesson  too
many innocent bystanders would be hurt in that process  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i strongly support the bluebook alternative b  i
think a 50 basis point cut right away is appropriate and i like the language  my reasons for
supporting this action are first that inflation has been quite well behaved  im pretty sanguine
about the future  second i think the available economic data that preceded the financial shock are
separate from it and support a fed funds rate cut entirely on their own  you can see that just by
looking at the backwardlooking taylor rules in the bluebook which suggest that the fed funds rate
in the third and fourth quarters should be well below where it is now  in part inflation has come
down and as president hoenig and others have pointed out thats raised the real fed funds rateso
a real rate of 3 percent now  i think the stance of policy is unnecessarily restrictive and that is
before recent developments  third of course is that the financial shock has made financial
conditions more restrictive  even if things sort themselves out i think the conditions will remain
more restrictive  i thought the bluebook gave us a good method for seeing how much more in
showing that the greenbook implicit equilibrium funds rate has declined 50 basis points since
august that says to me that a 50 basis point cut is not too much to try to neutralize the shock and try
to forestall it from damaging the economy  as i contemplate the issue of 50 today or 25 with the
presumption that we would do 25 more in october i find myself strongly favoring 50 today  i think
we should be taking a forwardlooking approach and trying to forestall damage
i agree with governor mishkin that should developments later on call for us to reverse what
we have done we should not hesitate to do it  i really dont like the message that a 25 basis point
cut would essentially send to markets  it would seem to say well why did we do 25 basis points
today  its because we want to wait and monitor incoming data and see what effect the shock has
i think thats an unwise message to send  first it says that the policy is reactive rather than forward
looking and i hope were going to be coming out with a communication package that sends a rather
different message  also i really dont think were going to see that much in the spending data over
the next six weeks thats going to be convincing  i am also very concerned about the asymmetric
nature of the risks that we face and the possibility of the type of nonlinear negative dynamics that
governors mishkin and kohn and you mr chairman have mentioned
i like the language in the statement  i think its very well crafted  i like the idea of
discussing forestalling negative effects and our hope and sort of optimism that well be able to do it
by sufficient action today  i dont like the idea of putting out a statement today that says there are
continuing asymmetric downside risks  it leaves us open to the question if you think that then
why didnt you do more  i agree with governor kohn  i like the risk assessment because i
honestly dont know exactly what the risks are  i like the approach that were going to watch and
do what is appropriate as events unwind in the future and i dont want to have to say that i now feel
the downside risks are essentially balanced with other risks to inflation  i dont know that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i favor a cut of 50 basis points and i think that
the alternative b language does what we need it to do  its very much in our interest that the
markets settle down sooner rather than later  i also think that the moral hazard argument in this
context is simply wrong  its wrong because if you take an insurance company context there the
issue is that the policyholder takes action that is adverse to the interest of the insurance company
its in our interest and its in the economys interest that the markets settle down sooner rather than
later  we want subprime paper to trade  if its 30 cents on the dollar okay  nobody is talking
about subprime paper trading at 100 cents on the dollar or 98 cents on the dollar  we want the
market to function so that the positions can be adjusted and so that we can go back to a normal
situation in which the paper trades for what its really worth  if the data and the anecdotal
information justify going down 50 and going down only 50 our best chance to make that stick is
actually to do it all at once because if we can leave rates unchanged in our october meeting that
sets the default option for the following meeting also to be no change rather than further action  so
it seems to me our best chance of avoiding an overreaction is to do 50 now and then make the case
that were waiting to see how all of that works and we dont think that as time goes on it will
probably be necessary to do anything more  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i favor meaningful action today so thats a
50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate target along the lines of alternative b  i think i pretty
well laid out the reasons for that in my earlier comments  i think the financial disruptions do matter
for the shortterm path of the economy in a negative way  my judgment is that it is likely to be
nontrivial and so we should respond to that especially when underlying inflation seems to be
moving in the right direction and if anything moving a little more rapidly than i earlier anticipated
with regard to language well its very tempting to carry on about that and make michelle
even more nervous laughter but im convinced as i listen to the conversation that beauty really is
in the eyes of the beholder  i would make only two comments  first the language in alternative b
is basically fine with me  i think the final paragraph the assessment of risk leaves our options
open which to me is what were trying to do  i dont have a conviction about what were going to
want to do in october and i dont worry very much about whether at some point down the roadi
dont think its going to be all that soon because i dont think well have enough evidencewe will
decide we need to reverse some or all of whatever we wind up doing  thats okay too because
well be able to explain that fairly readily when the time comes  second i dont understand these
suggestions to take out references to financial market conditions  we devoted a lot of time to
talking about that subject today and at the last meeting and so to act as if it somehow hasnt been
important in what were considering here just doesnt make sense to me  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman i already presented my position  like president evans
i came into this room expecting to argue for a 25 basis point cut  unlike president evans im still
there laughter  i just want to record since ive already lost the battle two points  i think vice
chairman geithner said it right  governor kohn is absolutely correct  we should be guided by
what we think is going to happen in the economy and not be pushed around by the markets  thats
one reason im in favor of 25 basis points and not 50 with an eye open to possibly moving further
later  but the point that vice chairman geithner made that i think is relevant here is that we should
direct policy not to insulate but to facilitate  i think thats a key point  another is that we need to
demonstrate credibility that we have a feel for whats happening in the markets  on that basis we
need to at least be mindful that this is the first decision to move under the new fomc  im a little
worried despite my enormous admiration for president yellen about her interpretation of what is
reactive  indeed we might be viewed as being reactive by moving 50 basis points  i think thats a
real risk  what we say therefore is very importantnot just in the statement but also in our
subsequent minutes and speeches as president plosser said  im therefore a little sensitive to two
references to developments in financial markets  yes thats what we talked about but getting
ahead of the curve we can state it too strongly and look as though were just way too reactive
particularly given that this is the first decision to cut  as president rosengren said theres no
question that were going to ease the question is how much  the only suggestion i would have on
the wording is to refer to the financial markets once rather than twice  the other thing i would ask
to be reassured on mr chairman is that if were going to go to 50 basis points it is not a lock that
we will put forward the new credit facility because i think doing that simultaneously with 50 basis
points would basically confirm that we are reactive and that were overreacting to the markets
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  just a quick point on moral hazardi think
there are fair concerns about it  the losses that have been felt in the markets in the past six weeks
that money is gone  it is not coming back  it is true that some of these institutions will find new
ways create new products buy assets cheap but that lesson has been learned  behavior is changed
i wont say forever laughter because that is an awfully long time but it is changed for purposes of
this cycle  profit profiles of all these financial institutions are now fundamentally different
nondepository institutions are looking at their access to capital in a dramatically different way
thinking about whether they have business models that work  so i think it overstates our ability to
suggest that whether we move 50 or more over the ensuing months we would somehow fix that
and make things like they once were  so i think the moral hazard argument in this context is really
a straw man that i just wanted after governor kohns comment to kick one more time
in terms of the stance of monetary policy as weve discussed the equilibrium rate here is a
function of fed funds and a function of whats happening in the real capital markets  the real
capital markets are fundamentally different and so a reduction in the fed funds rate today of
50 basis points may or may not be sufficient to find some new equilibrium  i think we will need to
continue to evaluate that as we go forward  bottom line on the statement i support alternative b
and the 50 basis point reduction  i think the markets will have some genuine consternation this
afternoon and in the ensuing days in figuring out what we mean by paragraph 4  as others have
said there is some ambiguity but i suspect it is inevitable given that we really dont know what our
next actions will be  so i support alternative b as written  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you mr chairman  as i mentioned before from a risk
management perspective i think its very sensible to make a 50 basis point cut  we have an
environment in which the economy has been growing modestly  some of the numbers that weve
seen recentlythe lower numbers in the labor market in the revisions from the previous months as
well as from augustpresumably had nothing to do with the august financial turmoil or i think its
highly unlikely that the august numbers had anything to do with it  the housing market was
turning down  so even though we have been growing a little more strongly were really coming in
facing headwinds in some important markets  as the chairman mentioned the interaction between
those two leads to a potential for downside risk particularly in light of the financial market turmoil
that weve been seeing  i think its important to be aware of that and to take that into account in
undertaking our monetary policy actions
also as ive mentioned before and as others have mentioned even given the dramatic
changes that weve seen in the past month in market expectations about what we are going to do we
have not seen an uptick in inflation expectations in terms either of surveys or of the markets which
heartens me that a 50 basis point action is unlikely to have a large negative effect on expectations
about the future path of inflation particularly i think given the language in alternative b
i dont see this at all as being reactive  one thing that im extremely pleased to see is that
the fomc did not have an intermeeting cut  i think that would have been seen as reactive
remember back in 1998  the ltcm situation was worked out in late september  there was the
meeting with the 25 basis point cut and then there was the concern with another 25 basis point cut
that came after that and then the following meeting they did it  there was an intermeeting move
that seemed much more reactive  i think our approach has been very levelheaded and that is one
thing that has allowed the expected inflation rates to stay stable even as they expect us to cut the
policy rate  so im very much heartened by that  then with respect to what charlie and others have
brought up about reversals thats very important  exactly as president evans saidpardon me for
reverting to your civilian namelaughter certainly what happened was that by june the fomc
decided to reverse and then in the next three meetings reversed the 75 basis points  the fomc
went up to 6 percent and only about six or seven months later dramatically reversed that  many
people ex post have said moving up that much was illadvised  even before september 11 the
fomc had dropped interest rates approximately 400 basis points in a very short time suggesting a
very rapid reversal  so im not sure that it was necessary to go up to those heights to forestall
inflation pressure
so in this circumstance im very supportive of alternative b  i think it will be read well by
the markets that were aware of whats going on  we havent overreacted  we havent been
reactive  weve waited until our meeting and weve left our options open in alternative b honestly
admitting that we are uncertain about what is going forward and leaving open the possibility of
future actions  taking a stronger action now has the potential to help unlodge the logjam in the
markets and we may have to take fewer actions in the future
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i support mr chairman cutting the fed funds rate
50 basis points today and the language in alternative b and i cede the rest of my time to you
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you very much everyone  the one person
at the table who i know is going to be right is president hoenig who says that whatever we do is
going to be criticized  i can write the wall street journal editorial for tomorrow  laughter  i just
want to say that i think that moral hazard is a terribly misunderstood idea and that as the central
bank we have a responsibility to help markets function normally and to promote economic stability
broadly speaking  we are not in the business of bailing out individuals or businesses  as long as
we make that distinction i think were fine but it may be history that agrees to that rather than the
newspapers
so i do advocate 50 basis points  the modal assessment of the greenbook suggests that at
least 50 basis points are needed to restore a prefinancialcrisis neutrality  there have been some
differences about how severe this is likely to be but something on that order of magnitude seems
about right  there seem to be significant tail risks and i think some insurance is worthwhile  quite
frankly i thought about the alternative c option25 basis points and a downward bias  one of the
concerns i have would be that turmoil during the intermeeting period would sort of force us to come
in and do the next 25 and i would rather say that we did what we had to dowe are moving at the
meetingand let the markets absorb that  i also want to agree with rick and others who have noted
that we should be prepared to take this back and i state that for the record
on the statement i prefer alternative b  i have struggled with president pianaltos
interesting suggestion about deleting the last clause in paragraph 2  i guess in the end i would prefer
to leave it as it is  what this is doing is two things  first were trying very much to clarify in this
paragraph that what we care about are the effects on the broader economy  that is financial market
disruptions have occurred but we are trying to ameliorate the effects on the broader economy
second we need in some sense to play a little defense in that this is a sharp change from the
statement of august 7  what has changed since august 7  well clearly the most obvious thing
that has changed is the financial market situation which in turn has fed through to housing and other
parts of the economy
with respect to the assessment of risks i think what the market wants to hear is that we get
it that were here that we are ready to move as needed and that we pay attention to both parts of
our mandate  i do think that its a little premature to make that a balance of risks and the inherent
flexibility here is useful  president lackers comment that this is actually a downside balance of
risks is an interesting one  it might be taken that way to the extent that markets think that the
economy will deteriorate much further and the fed will have to respond  but our perspective is that
we will respond as needed and we should be careful to emphasize that in publicin the minutes
and elsewhere  so thats my recommendation50 basis points and alternative b  are there further
comments  if not could you please call the roll
ms danker  ill be reading the directive from page 35 of the bluebook and the
assessment of risks from the table distributed today
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing
the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent
then  developments in financial markets since the committees last regular meeting have
increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook  the committee will continue to assess
the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster
price stability and sustainable economic growth
chairman bernanke                                           yes
vice chairman geithner                                    yes

governor warsh                                                yes
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  we can recess now for half an hour
for lunch  the board of governors will vote but the rest can recess for lunch  laughter  during
lunch our congressional liaison person laricke blanchard will give us an informal update on
congressional matters  we will try to reconvene around 200
meeting recessed for lunch
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene our meeting  item 5 on the
agenda is communication  we have a couple of things to do  scott alvarez and his colleagues
have prepared a memo which you received on the issue of voting on the full statement  could
you give us a brief overview scott and then id like if possible just to get a sense of the table
i hope we dont have to get into a lengthy discussion
mr alvarez  i was delighted to hear this morning that employment of lawyers is now a factor in assessing the robustness of the economy  i recommend that in the committees drive for transparency however the fomc not disclose this new factor because undoubtedly there will be those among my colleagues in the legal profession who will sue for a more prominent and permanent place in the committees forecasting models  today ive been asked to address an element of  the committees governance  over time a consensus appears to have developed that the committee would prefer to change its current practice of approving only the assessment of risk portion of the policy announcement issued after each committee meeting and instead approve the entire statement  if that is the committees desire there are several methods for achieving that result  each method has advantages and disadvantages  a key concern in choosing an alternative involves the amount of flexibility that the committee wishes to retain to allow other methods for announcing its decisions especially in emergency intermeeting and special circumstances  a second key concern is how much attention the committee wants to draw to its change in practice
the first and simplest alternative would be for the committee just to begin voting on the entire statement along with the policy action  this approach maintains the maximum flexibility for the committee to alter its practice in different situations and to adjust the content of the statement  this approach also maintains the  flexibility of the chairman to issue a statement in times of emergency or special need if the committee chooses this alternative the committee also controls the amount of prominence that it calls to this change in the minutes  if the committee believes this change is significant it may include a robust discussion in the minutes  if it views the change as not significant it may have no or only a brief notice in the minutes
a second and slightly more formal alternative would be to adopt a nonbinding resolution outlining the committees desired new practice  a nonbinding resolution provides a more formal vehicle than the first alternative for explaining the change in voting practice in the minutes  at the same time because the resolution would be nonbinding it retains the flexibility of simply voting on the matter
the remaining two alternatives are the most formal and involve adopting a binding resolution or changing the committees rules to require committee approval of statements issued at each regularly scheduled meeting  these alternatives are more binding because they require further deliberate committee action to change the practice in the future  a rule change would also be very visible because in addition to an explanation in the committees minutes a rule change entails publication in the code of federal regulations  this would attract attention in part because the committees rules currently do not address voting practices beyond the requirements of a quorum  a formal resolution or a rule change may hold an advantage for a
member who wants to delineate publicly the exact content of the statement  on the other hand were the committee to desire to retain flexibility to alter the content of the statement a rule or resolution would have to be carefully crafted to ensure that flexibility  a binding resolution or a rule change could also limit the flexibility of the committee and of the chairman to speak about the fomcs actions  to date the chairman has retained the flexibility to speak for the committee in emergency and other situations  indeed the statement was originally a statement of the chairman not of the committee  if the committee desires to retain this flexibility and yet adopt a binding resolution or rule the resolution or rule could be drafted to maintain that flexibility  that concludes my presentation  i would be happy to entertain any questions
chairman bernanke  are there any questions for scott  well it appears that one
thing we can do is just do it  precedents have been pretty effective in this committee  for
example our circulation of table 1 has become a regular modus operandi  that does leave
flexibility  on the other hand if others would like to go further thats fine with me  is it the
sense of the committee that simply beginning to adopt this action would be adequate
several  yes
chairman bernanke  my sense of the table is then that we will just begin the
practice at the next meeting of voting on the entire statement  that of course raises the
possibility for dissent based on the statement  we have to use good judgment on that particular
decision  if there is dissent on the statement scott it would be explained in the minutes
mr alvarez  thats the current practice  thats right
chairman bernanke  thats the same practice we use for a dissent on the action
mr warsh  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr warsh  i dont feel strongly but would it make more sense to have this change be
consistent in time with changes in communication strategy more broadly  now recognizing this
is not of the same import but rather than have a question be raised and then have to explain it
through our communication folks and others i wonder whether this might not just be sort of a
housekeeping footnote as part of a broader communication rollout
chairman bernanke  well if our communication schedule continues along
current linesand we can discuss that nextit would in fact be in these minutes that we made
this decision right
mr kohn  well if were just going to do it we havent had a vote yet
chairman bernanke  so would it be okay if we just put this in the october
minutes reflecting the first time we took that action
mr kohn  right
mr alvarez  this would be just a discussion
chairman bernanke  all right  in that case it would be part of the overall
description  okay  thats a good suggestion  thank you  anyone else
mr lacker  im sorry  im confused about that  this is an agenda item at this
meeting
chairman bernanke  thats true
mr lacker  we could just say that this is our sense at this meeting of what were
going to do now and just leave it at that
chairman bernanke  well we also have another element coming up right now
an update by governor kohn on the communication strategy
mr alvarez  the committee neednt take a formal position today on what it does
particularly if the discussion suggests that the committee simply wants to act when the time is
right  so the minutes could be very general
mr lacker  i dont attach much substance to this  i dont think very many people
even know or care or would view this as a change
chairman bernanke  all else being equal well try to get it into the october
minutes  but if it turns out to be a problem well address it  any other comments  don do you
want to update us on the projections
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  we are planning right now to go live with the
enhanced projections process after the october meeting  the plan is to have a speech by the
chairman in early november and then the forecast and its narrative would be published with the
minutes of the october meeting so three weeks into november  i would have to say thats a
planning presumption and we are going to proceed on that basis  but who knows what the
circumstances will be when we get to the october meeting  the committee could well
reconsider whether that is the right time to add a new way of communicating about the future if
its an unsettled time  so we can discuss it again  no votes or final decisions today but just to
alert you about the planning process going forward
the subcommittee sent out some recommendations in terms of the variables and thats
what we used for this dry run  what we would like from you is if people have comments on the
whole thing or on the particular variables that we used to hear them  we also sent out some
material on uncertainty and how that is portrayed  the most important thing to lock in soon is
what variables we are going to ask you to use for the october meeting  we will have a twoday
meeting in october  we can discuss things further  we can discuss what the box on uncertainty
might look like when it comes out in november  so we dont really need to have a detailed
discussion on thatthough if you have comments they would be useful  but we do need to lock
in the variables  so the floor is open for anybody who wants to bring something to the attention
of the committee
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i was completely fine with the proposal  the only thing it mentioned
that i would slightly differ on is that i would like the box on uncertainty to come out with every
forecast narrativeyou know the four times a year deal  the negative is that it would be the
same each time so there would not be much that is new  but when you look at inflation reports
that people have done they frequently have a box thats the same each time  in my view the
issue of making sure that people understand that theres a lot of uncertainty about our forecast is
so critical that even if they ignore a bit because were putting it out every time and its just a
standard part of the package i think it is extremely important
chairman bernanke  other comments  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i feel generally comfortable with the trajectory youre
on and with the evolving shape of this thing  there is one issue still where it seems to me we
dont quite have it right which is that the narrative description does not because it really cannot
describe the story that is reflected in the central tendency of the forecast  so the narrative is
really more a repetition of the numbers and of what is in the tables around dispersion and that is
probably because we havent given the staff a way to talk about or let us talk about the story that
underpins it in some sense  since a central value in this innovation to the communication regime
is to give a bit more texture to the story that underpins the central tendency it would be worth
exploring whether we could figure out a way to design our discussion so that the staff could
write a narrative in a way that does a better job of allowing that  with that exception that
qualification it seems as though what you laid out don makes sense
chairman bernanke  i think the staff shouldnt hesitate to talk about different
points of view  it is not at all necessary to come up with or try to manufacture a consensus
narrative
vice chairman geithner  i didnt mean to suggest not having anything that
reflects the dispersion of views or the uncertainty around those views  but right now its so
skeletal that it doesnt add much value to the tables and it gives in some ways less texture than
what is in the minutes frankly about the outlook over time  if the central purpose of this is to
animate the set of judgments about the evolution we could do it a little better that way  this is
complicated because we have all sorts of different conditioning assumptions that underpin our
forecasts  when those conditioning assumptions vary you cant really tell much from what the
variance in the forecast is  we dont ask people to give a modal and an expected forecast and the
difference between the two even though we ask them about the balance of uncertainty in that
sense  so it is hard in some sense mr chairman but i didnt mean to suggest you would want
to do that because you want to try to force a consensus view
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  a lot of us this morning discussed tail risk and it does seem that
the tables we have right now might not capture the nature of tail risk that actually was critical to
a lot of that discussion  some things that are related to your ability to forecast variables are tied
to uncertainty  but looking forward there are also the kinds of risks which i dont think were
capturing that were central to some of our discussion  is there a way to capture tail risk or the
distributionkind of like the scenarios that are done in the greenbook but in effect what
people were talking about with tail risk  i dont think were quite there yet and i dont know
that we need to do it for the first round  but we need to give some more thought to what tail risk
means and what we actually mean when we talk about insurance
chairman bernanke  we have a section on the risks though right
mr kohn  and the skews  it should be possible in that context
mr mishkin  its hard to think about exactly how to do that in terms of the survey
but certainly thats exactly where the narrative would have a lot of value because its really hard
to do it just in terms of some kind of standard survey  i hope that in the future we wont have
many discussions like todays but we might  maybe that could be handled in the narrative
mr rosengren  yes it gets to the texture that tim was getting at  i was thinking
about maybe having a question that tries to capture it so that we could at least respond to it if its
an important point for us to cover
chairman bernanke  other comments  okay  thank you  our last item is
approaches to stabilizing money markets  let me make if i might just a few introductory
comments about where this came from and what were asking of you today  as we have been
thinking about various money market issues two things have come up  one is that there have
actually been a surprisingly large number of problems in dollar markets in europethat is
banks that need dollarbased funding
debbie reminds me that this is a joint boardfomc meeting and that i need a motion
mr kohn  i move to close the meeting
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  the first issue is the need
for dollar funding and dollar term funding by european banks which has caused problems in
europe but also has bled over to some extent to dollar markets in the united states  we have
been in conversations at various times with europe about a swap arrangement that would provide
dollars to europe to address this issue but the issue has not yet obviously been brought to you
as a committee  the second issue that we have been looking at is how to address the stigma of
the discount window  are there ways to provide liquidity that would help normalize money
markets particularly term money markets and would allow banks to make use of the enormous
amount of collateral they have at the discount window but would avoid the stigma and create a
more efficient system  the solution that the staff came up with on that was to have an auction
facility that would essentially set an endogenous price and because it was an auction it might
look more like a good business proposition rather than like a move of desperation and therefore
would not have the same stigma  so there are these two separate issuesthe auction facility as a
way of addressing the stigma of the discount window and the swap as a way of getting dollars
into the european dollar markets  some conversations that i had in particular with president
trichet of the european central bank came up with the possibility of combining these two
things essentially having auctions simultaneously in the united states and in europe and then
using the swap markets to provide the dollars to the extent that the ecb would like to have them
the swiss national bank expressed interest in joining this as well  in a moment you will be
hearing from the staff a few details about these proposals
now let me just say a couple of things  first one thing on governance is that the rules
here are that the auction credit facility requires an amendment of regulation which is a province
of the board so in that respect its a board decision  however obviously the bank presidents
are very much involved in this because it would involve discount window management and
therefore i think its fair for us to have the discussion of this from the perspective of the entire
committee  second the swaps would be of course a decision of the fomc and they obviously
would need a vote
we began working on this some weeks ago when the markets were in a particularly
stressful condition and our hope was to try to normalize those markets  as i said earlier today
the markets seem to be getting better and this may not be the exact moment that we want to be
doing this  however it might be a good idea to have this process or alternatively the two
separate processeswe could do either one without the otheravailable should market
conditions demand it  so what i would like to propose is that we have a presentation some
comments discussion and questions from you and well get a sense of the committee in terms
of where you are on this  what i will commit to is that we wont take any votes today but
before using either option or a combination of both options we will have a videoconference and
ask for your formal approval of the swaps and at least your consent to the acf  so we are not
planning to implement this immediately but we would like to have the possibility of having it as
an option should money markets seem to require it  so with that let me turn to the staff
vice chairman geithner  could i ask a question
chairman bernanke  yes please
vice chairman geithner  what does a closed meeting mean scott  does it
mean theres a transcript with a normal release or theres no transcript
mr alvarez  the fomc continues to be in meeting and so what is happening here
is part of the transcript of the fomc  but on top of that is a board meeting  the board meeting
has only minutes  those minutes are very summary  the current plan is that they wont be
released until after thursday
vice chairman geithner  but the minutes of the fomc meeting will be released
in two weeks
chairman bernanke  they will be very generalsomething like there was a
discussion of means to address money market issues
vice chairman geithner  explore the range of options to address
chairman bernanke  exactly  president lacker
mr lacker  another question about governance  maybe this isnt the appropriate
time but do you envision that approval by reserve bank boards of directors would be required
for this facility  is that part of the governance or is that maybe a question for later
chairman bernanke  go ahead
mr alvarez  well the auction credit facility doesnt require the approval of the
reserve banks  the board is required to set the rules for lending under 10b which is what well
explain in the program  however the interest rate on loans under the credit facility would of
course be established by the reserve banks and reviewed and determined by the board  so
depending on the governance of the different reserve banks it may be that the interest rate that
is the result of the auction would be something that the board of directors would want to
recommend  our proposal as youll hear it later on will be that the boards of directors adopt the
process rather than a particular interest rate and that would allow the auction to continue over
time
mr lacker  all right  so they would have to act to make the rate they set
determined by this process
mr alvarez  right  like seasonal credit works today
chairman bernanke  why dont you go ahead and make your presentation and
then well take questions
mr madigan  thank you mr chairman  your introductory remarks and the questioning and some answers that we just had covered some of the points that i was
going to make in my introductory comments  it has been a long day already and you received a detailed memo  so in view of that we thought we would abbreviate our briefings relative to what we had initially planned
in response to recent developments as you know the staff has proposed consideration of a set of responses that could be coordinated with actions of foreign central banks  we distributed considerable material to you on friday the gist of which is proposing an auction credit facility and swap lines for foreign central banks id like to note that a large number of staff here at the board and at the new york fed contributed intensive work to that document and to planning for the facility more generally and id like to mention pat parkinson and myron kwast whose names were inadvertently omitted from the list of authors
under the proposed facility the federal reserve would auction blocks of collateralized twentyeightday discount window credit to institutions eligible to borrow from our primary credit program  as the chairman said based on discussions with the european central bank and the swiss national bank we understand that those institutions are interested in conducting parallel auctions of term dollar credit to institutions located in their jurisdictions  those institutions have requested but to date only on a preliminary basis the establishment of reciprocal currency swaps lines on which they would draw to fund the extensions of dollar credit under such auctions we have provisionally assumed that 20 billion of twentyeightday acf loans would be auctioned each week over the course of four weeks building up to a maximum of 80 billion  the ecb would similarly auction up to 40 billion and the swiss national bank would auction up to a total of 20 billion
jim clouse was going to present a briefing providing additional background on the markets and the pros and cons of the proposal but we have decided to skip that at this point in the interest of time  jim could answer questions on that if youd like
but you may not have had a chance to absorb the details of the implementation and the reserve bank presidents in particular as well as the board members may be interested in them  sandy krieger will talk a little about that and then karen johnson will wrap up with some comments on the swap line  sandy
ms krieger4  thank you  i will discuss at a high level some of the operational aspects of the auction credit facility  yesterday scrm subcommittee on credit risk management members and discount window officers at your reserve banks talked together about the operational details  although they have had only hours to learn and to think about this they seem to be comfortable with the basics and are helping to work out the open items
so how would this work  first the watchwords for implementing this program would be simple and robust  this means employing many of the procedures that we already use locally to extend discount window credit  the discount staffs have the necessary expertise to receive and to screen bid information  the local reserve bank

4  materials used by ms krieger are appended to this transcript appendix 4
staff members are in the best position to know the bidders in their district  they would use many of the same procedures they use to accept discount window loan requests  the applications we use to determine adequate collateralization for discount window loan requests would be used to determine acceptability of auction bids with  a supplemental calculation to screen for the excess of collateralization we would be requiring for acf credit  the discount window hotline telephone infrastructurea number with multiple lines known to depository institutions dis in each district would be used for reserve bank staff to receive and confirm bids and awards from dis in the district  the scrm members and discount window officers are working now with board staff members on a communication plan for outreach to dis should this facility be implemented
let me now walk you briefly through the auction cycle that is in the handout  we have been contemplating that on friday at noon the board would announce the terms of the next auction  it would include for example on monday october 1 2007 there will be an auction for up to 20 billion of twentyeightday funds to be issued on thursday october 4 2007  bids may be submitted to local reserve banks between times x and y on the auction date the minimum bid size will be
50 million and the minimum bid rate will be z percent  the auction results will be announced on wednesday october 3 at 10 am eastern time  details pertaining to the eligibility the bidding and the award procedures would be defined in an announcement posted to the board of governors website and discount window staff would be available on the announcement date to answer calls to their local hotlines regarding the terms of the specific auction  on the morning of the auction date typically a monday the reserve bank staff would perform the necessary calculation to determine the maximum bid size for the eligible dis in their district based on collateral pledged  also on the auction date reserve bank staff members would receive and confirm or reject phone bids during the announced bidding window following defined procedures  after the close the reserve bank staff would submit formatted information to the auction agent by encrypted email  next the auction agent would combine the information from the individual reserve banks  a first step would be to constrain the separate bids from branches of the same foreign banking organization to comply with singlebidder rules
the administration of the other elements of the auction allocation is straightforward  a predefined process would award partial allocations at the stopout rate when bidding at this rate exceeds the maximum amount expressed in the auction announcement  the auction agent would communicate the awards back to reserve banks on tuesday afternoon and the reserve bank staff would check these against the stopout rate information that the auction agent provides  on wednesday the board would publicly announce the auction results and post this information to its website  at that point reserve banks would begin to notify the dis in their respective districts that submitted winning bids of the awards they would receive the following day and the rate they would be charged  on thursday reserve banks would post the term credit to the automated application that they currently use for
extensions of credit  unless otherwise requested by the di the credit would be posted to the dis reserve account at the end of the day
i have covered most if not all the details in the table of auction terms and the auction dateline that are in your handout and i will turn to karen to continue our presentation
ms johnson  in conjunction with the establishment of the acf the staff proposes that the fomc authorize temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with the european central bank and the swiss national bank  these facilities would provide dollar financing for parallel credit auctions for euro area and swiss banks which the staff understands would be conducted in a manner broadly similar to that provided for us banks by the acf which sandy just described  the proposal is for swap arrangements that would authorize the ecb and the snb to draw up to 10 billion and 5 billion respectively each week with individual draws for a period of twentyeight days  cumulative totals may reach 40 billion for the ecb and 20 billion for the snb  the swap arrangements would expire after six months unless renewed  the purchases of us dollars with foreign currency would be based on the prevailing spot exchange rate and the ecb and the snb would charge their banks and pay interest on the swap at the rate established each week by the us auction
these temporary swap arrangements are proposed so that dollar funding problems now faced by european banks particularly at terms longer than overnight can be addressed in a parallel manner and at the same time that dollar funding problems of us banks are addressed  improved conditions in european dollar trading would guard against the spillover of volatility in such trading to new york trading and could help reduce term funding pressures in us markets  establishment of these swap lines in parallel with the acf could have broad positive confidence effects  given the financial positions of these two central banks the swap lines would involve virtually no credit risk on our part  by providing dollars to the ecb and the snb to use in their efforts to address the term dollar funding problems in europe we benefit the credit markets without ourselves providing support to banks overseas
chairman bernanke  are there questions for the staff  president fisher
mr fisher  just so i understand this lets say paribas shows up at our auction
window  can they also show up at the european window or are we going to make sure that
theres no duplication  how do you make sure theres no duplication so that foreign banks
might get an advantage or vice versa
mr madigan  they will be able to bid in both president fisher
mr dudley  just as our banks will be able to bid in both
mr fisher  thats why i said vice versa  so for certain banks holding companies or
organizations there is really more than the stated limit right
ms johnson  well the europeans are going to impose a structure  its not no
limit its the sum of the two
mr fisher  i understand that  i just wanted to make sure that that was the case
thank you
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  two things one related to that  on the first page you said that you
consolidate all the foreign banking organizations  so in the united states they would just
operate as one even though they may have different subsidiaries and they will be treated as one
organization even if formally they have multiple organizations in the united states
ms krieger  under the singlebidder guidelines theyd be treated as one  but for
extensions of credit thats done at the local reserve bank  so their bids would be combined and
treated as one and then they would be disaggregated so the loans could be booked at the local
reserve bank
mr fisher  but again for paribas for example which can come to our discount
window the total sum would be 20 percent for any single credit across the system even though
it might be pieced out by bank
ms krieger  correct
mr fisher  thank you
mr kroszner  second in terms of the timing of the auction itself are there any
challenges because of some of the delays here  this seems like a somewhat slower process than
some other auctions that are runthe bids are submitted on monday and the notification isnt
until wednesday
ms krieger  yes  weve given ourselves a lot of time just because of the
uncertainty associated with it with an opportunity to change it if we were to do this over time
with learning
mr kroszner  so you have the flexibility if you get used to it to be able to do it
almost in real time
ms krieger  right  the preference is for settlement always to be on thursday so
we can time it with open market operations and to the extent that this is or is not combined with
actions in europe with some time parameters that might be sensitive to european time zones
but in terms of how long it takes to run a somewhat automated and somewhat manual auction
we dont really know  we dont anticipate that it will be that complicated but were giving
ourselves a little flexibility in the beginning
mr madigan  one point in this regard governor kroszner is that well be taking
the bids over the telephone  that just means that there is going to be a certain amount of time
depending on how many bidders show up  its not a fully automated process
chairman bernanke  president rosengren question
mr rosengren  i think that this is a very creative solution to thinking about the
stigma issue and providing liquidity to the market so i applaud the effort to try to broaden the
tools that we have to think about these kinds of issues  when i was thinking about how this
might actually work i did come up with a couple of operational questions  my thought was that
if we had this auction who would be the most likely to want to take the money out  i could
imagine a situation in which you would have five borrowers taking out the full 20 billion  if
those five were countrywide washington mutual and three european banks it would certainly
give the perception that we were focused on financial institutions that had significant risks  in
terms of worrying about markets as opposed to institutions i think there is a potential perception
issue  so my first question related to that is the following  you picked 20 percent of the auction
but if you picked a smaller percentage of the auction that any one institution could take by
broadening out the number of institutions i think there would be more of a perception that it was
designed for markets rather than for institutions  now i am aware that the offset to that is that
you might not take down the whole auction  so the less that any one institution can take the
greater is the risk that youre not fully subscribed or you presumably could change the amount
but id like to hear at least some thought as to how you came up with 20 percent
the second issue is that when we think about the discount window which is primarily for
overnight loans there seems to be a bit of ambiguity in terms of whether you are primary or
secondary credit and in this situation i think it starts becoming important  when i think of an
institution like countrywide having a 4 billion loan the ots views them as a 2rated
institution and i dont know how we would view them if we were regulating them  i do know
that the markets seem to be assessing them as being a good bit different from a 2rated
institution  so when were thinking about an institution that we might have concerns about
giving 23a exemptions and an institution that might have difficulty raising funds because the
market perception is that they are very very risky how comfortable are we with the way the
discount window thinks about primary and secondary credit for institutions that the financial
markets at least think have a high probability of a fall
my third question ties to the european banks  it seems for the european banks that the
ecb is better positioned to make the credit evaluation of whether they are risky or not risky and
the equivalent of our primarysecondary distinctions  given that the european banks have the
option to borrow assuming that the swap did go through it would seem preferable that they
borrow in europe rather than borrow here because i think about the incentives going forward  if
a european bank that has financial problems that say the german authorities and the german
bank are aware of but we may not be fully aware of borrowed 4 billion from our liquidity
window i wonder what the incentives are for either the institution or the regulator to fully
disclose the nature of the problems  id like to get your sense of why you think it necessary for
us banks to have access in both locations and for european banks to have access in both
locations  those were the three questions that i had
ms krieger  well starting with the last question i think the sense is that its a dollar
funding problem  obviously the markets are deepest here so thats part of the interest in
offering it here to the broad range of institutions and the institutions that need it  it is also related
to your question about the limits  one thing we did was to look at what the treasury does as an
auctioneer  they have a 35 percent limit  so we were working down from there trying to see
how low we felt comfortable going and not departing from what are typical auction norms  also
if this is really meant to facilitate funding for those who need it is there a possibility that if you
go too low you wont have the desired impact
ms johnson  could i add a couple of thoughts before you move on to the next thing
the concerns of the sort you raised are part of the reason that the swap is being proposed at all
consider just doing the acf  these are duly licensed depository institutions in the united
states  if we were to create the acf but to say that no duly licensed di in the united states with
a foreign parent could participate thats a huge change in our national treatment policy  thats
enormous  so without a decision to really change the way we approach licensed entities in the
united states we dont have a way of distinguishing foreign parent organizations from
domestically licensed dis
mr rosengren  but we would know whether they have access to an acf facility in
europe or an acf facility here and it would seem as though saying that you have access to an
acf facility somewhere would not exclude say the canadians or the japanese but would
exclude the europeans if they were participating in the same program
ms johnson  ill leave that to the lawyers to decide  but i am suggesting that by
creating a swap the staff had a presumption that the europeans could work with the ecb and a
certain hope if nothing else that they would work with the ecb  otherwise with no swap we
have basically put them back in the position that they are getting this directly from us
mr dudley  if i could just make two points  one reason that you might want to let
them borrow in both places is that their collateral may be in both places and they may have
different availability of collateral in the two locations  the second reason is that your goal at the
end of the day is to get the money to those who most need it  to the extent that you put
constraints on the system you are going to make it more difficult for the money to get to the
people who value it the most
mr rosengren  we make that distinction already in the discount window with
primary and secondary  so if you are at a camel rating of 4 or 5 we normally would not allow
you to borrow as a primary credit  if we are taking the discount window as an analogy yes we
want to give it to the people who need it but we dont want to give it to the people who need it
so much that they are about to fail
mr dudley  no i think we all agree on that  laughter
vice chairman geithner  but i think its clear in the documentation that to be
eligible to bid you have to be eligible to borrow at the primary credit facility
ms johnson  right
vice chairman geithner  to be eligible to bid in the auction as its designed
you have to be eligible to borrow from a federal reserve bank at the primary credit facility
now if you are an institution that is migrating across states of the world and ratings in the midst
of this fourweek program then wed face some awkward decision in that context  but i think
that karens response is right which is that in general in the world today we have a lot of large
institutions that are essentially dollar based that live with a big mismatch between the access to
liquidity in the currency where they may need it and the liquidity that the home country central
bank is willing to provide  in that context being open to respond to requests for a swap is a way
to help limit the risk you referred to which is that we dont want to live in a system where if
theres substantial dollarbased liquidity needed at a nonus institution if the only option that
exists is for us to be the ones providing liquidity then that would not be a terrific situation for us
or for the home country central bank and its supervisor probably because they will be better at
making the liquiditysolvency judgment in some sense  you would want them to have the means
to actually respond to that need if they think its appropriate without having the entire burden
for that come on us  on the other hand they exist here in the united states as depository
institutions  they have a set of not rights but expectations about what they can borrow and what
kind of liquidity insurance they can get from us and we cant change those in the middle of the
game
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin had a question
mr mishkin  actually great minds think alike  the first question you asked was
exactly the one i was going to ask
chairman bernanke  okay  president fisher
mr fisher  i have two questions  the degree to which this new lombard facilitys
bidding process would avoid the stigma issue is unclear  could you repeat to me how this deals
with the stigma issue  thats my first question and then i have another one after this
mr madigan  well partly by auctioning credit so institutions are coming to the
federal reserve voluntarily and paying a price that is market based  another point is that the
institutions are regarded as generally sound  they have to meet a certain qualification standard
to get to the discount window and we would be taking certain steps in terms of our reports to try
to distinguish this from other discount window credit  now that said i think we have to admit
that were not sure the degree to which this would deal with the stigma issue
mr fisher  i mean arent they still saying that they are distressed
mr dudley  no  no the economics are better because you have to think about the
minimum rate  the minimum rate is the swap rate plus 10 basis points which is well below one
month libor and well below the onemonth term fed funds rate  so there is that room in
between  you could actually criticize a bank for not participating in this  they are somehow
leaving money on the table by not taking advantage of this
mr fisher  im sure the small banks will  thats what i mean  thats why theyre
not going to like it  in other words this is a big institutional facility
mr dudley  not necessarily
mr mishkin  just as long as you need 50 million bucks
mr fisher  well you have to have 63 million if youre using the ratios youre
using in collateral  so there is that aspect  i understand thats what it was meant to address
my second question derives from the first and that is could you give us a little
background on the staffs discussion on having tighter standards  i gather there was some
discussion of that in terms of coming to the acf and being well capitalized but also well
managed  why the distinction and what is the state of play of that argument as opposed to the
regular requirements for going to the discount window
mr alvarez  we did consider imposing a higher standard something like well
capitalized and well managedthe financial holding company type standardsand two
concerns were raised  one is that it has the same problem that president rosengren referred to
that we have to rely on the exam rating and the capital adequacy determination by another
regulator  we dont get out of that problem by raising the standards and most of the institutions
that were referred to actually fit into the higher standard  so it didnt achieve very much  the
second thing is that there was some concern that it might have a blackballing effect  for folks
that were between the standard for primary credit and the higher standard that we were setting it
might indicate that the federal reserve felt those folks were weaker  those may in fact be
people we want to get some funding to  theyre the ones that seem to be struggling with
liquidity and this might make their problems worse because the market will perceive that the
fed wouldnt even be willing to lend to them under the facility
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  other questions  president hoenig
mr hoenig  just kind of on this point  there is a description of this as somewhat
prequalifying  you have to be available for primary credit  second its temporary  third its
in pretty rough times as far as when youre borrowing  im not sure youre going to get rid of
the stigma problem with this and youre going to go through a lot of gyrations to do something
that then youre going to have to unravel  are you sure that you want to do this  laughter  if i
were introducing this i think id be more inclined to introduce it in good times so that you get a
perspective going that is less subject to wide interpretation  thats a little concern i have as
much as anything
chairman bernanke  any other questions before we take general comments
governor kroszner
mr kroszner  quickly as a followup to thatif you are successful in getting rid of
the stigma problem then does the discount window effectively disappear
mr dudley  no
mr kroszner  but there might be pressure for it to disappear because this certainly
would be more desirable than the discount window  its cheaper and theres no stigma
mr dudley  but this is a temporary program
mr kroszner  deposit insurance ill remind you in 1933 was temporary
ms krieger  but when you have that inadvertent overnight overdraft that you are
facing you cant wait until the weekly auction
mr kroszner  okay  well done
vice chairman geithner  you are capping the amount in a way that you could
not reasonably decide youre going to cap total access to the discount window
mr madigan  of course this wouldnt substitute at all for secondary credit by
construction
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  in my thinking about the stigma point the time line is an important part of
that  if you have to submit your bid on monday to get awarded on thursday this is not the action
of a bank thats desperate for funding  i think the stigma comes because at the discount window
apart from bidding strongly at the end of the day and then ending up paying this penalty rate you
dont have anywhere else to go  so it seems to me this auction facility looks much more like a
liabilitymanagement facility than it does a facility for banks that absolutely have to get funds given
that theres a threeday or fourday wait until you get them
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we start our goround  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  ive been thinking a lot about this since i heard
about it last week  i want to start by complimenting the staff at new york and the board who wrote
the summary memo  i think it does a very good and balanced job of articulating the costs and
benefits of this proposed facility  i was going to say that they undoubtedly did it in a compressed
timeframe but then i heard you guys have been working on it for weeks  laughter  but in any
event my hat is off to them
i very much agree with the staff that weighing the costs and benefits to reach an assessment
about the desirability of this is inherently a difficult judgment  for me the critical question concerns
the normative implications of what were seeing in the marketplace for term funding and the
normative implications of this proposed intervention  banks that are borrowing at term now are
paying up for insurance against the eventuality that their funding costs risefor example because
of a deterioration in their perceived creditworthiness  banks that have viewed themselves as more
at risk are naturally willing to pay more for such insurance and some reports suggest as mr
dudley did this morning the presence of an adverseselection problem in the sense that borrowing
at term reveals oneself to be a borrower of high risk and so only highrisk borrowers are willing to
pay more  banks that are reluctant to lend at term are placing a high value on being able to use their
liquidity to accommodate assets that may come on their balance sheet soon  we had a lot of
discussion about this in the morning  balance sheet capacity appears genuinely to be a scarce
valuable commodity these days  thats consistent with the notion that raising bank capital is
expensive in the current environment  i think the adverseselection story is worth considering
seriously in this context because its the interpretation of what were seeing that provides the best
hope for this being an intervention that improves market functioning in the microeconomic sense of
the term
but if adverse selection is what has impaired the functioning of the term market in this
normative sense then there must be lowerrisk banks that are unwilling to borrow at the same high
rates as highrisk banks but that are rationed because theyre unable to distinguish themselves from
highrisk banks  now if this is the case the only way to improve market efficiency by lending is to
lend more than the current volume of term lending because otherwise were just going to lend it to
the current termlending borrowers and none of these rationedout lowerrisk banks are going to get
access to it  in other words if we do lend through an auction facility to draw in disadvantaged
borrowers to try to reach them with credit we can do so only by subsidizing the highrisk borrowers
as well  now ill mention that from the discussion this morning my understanding is that we have
very little idea what the volume of that term lending is  so i dont see how we chose this number
and how we can be confident that its going to do this and reach through the highrisk borrowers to
pick up the lowrisk borrowers
more broadly im not sure i see how this facility could improve the normative functioning
in the market  were going to auction off only the same contracts that market participants are
capable of offering now only were also going to subject ourselves to the additional constraints
imposed by our singleprice auction format  so were not improving on any contract out there  the
only unique attribute we would appear to bring is our ability to subsidize lending terms  we could
conceivably improve market functioning if adverse selection is the right story here by doing
something that market participants are incapable of doing and that would be compelling borrowing
by everybody or by a set of people to achieve a superior pooling allocation  but i dont think we
want to do that  or we could conceivably improve market functioning by acting on information
thats superior to that of market participantsa knowledge of the creditworthiness of institutions
for example  but it isnt clear that this is a key part of the proposal either because institutions have
to be rated 3 or above to get access and i think virtually all the currently affected institutions in these
sorts of highrisk and lowrisk categories are in the 3 or above categories already  a related point
here is that if we really think information constraints are at the heart of the problem it might be
better to address this problem by addressing those constraints directly by using our supervisory
authority to encourage and facilitate greater transparency  so my sense is that this facility would
just subsidize borrowing banks without doing anything to mitigate underlying informational
asymmetries or any other type of market friction that i can think of  that means to me that this
proposal raises the usual moral hazard concerns  the staff memo was very clear and articulate
about those  i think theres a danger with this facility of raising expectations that in the future
significant increases in interbank funding spreads are going to be ameliorated by central bank
intervention  if we raise that expectation were going to undermine to some extent market
mechanisms for assessing the relative risk of institutions
im a little worried that if this does not produce a demonstrable effect on relevant market
conditions it could erode confidence in us and i feel so especially in light of our previous change in
discount window policy which i think is widely viewed as having had little substantive effect so
far  i think thats the view out there  i also worry that this could complicate the resolution of failing
institutions whose condition as vice chairman geithner suggested deteriorates while theyre
borrowing from this auction facility  it would put us in a very awkward place  as governor kohn
said this isnt like a oneday emergency kind of thingit takes some time  but some institutions in
questionable situations some problem institutions look for term funding and are willing to wait
four days to get it and know enough about their condition to line it up ahead of time  i worry about
this sounding like a cloak for the ecb for us to give money to the ecb and i worry about
president rosengrens issues as well and id be more comfortable with the swap line than i am with
the domestic facility  if those foreign authorities want to extend credit and have the knowledge and
capacity to do so and its on their dime and theyre bearing the credit risk and they want to borrow
the dollars from us i see that as a reasonable step for a central bank to take  i also worry about
valuing collateral  i dont think that our mechanisms for doing that are robust and strong especially
in the current environment with at least standard haircuts
now i can appreciate the broader problem articulated by the staff and others that banks that
are constrained in the term funding market might tighten borrowing terms for consumers and
businesses and that might have real economic consequences  but if thats the problem i think it
would be better for us to just cut the funds rate rather than alter the relative funding costs of
different banks  this is essentially what we did today  we cut the funds rate to offset the
macroeconomic effects of higher credit spreads
just a final set of comments  more broadly ive been hoping for some time that banking
policy in our country was moving slowly but surely toward greater reliance on market discipline
and away from forbearance and subsidization  ive been hoping that we as a central bank would
gradually move away from things that are tainted with credit allocation  times like these dont
come around very oftenyou know once a decadeand my sense is that the precedent we set here
is going to be remembered for a long time and its going to affect market behavior for a long time to
come as well  in my opinion we ought to look at these episodes of market stress as an opportunity
to make some reputational progress on the timeconsistency problem that is at the heart of moral
hazard  so for me the balance of considerations weighs heavily against this proposal mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  let me echo what you first said and congratulate the staff on
an enormous amount of work and a terrific presentation  i do want to just say a word president
lacker  most of your arguments are premised on the idea that markets are basically in some kind of
equilibrium and were just messing with the equilibrium  theres a longstanding tradition both in
central banking and in theoretical analysis that you can have periods when there is insufficient cash
in the market and prices are therefore driven away from fundamentals by the lack of cash  what
central banks do is provide cash against collateral  i refer you for example to franklin allen and
douglas gales new book understanding financial crises in which they present a model with
exactly that property
the moral hazard issue is the following  there is a good reason to allow some deviation of
cashbased valuations from fundamentals because it creates incentives for providing sufficient
liquidity and rewards those who have sufficient liquidity  but beyond a certain range the models as
well as central banking experience suggest that when you have a fire sale type of situation then the
central bank can be useful by providing cash against that collateral  essentially this process would
take 140 billion of undervalued hardtosell or illiquid assets onto the central banks balance sheet
and provide term liquid funding in its place which i find totally consistent with bagehot and the
traditions of central bank lending  now the question arises whether the market is in sufficient
distress  if its not then were in the first regime where some deviation of values from
fundamentals is legitimate  if the market is in extreme distress i thinki repeat what i said
beforethere can be situations in which markets are simply not functioning well and there could be
a lot of reasons for that in which case the central bank could help the market function better  i agree
that some of these issues about bid size and so on do confuse the issue  we need to make a strong
distinction between helping these markets to function betterwe can address for example some of
the counterparty risk because we have all this collateral in our discount windowsand helping or
bailing out any individual institution  i agree with you that we certainly want to avoid that
perception if at all possible  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i like the idea  i think it does reduce stigma and it would likely
reduce the spread during a time of crisis  i would want it spread out among a larger number of
institutions than just five because i do worry about that potential  while i know that in your
documentation you highlighted that there wouldnt be a way to identify the institution my guess is
that given that this is a new facility there may be congressional hearings and i wouldnt be
surprised particularly if only five institutions borrowed from it if wed have to at least be prepared
for the possibility that it would become more public than under normal circumstances
so in these terms i think the haircuts that we think about for a twentyeightday period are a
little different from the haircuts you might take overnight in which case were going to have to
make sure that we really are collateralized sufficiently so that were not taking risks since that is a
principle of the discount window  i worry a bit about whether our primarysecondary distinction
was designed for this and we might want to at least rethink exactly how we classify primary versus
secondary credits  during times of distress this would be a way to try to provide liquidity but it
might also be worth at least thinking about some of the potential issues during those times of stress
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  again ill echo praise for just the incredible work that the staffs have
donea very clever way to address some specific problems that were facing  one is the stigma
problem and two as i mentioned earlier is the source of the uncertainty  we dont really have the
tool to get at that directly we can get at it only very indirectly  with the 1998 situation there was
another way to get at that  some people thought it was a good way some people thought it was a
bad way  we wont debate that but the market perception was that a particular institution was at
the heart of a lot of the uncertainty and if you could resolve that you could reduce that uncertainty
significantly  also the interventions by the imf and other organizations dealt with some of the
international uncertainties  with the traditional tools that we have were somewhat hampered in
trying to get at that so i think this is a very clever way to try to do so  but really my comments
echo what president rosengren has said  when we start to move from doing overnight to doing
term funding we may need to rethink what kind of collateral we have  obviously were now using
80 percent of collateral rather than 100 percent of collateral  thats certainly a step in the right
direction
we need to think about whether we need well capitalized and well managed  that creates
some challenges in trying to differentiate this from the overnight lending facility and as mr
alvarez said it raises some issues with respect to singling out institutions that make one hurdle but
dont make the other hurdle  but we need to think about it very carefully because the potential
challenge both from an optics point of view and a substantive point of view is that in the short run
we want to help out institutions in certain ways by providing funding but we dont want to be
helping out those that have not taken appropriate actions
in extreme circumstances like those we have now as the chairman said one could certainly
say that were out of equilibrium on pricing a lot of the assets pricing the collateral pricing the
value or pricing issuances by certain institutions and so it is extremely important that this be short
term and that those kinds of considerations be brought to the fore and thought through very
carefully and have the potential to be altered over time if we dont feel were having sufficient
haircuts  if we do feel that certain institutions may transit from one rating to another within twenty
eight days we need to be prepared to think about how to respond because it raises questions for a
leastcost resolution of institutions that may be going down  but i do think this is an extremely
creative approach to try to get at something that we otherwise didnt have easy tools to get at  it
may create a longerterm issue of an expectation that this kind of thing will come out again or that
there will be another type of clever innovation that will deal with the next market problem so that
people dont have to worry about those market problems  but thats a very difficult tradeoff to
make  i can support this as addressing the shortterm problem and i think we can largely deal with
some of those longerterm issues if we do stick to our guns and make it temporary and if we clearly
articulate what were trying to get at
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  one of the appealing things about it is that it broadens options and i think
that any time you are in a set of circumstances where you have to find solutions broadening your
options is good  i appreciate the fact that we are not voting on this today because i think it deserves
a little further thought especially about the unintended consequences  there are advantages to
saying it is temporary but im not sure that there arent also some disadvantages from that  there
are advantages in trying to remove the stigma but im not sure what other hazards you create
because if you dont prequalify what have you said to the world about that as well  so there are
lots of uncertainties around this that i would appreciate more time to think though before we
actually begin to implement it
chairman bernanke  okay  president poole
mr poole  the staff did a fine job of designing and explaining  i want to concentrate on
the issues that i have  im pleased that were not about to launch it  if we had one of my concerns
is that the united kingdom is left out which i assume is by choice but it might still create a whole
lot of issues for the united kingdom  im sure there would be a lot of questions in the market
why didnt you do itor whatever  it might have added pressure there that would not only have
complicated the uk situation but it might have ended up complicating our own situation  that
might still be an issue if we go this way in the future  im concerned that the method of setting the
minimum bid rate is not really transparent  as i gather from reading well tell the market the
number but we wont say what the reference rate is  are we going to announce that its tied to the
overnight swap rate  i had understood that we were not going to
ms krieger  we didnt say  it was based on a market rate for term funding
mr poole  but werent we going to announce that this overnight index swap
ms krieger  no i dont think that had been the plan
mr poole  okay  but then the first time that you change that rate you are going to raise
a whole lot of questionswell how did you decide how to change it  im more worried about the
transparency of setting it that way because it is bound to raise questions about where that rate comes
from  how did you decide on this one  it might be particularly true if that rate ends up being below
the target federal funds rate
chairman bernanke  this is news to me by the way because the logic of this was
that the normal spread between the overnight index swap and term funds is about 10 basis points
mr poole  yes but that depends on the markets expectations of where the funds rate is
going to go
chairman bernanke  but the ois captures thatthe onemonth ois
mr poole  i understand that but that can be different from the current target rate thats
in effect right now  thats my point  this rate could be below the current target rate and that
seems to me to create an issue that we are going to have to be prepared to explain and im not so
sure thats going to be easy to explain  at any rate ill leave that on the table for the moment
mr evans  are you saying that the minimum rate is going to be a secret
mr fisher  well theyll figure it out
mr mishkin  wont they figure it out almost immediately
mr stern  if theyre going to figure it out why dont we tell them
ms krieger  the question is whether you identify a particular market rate that youre
pegging or whether you say youre looking at marketbased rates  i think thats a decision variable
of this program
mr evans  i just didnt realize this was as highly confidential
ms krieger  but you have the auction announcement  you must tell the bidders ahead
of time what the minimum rate acceptable is
mr poole  youll tell them the basis points
ms krieger  yes
mr dudley  they should figure out pretty quickly what this rate means
chairman bernanke  i would suggest that we not get too involved in this  i think
we ought to be as transparent as possible
mr poole  no but i just say that i think theres a transparency issue here that might
have to be explained  so ill just leave that on the table to be talked about  there is certainly a risk
that this facility will not bewell maybe this would not be a wrong judgmentavailable to small
banks and the large banks would be getting access to discount window funds at a rate potentially
well below that available to small banks  if this were to become a political controversy with some
of those who are less friendly to us in the congress than others it would complicate the value of
this  i would hate to see us get embroiled in a political controversy over this because we were
discriminating against 98 percent of the banks in the eighth federal reserve district as well as
some of the other federal reserve districts
if we were to launch this if we were voting today this would create a big issue in terms of
our directors because we would be announcing to the directors what discount rate they would have
to set under the federal reserve act  so if we are preparing to do this in the future i think it is very
important that we have material prepared and that we take it up with our directors in advance so that
they will know what we will be asking of them because this could be a very big problem  we need
to make sure that we have the directors on our side and that we have prepared them so that if we
have to do it they will know what the reasoning is
finally once the dust settles assuming that we dont need to do this before the markets
return to a reasonable normality i dont see any reason that we couldnt have this well planned and
actually run a trial or maybe even have a trial once a year or something like that so that the banks
and the markets understand how this works  then you can pull it out of your pocket if you really
need it in crisis circumstances  everybody would have understood it because you would have
actually done it  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman a lot of what i have thought about this since i realized we
werent going to do this immediately has been addressed by the previous individuals who have
spoken  id just like to touch on a few points  first like everyone else i want to congratulate the
staff for excellent work  it is creative  its also very well balanced in the way that the pros and the
cons are argued  bagehot and the lombard facility not withstanding it seems to me that if we
proceed down this path we have to position it so that its a refinement of what we did in august
rather than a confession of failure or insufficiency  that would be point number 1
still president lacker made some very good points and part of this gets to what president
poole just mentioned and that is that some political risk in addition to the risk of failure is there
and we have to acknowledge that it may not work  i have some concerns about the value of
collateral and the automaticity as it were in this kind of new facility and our ability to value
complicated collateral
my biggest concerns are the ideas as president lacker put it that were subsidizing foreign
banks without really doing anything to mitigate hazard  i think that roughly translates what he said
which gets me to the point of president pooles comment  we have to be mindful of the risk of
being perceived as 1 helping a limited number of very large money center banks and 2 bailing
out the europeans  now we understand that  i dont think the public understands that  if you look
at my discount window there are five banks that could meet these collateral requirements the
63 million minimum  some districts have less some districts have more  our backbone at the
federal reserve in terms of our political support is the community banking system  to be sure we
all understand that we have systemic responsibilities but the idea that we might be facilitating these
huge institutions or bailing out the europeans is just a risk i think we need to be aware of and if
we proceed were going to have to figure out how to manage that
im not against a swap line another point that president lacker made  usually i would
expect president lacker to be against a swap line but hes not against the swap line  im not
against the swap line  it does beg the question of whether we couldnt do a swap line and work with
the existing facility but for the fact that we think that the existing facility is insufficient  again i
would present this if we proceed as a refinement
mr chairman i would like more time to think about this  im grateful that youre giving us
more time to think about it and i again would like to consider the governance aspects of it  but
those are the questions that i have at this juncture  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  its a very creative proposal and i agree
basically with the comments that president rosengren and governor kroszner said about it  its
important that the collateral be appropriate and well established and its definitely better if we dont
have simply a small number of borrowers  its also important we know that we hit our funds rate
target because this is you know tied to the effective federal funds rate  so if were really soft on
that then its going to be an even better opportunity for everyone  but as i think about it it seems
as though this is an opportunity to narrow the spread to 10 basis points instead of the 50 basis points
that we actually have on the discount window except for the eligibility requirements  so i can
support this as a temporary facility but im glad that were going to have more time to think about
it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  i too want to congratulate the staff on a creative proposal  i think i
need more time to think about this but let me offer just to some degree speculative remarks
theyre speculative because it has been a few years since ive even been around a treasury of a
money center bank but i do think i have some feel for it  first looking at it from the market
perspective lengthening the maturity of liabilities and then in train assets is desirable  clearly that
will assist financial stability which is our objective here  the subobjectives are to reduce stigma
and to unstick the market from its shortterm orientation
so i try to put myself in the shoes of a bank treasurer thinking about whether or not to use
such a facility  the way that large bank treasuries work or at least worked when i was close to
them is that you have essentially what is called an mco or maximum cumulative outflow
schedule which is a schedule of liability maturities going out for 360 days or more  todays picture
on the marginthat is to say in the money markets noncore deposits the things basically where
banks are funding themselves on the marginspikes very early  its dramatically early and then it
tails off and it seems to me that the treasurer would think about this by asking what mco gain do
i get from using this  it is just a matter of daysmaybe two or three days not twentyeight
because youre just adding it to a mix of liabilities that you already have  the offset of that would
be the reaction of the market the stigma question as they perceive a bank using thisthat is
whether there would be some countervailing reaction  its probably not insignificant no matter how
hard we try that when you use the lender of last resort as a funding source you are using the lender
of last resort as a funding source  so if i were a treasurer i would be making a kind of calculation
as to whether i was really gaining from an mco point of view any significant comfort relative to
the direction i thought the market was going
my own hope is that this issue will improve dramatically in the second half of october
this week and next week i believe we are going to go through the brokerdealer disclosures and
then in midoctober well get the large bank and other bank disclosures and the market
transparency should improve it seems to me reasonably strongly in that period  so it is
conceivable that well have different circumstances in the second half of october regarding the
markets being so terribly short term at this time  so again i am trying to think this through as a
treasurer would think it and i think there are some market dynamic considerations that a treasurer
would have to think about which suggests maybe not using it except in really extreme market
circumstances
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  my inclination after reading the memo over
the weekend was to be supportive of the proposal  however given some of the comments that ive
heard from my colleagues today i welcome the additional time to think about some of the concerns
especially some of the issues that president rosengren raised about only five institutions borrowing
i have some of the same concerns that president hoenig raised about whether introducing a
proposal like this during these times really does address the stigma issue  then the memo also
raises the issue that there is a risk that such a program would exacerbate the moral hazard problem
and im concerned about this  but i heard a lot of comments today around this table that in terms
of financial stress its critical that we do the right thing and play the appropriate central bank role
so again i like other comments that were made earlier  we have a great staff a skilled staff which
came up with a very creative proposal and my inclination is to support it  i am pleased that we
have the additional time to think about some of these issues so that i can better understand some of
the concerns that were raised  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  actually i do have some sympathy for this
proposal  i think it is very creative  but there are a lot more people around this table who know a
lot more details about this market how it works and how treasurers work than i do and i will
certainly defer to their judgment  but i have a couple of points that id like to make  president
hoenig made the point that really gives me a little pause as i absorb this  what im really worried
about is the law of unintended consequences and i dont know what they are right now  many of
you around the table have raised some possibilities that this could exacerbate  i think president
pooles suggestion about creating a tension between large and small banks about who has access to
this could prove to be a problem  i also agree that it might be unusual but it would be troubling if
in fact we ended up lending money in this facility going below the targeted funds rate which would
be maybe unlikely but would complicate our lives in other dimensions as well
i also worry a bit as i look at the marketand this probably has more generally to do with
provisions of liquiditythat part of the problem here is price discovery  who has the risk  where
are the risks how much are they and how do we price them  i worry a bit too about the degree to
which providing liquidity shuts down or slows down the pricediscovery process which is
something that we really want to get done  i dont know how to answer that question but its one
that i just sort of struggle with in trying to think about whether we are hampering the process of
price discovery by slowing it down and making it easier for people or are we moving it along at a
faster rate  i dont know the answer to that
the last point i think is more of a policy question  again president hoenig i think made
it  if we view this as a temporary tool which i think is fine it is important that we lay out in our
own minds under what circumstances in the future we would decide whether or not to implement
this tool and how we decide  what criteria do we have  we need something a little more objective
than just whenever we want to  i worry a bit that by failing to do so we will abandon some
expectations about how the market will react to this and when they might expect us to use it or not
do i know what the consequences of that will be  i dont know  im struggling with those
kinds of questions so having a little more time to think through some of these things would be very
helpful  those are my comments  thank you
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well at this time my bottom line on this
proposal is that its okay but im not altogether enthusiastic  its okay because i think having
another arrow in our quiver is not a bad idea and so to have done the work and put this forward
strikes me as clearly constructive  im not enthusiastic because i didnt find the case for it that
compelling and let me elaborate on that a minute  i probably would have thought it more
compelling a week or two ago but the markets seemed to be working a bit better and i think its to
our advantage to let that unfold assuming it continues to do so  more broadly i think theres a
question of whether the pricing that were seeing in the term funding market is something that we
really should be addressing  maybe given all the concerns and everything else that pricing is
perfectly fine at the moment and will adjust over time to something more normal without any action
on our part  if so that would strike me as preferable  but the real question for me at the end of the
day is that it seems as though the ultimate justification for something like this has to be related to
our macroeconomic objectives  do we believe that say a malfunctioning in the shortterm funding
market is going to have significant macroeconomic consequences  is it going to make the economy
behave significantly worse than perhaps the economy otherwise would have behaved  my answer
to that is perhaps but i dont really have a real conviction about that  so thats why i come out at
the moment anyway with yeah this could turn out to be useful but its hard for me to get really
enthusiastic about it
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think this is aimed at addressing a serious
problem that im afraid were losing sight of a bit  the pilingup of financing in very short term
vehicles is an issue for financial stability  partly this is yes the term rates are elevated and if this
were just a risk premium on certain counterparties i dont think that would be a big deal  but i do
feel that there has been a malfunctioning in the markets  as is typical in a financial crisis or panic
people have fled toward liquidity and safety in treasury bills and overnight lending and the normal
arbitrage that happens across markets just isnt happening  its great that the markets seem to be
getting better but if they continue to malfunction or if it gets worse again i think theres a serious
problem  the problem is that all these banks are being financed in the oneday to fourday area and
it leaves them open to huge rollover risk and huge liquidity risk  in turn because they have this
risk theyre more reluctant to lend  theyre more reluctant to use all that capital that you saw in the
chart the other day  so it is having a potential macroeconomic effect and i completely agree with
president stern  we would do it because theres a macroeconomic effect and because there is a
financial stability effect  but i think there is an issue here that we cant shrug off
i agree that the facility would attract those banks that need it most  thats what auctions do
right  thats why theyre designed that way and i think thats fine  for the most part with one
exception thats the way it would have the maximum effect of relieving some of these issues  you
bring in the folks who need it the most and it relieves some of their problems  that is a problem
regarding the borderline institutions that people have been talking about and if an institution is in
transition from being sound to being not sound this is an issue  its an issue for two reasons  one
is that it could facilitate the runoff of uninsured liability holders and the congress has told us not to
do that and we shouldnt do it  thats a moral hazard problem  the second is that it might allow
the banks that arent being run well to make that last betto do some other things that would put
them at greater risk  but i think those would be very very rare institutions that are in that kind of
spot where theyre just placing the final bet before going out of business  so the borderline
institution is a bit of a problem but im not sure its as big a problem as others have said
i think this would have a chance of success  there are no guarantees  i absolute agree
when arbitrage isnt working you have very strong preferred habitats  people want to lend short
and other people want to borrow long and the fed would be stepping into that breach in some sense
where the markets arent working  we would be supplying treasury bills and to a certain extent
doing matched salepurchases or reverse rps or whatever they call them these days borrowing
from the public at the very short term and we would be extending the term credit  in a sense we
would be stepping in for the arbitrage thats not happening and that would relieve pressures on
these markets at least a little  it has a chance of having some secondround effects of helping those
banks that want to use their capital do so more than they are already  so no guarantees  i dont
know that it would remove the stigma  as i said i think the auction process making it a totally
separate discount window and having the long period over which it has to happen makes it look
very very different from a discount rate loan
on the moral hazard issue of course this isnt doing anything really to relieve people who
made subprime loans  its not going to change the price of those assets so its not really affecting
that in any moral hazard way  its not aimed at individual institutions  its more like open market
operations than it is like the old form of discount window lending  even when normal functioning
is restored to markets banks will be paying for the liquidity insurance that they wrote  theres no
relief on the credit side  theyll still have to tie up capital making good on the liquidity insurance
forgoing moreprofitable opportunities  it would reduce perhaps at least a little around the edges
the extra cost of financing this liquidity insurance that they sold that comes from the disruption of
the markets from the fire sale aspect  i think that if we thought that the markets werent improving
and it would have a feedback effect on financial stability stepping in would be worthwhile  thats
the classic central bank thing to doto step in and relieve some of the extra panicky pressures on
the markets to get them functioning again  so i guess i dont see an important moral hazard issue
or to the extent that there is a moral hazard issue i think it would be more than offset by the
benefits to the macroeconomy of the functioning of financial markets should we decide that this
were needed if those markets werent working  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  very briefly when i think back about a week
ago to maybe one of the darker days that weve had in the past six weeks there were so many more
institutions that were funding themselves on an overnight basis that it wouldnt take much
imagination for us to get very fearful very soon if there were some kind of shock that made it
impossible or much more difficult for them to fund themselves twentyfour hours later  so i think
the acf would have held great promise then to be useful in addressing some of the headline risks
that could very quickly have had systemic implications  i think the acf holds great promise now
ill highlight only one question which is timing  i share the view put forth by president
stern that to the extent we see these markets improving on their own terms which is something
weve seen in recent trading days we wouldnt want to do anything to stop that momentum  if we
had hit the button today it may well be that they would have had to take stock of this new
instrument and compare it to the other alternatives they have and that improvement could have
potentially been delayed  on the other hand if we wait until these markets deteriorate to where they
were a week ago the efficacy of hitting the button then would also be less than ideal  so my own
sense on timingand its something that the chairman will i think brief us all on if we get to that
pointis to the extent that we see that momentum has stopped and we see the ground weakening
below us then we might have to make a riskadjusted call at that point  i dont think it will be a
very easy or a very apparent one  but on balance i think that the macroeconomic possibilities are
pretty scary which makes me suggest that we would lean forward on this  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i also want to congratulate the staff  this is a
very clever and targeted intervention and its a very nicely put together proposal  im supportive  i
think its something thats good to have available  im glad that were not planning to put it in place
instantly  it does have the potential to address the stigma issues that banks have coming to the
discount window  really the spike in the spread between term and overnight loans in the interbank
market has been quite sizable and its obvious that that has been complicating the difficulties that
banks have had in managing liquidity
i have also been concerned given how many other borrowing rates are linked to libor
that if the spread remains elevated it has the potential to spill over into the rates that a lot of
borrowers pay  i think this has a chance in succeeding and reducing that spread and bringing
libor down but its not 100 percent obvious to me that it will succeed  i think it does depend on
your interpretation of exactly what that spread represents whether its credit risk or liquidity risk
as i read the proposal i thought it really didnt make the case in a powerful way to me that
the inability of banks to fund at term was creating systemic risk  it seems to me that given a
proposal of this magnitude that involves coordinating central bank intervention and has a chance of
not succeeding we ought to be doing it to address something that we regard as an important
systemic risk  the comments that governors kohn and warsh made have convinced me as we
have discussed this that there could very well be systemic risks here and that we might if things get
worse again want to put this into place  so i found that discussion very useful  it seemed to me
that the case that was actually made in the document in a sense was more a monetary policy case
that banks facing these funding pressures would likely raise rates and that would have
macroeconomic consequences  that then suggests to me well why dont we use the federal funds
rate more  it is a more general tool to remove those pressures
i share the concern that we will be perceived as bailing out a small set of weak institutions
including washington mutual countrywide and others that may be associated with the crisis
especially if were using this overnight index swap rate  it has been sitting here i guess around
480 476 or something like that which if we had had this facility in effect would be below the
funds rate and would raise questions about why we were lending so cheaply  one way or another i
would certainly be happy to approve a swap agreement with the european central bank and the
swiss national bank to provide them with dollar funding whether we go ahead or not if thats
desirable
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i think that this proposal has an important advantage in that it is
channeling funds to a place where they are most needed so it has macroeconomic consequences  if
you think about it open market operations are a very blunt tool  here you are actually able to direct
credit to a market that isnt working  we have a libor market that really is not working it clearly
has spreads that are way out of line  when people talk about whats going on in the market they
basically say yes theres an arbitrage opportunity but theres so much risk that i cant take
advantage of it  that is something that i think is important  for example my understanding of
commercial real estate deals is that all the deals are done off of libor and so this actually is an
important market  do i think this will solve the problem of price discovery in general  no  but i
do think that this is an important market that is having important macroeconomic implications and
going in and doing something about it can have very strong benefits
there are some tricky issues  the issue i really worry about the most is the 20 percent
number where we might have five guys and everybody knows that some people will be politically
problematic for us  so maybe you might want to think about whether that 20 percent number is
exactly the best number  thats why i was going to ask the same question that you asked and now
that we have some time i would encourage the staff to think about exactly that issue
another element here is importantwhich is that were saying to the marketplace that
were not just thinking about using monetary policy tools in fact because it is a credit problem
were thinking creatively about how to use credit tools as well  in that regard theres an advantage
that we are thinking outside the box and trying to deal with this another way  let me give you an
analogy to something that we did on august 17  on august 17 we pulled out the discount window
we did it with a 50 basis point penalty  you know you look at it and in one sense it was not a
success  it didnt make a big difference in terms of the numbers  it wasnt bad but ill tell you
when you asked people out there whether it was a positive thing to do theyd say oh yeah  it
really sent a very very good signal  my sense is that this may not completely solve the problem
there are some issues about how much should be taken upbut i think that it would send a signal
that were on the ball  it has another element which im a bit sensitive to that there is criticism that
we are too academic here because some of us have worn tweed coats  laughter  so that you
know the chairman used to come to the new york fed meetings and would wear those patches on
the outside of his coat  i actually like that look and have my assistant professor corduroy suit  but
here we are trying to think very practically in a creative way  it also has an advantage for this
institution at this juncture because we are thinking about market issues and dealing with very
specific details in the markets  i think thats something that weve gotten across to some extent
were ready and i think this would help  so im not saying absolutely that we definitely should use
this but i think governor warsh talked about this exactly right  if were seeing that theres some
stalling that these spreads are not improving then this is an option that will have benefits  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  just a few quick things  first i should say that the
concerns and questions you all put on the table are the right set of concerns and questions  some of
them can be resolved by tweaking the design of things but some of them we will not be able to
resolve with changes in design and well have to decide whether or not we want to live with those
things  i think its important to recognize that even though weve had ten days of pretty steady
improvement in the willingness and ability of financers to differentiate across different sets of
institutions and different sets of instruments et cetera and the process is encouraging we should
not take too much comfort from that yet  this process could go on for some time we are still in a
quite fragile situation and the situation could get more fragile again easily and quite quickly  we
may need at that point to escalate in terms of the range of things that were prepared to do in that
context  we need to be very open to thinking about practical creative ways to address some of the
limitations not just in our tools and the relative stigma attached to them but in the tools of the other
central banks in the major financial centers  we now exist with a very complicated set of
limitations and asymmetries in those limitations and i think that mix together does not leave us
optimally positioned or with the flexibility to deal with the kinds of things were facing in these
markets  so its going to require that we be open practical and creative in thinking through the
optimal way to navigate through those kinds of things  it would be very hard to know outside the
circumstance what hierarchy of choices is going to look most appealing to uswhether in the event
the swap alone would be ideal or feasible whether something at the discount window alone would
be ideal or feasible or some other things would be  its just hard to know
but i think you have to recognize that were all going to be in a world of second third or
fourth best just because nothing looks terrific now relative to those problems  we are not going to
be able to clarify for ourselves fully what the effect might be and whether we can manage some of
the risk of unintended consequences not just in terms of future incentives but also in terms of
signaling effect  im sure we all know that  but some of the things that you raise today we would
face in the moment and would not be able to resolve definitively  it is also true that we may need to
move very quickly  we may not have a lot of time and we may need to do something multilateral
just because even though this has a lot of manifestations in dollar funding markets its not solely a
dollar issue and its obviously not solely and maybe not even principally a funding issue around
us financial institutions  so we may need to be open to doing something together  that will of
course mean we may need to compromise in terms of what may be optimal for our optics or for our
design of the economics of the thing  so i think those of you who welcomed the fact that you
would have more time to think through this shouldnt take too much time  this may be a situation
in which you will have to resolve your ambivalence quickly  you may not be able to resolve it
chairman bernanke  so thank you very much  i appreciated this discussion a great
deal  i did not hear a great deal of opposition to the principle that the federal reserve at times
should help markets function when they are in a state of panic or otherwise in serious dysfunction
so in that respect i think that this is the kind of tool that under some circumstances might prove
quite useful  you did raise a large number of practical issues political issues optical issues and so
on  you all said that you wanted to think about it and im going to take you up on that  please
think about it  please consult with your staffs and then let me to please ask our staffs in new york
and washington to see if some of these issues can be addressed and let us continue to think about
under what circumstances this might be useful  you know just because you have a hammer doesnt
mean that every problem is a nail right  laughter  so we do need to think further about the
circumstances under which this kind of intervention would improve market functioning and reduce
financial stress in an appropriate way  fortunately it does not appear that we need to act today  but
as vice chairman geithner points out markets are fragile and the possibility that we might come
back to you in three days or a week or two weeks or whatever should not be discounted  so thank
you very much for your comments
the next meeting is october 30 and 31 a twoday meeting and we will also have cathy
minehans farewell lunch at that meeting  thank you again  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
