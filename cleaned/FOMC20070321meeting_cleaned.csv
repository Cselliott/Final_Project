transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of march 2021 2007
march 20 2007afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  let me be the first to welcome
dennis lockhart sitting in for the federal reserve bank of atlanta  well start with bill dudley
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  financial markets have become much more turbulent since the last meetingespecially in subprime mortgages and associated securities in us and global equities and in foreign exchange markets the good news is that markets have generally remained liquid and well functioning with a minor exception on the new york stock exchange on february 27  moreover there are few signs of significant contagion from the subprime mortgage market into the rest of the mortgage market or from subprime mortgage credit spreads to corporate credit spreads more generally  in general the debt markets have been mostly unruffled by recent developments
i plan to focus my attention on four major market developments  first the substantial turmoil in the subprime mortgage marketi talked about the risk that this market might unravel at the january fomc meeting that certainly occurred more quickly and more forcefully than i anticipated  second i want to talk a little about the decline in us equity prices and the accompanying rise in actual and implied price volatility  third is the sharp correction in the socalled carry trade in foreign exchange markets  the low interest rate currencies such as the yen and the swiss franc have appreciated with the greatest moves coming against their higheryielding counterparts  finally ill talk a bit about the sharp downward shift in market expectations about the path of the federal funds rate target over the next year and a half  two key questions motivate my comments  first is the market turbulence driven mainly by fundamental developments or does it reflect mainly a shift in the risk appetite of investors  second what is the ongoing risk of contagion from the market area that has experienced the most stressthe subprime mortgage marketto other markets
regarding the subprime mortgage market the deterioration appears driven mostly by fundamental developments  as you know the delinquency rates for subprime adjustablerate mortgages have risen sharply  in contrast as shown in exhibit 1 of the handout there has been little change in delinquency rates for fixedrate mortgages
most significantly delinquency rates for the 2006 vintage of subprime adjustablerate mortgages have climbed unusually quickly  as shown in exhibit 2 the last vintage that went this bad so fast was the 2001 vintage and that had a much different economic environmentone characterized by a mild recession and a rising unemployment rate  the deterioration in the quality of subprime mortgage credit has led to a sharp widening in credit spreads for the abx indexes  the abx indexes

1  material used by mr dudley is appended to this transcript appendix 1
represent the cost of default protection on a basket of collateralized debt obligations that are backstopped mainly by subprime mortgages  as shown in exhibit 3 although this widening has been most pronounced at the bottom end of the credit quality spectrum bbbminus and bbb it has rippled upward to the higherrated tranches that are better protected  exhibit 4 shows how the credit deterioration initially registered in the abx indexes as market participants sought to buy protection  in milder form this deterioration also registered in the underlying collateralized debt obligations and assetbacked securities  the widening of the credit spread in the abx indexes was probably exaggerated by the fact that there was an asymmetry between the many that were seeking loss protection and the few that were willing to write protection  this can be seen in two ways  first as shown in exhibit 4 the spread widening was more pronounced in the abx index than in either underlying collateralized debt obligations or assetbacked securities  second as shown in exhibit 3 the abx spreads have come down a bit from their peaks even as the underlying market for subprime mortgages as reflected in the ongoing viability of many mortgage originators has continued to deteriorate
the deterioration in the subprime market has undermined the economics of subprime mortgage origination and securitization  this is especially true for those mortgage originators with poorer underwriting track records  their loans can no longer be sold at a sufficient premium to par value to cover their origination costs  in addition the costs that they must incur to replace loans that have defaulted early have increased sharply  in several cases these difficulties have caused banks to pull their warehouse lines of credit  several of the large monoline originators are bankrupt distressed or up for salethey are highlighted in red in exhibit 5  moreover several of the diversified lenders such as hsbc have indicated that they are tightening credit standards and pulling back from this sector  the result is that the volume of subprime mortgage originations is likely to fall sharply this yearperhaps dropping onethird or more from the 2006 rate of slightly more than 600 billion  this tightening of credit availability to subprime borrowers is likely to manifest itself through a number of channels  these channels include 1 a drop in housing demand as borrowers who would have been able to get credit in 2006 no longer qualify under now toughened underwriting standards 2 an increase in housing supply as the rate of housing foreclosures increases notably the mortgage bankers association reported last week that the rate of loans entering the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter of 2006 reached a record level of 054 percent the highest level in the history of the thirtysevenyearold survey and 3 additional downward pressure on home prices which in turn threatens to increase the magnitude of credit problems delinquencies and foreclosures
in considering these channels it is important to emphasize that the credit strains in the subprime sector are unlikely to have peaked yet  the reset risk on the adjustablerate portion of the subprime loans originated in 2005 and 2006 will be felt mainly over the remainder of 2007 and 2008  most of the adjustablerate loans are fixed for two years at low teaser rates  when yields adjust upward once the teaser rate period is over some borrowers may have insufficient resources to service these
debts  the good newsat least to dateis that spillover into the alta mortgage and conforming mortgage areas is very mild both in terms of credit spreads and in terms of loan performance  although there has been some rise in delinquency and foreclosure rates for higherquality residential mortgages these rates are still low both qualitatively and historically  moreover there is little evidence that the subprime problems have hurt mortgage loan volumes  for example the mortgage bankers association index of mortgage applications for purchase has increased in the past three weeks
turning next to the us equity market it is less clearcut whether the decline in prices and the rise in volatility are fundamentally based  as several observers have noted equity valuations do not appear to be excessive  if that is the case then why have equities been more turbulent than corporate and emergingmarket debt for which spreads remain unusually narrow  although this point is legitimate two fundamental developments that make us equity prices less attractive deserve mention  first equity analysts have been reducing their earnings forecasts for 2007 although the topdown view of the equity strategists for the sp 500 index has not changed much on a bottomup basis earnings expectations have dropped sharply
as shown in exhibit 6 the aggregate forecasts of the individual sector analysts now indicate a growth rate in sp 500 earnings for 2007 of about 6 percent down from about 9 percent at the beginning of the year  in contrast sp 500 earnings have grown at an annual rate of more than 10 percent for four consecutive years  it should be no surprise that falling earnings expectations could weigh on equity prices
second uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased  this shows up clearly for example in our most recent primary dealer survey  because greater uncertainty about the growth outlook presumably implies greater risk the rise in uncertainty shouldall else being equalresult in lower share prices  in contrast it is easier to explain the modest widening of corporate credit spreads  in theory lower share prices and higher volatility imply a greater risk of default which should imply wider credit spreads  corporate credit spreads have behaved in a manner consistent with this  josh rosenberg from the research group at the federal reserve bank of new york recently investigated this issue  he found that the spread widening in the high yield corporate debt sector was consistent with past periods in which the implied volatility for equities rose sharply  exhibit 7 summarizes one key result  the widening in the bbrated corporate spreads in the week after the february 27 retrenchment was of a magnitude similar to that of other instances in which implied equityprice volatility as measured by the vix index rose sharply  in the most recent episode the vix index rose 848 basis points and the bb corporate spread rose
27 basis points  this rise compares with an average rise of 21 basis points in the bb spread in the ten cases in which the vix rose most sharply  the rise in the most recent episode is well within the range of historical experience

in many other areas in which asset prices have moved sharply riskreduction efforts appear to have played the biggest role  for example in the foreign exchange markets the biggest currency moves were in the currency pairs associated with so called carry trades such as the yen and swiss franc for the lowyielding currencies
and the australian and new zealand dollar for the high yielders  exhibit 8 indicates the change in the yen versus the australian dollar the new zealand dollar the euro the british pound and the us dollar during three separate periodsthe week before the february 27 stock market selloff the week of the stock market selloff and the past two weeks  the highyielding currencies appreciated the most during the runup to the february 27 selloff fell the most during the february 27 week and have recovered the most against the yen over the past two weeks  the changes in speculative positioning in foreign exchange future markets tell a similar story
exhibit 9 shows the change in the share of the open interest position held by participants in the noncommercial futures market  over the past few weeks net short positions as a percentage of the overall open interest in the yen have dropped and long positions in the british pound and australian dollar have dropped
an examination of how treasury yields stock prices exchange rates and credit spreads have moved also indicates that riskreduction efforts have been important exhibit 10 shows the correlation of daily price and yield movements in 2007 before february 27  as one can see the correlations were quite low  in contrast the correlation matrix in exhibit 11 shows the correlation of daily price moves for the period beginning on february 27  most of the correlations have climbed sharply suggesting that risk positioning is driving price and yield movements
finally shortterm interest rate expectations have shifted substantially since the last fomc meeting  as shown in exhibit 12 nearterm expectations have shifted with market participants now expecting a modest reduction in the federal funds rate target by late summer  however the federal funds rate futures curve is still above the curve at the time of the december fomc meeting  in contrast longerterm expectations have shifted more sharply with a larger move toward easing  as shown in exhibit 13 the june 2008june 2007 eurodollar calendar spread is now inverted by about 60 basis points  this calendar spread is more inverted than it was at the time of the december 2006 fomc meeting
compared with the shift in market expectations the forecasts of primary dealers have not changed much  exhibits 14 and 15 compare dealer expectations with market expectations before the january fomc meeting and before this meeting  the horizontal bold lines represent market expectations  the blue circles represent the different dealer forecasts  the green circles represent the average dealer forecast for each period  the two exhibits illustrate several noteworthy points  first the average dealer forecast has not changed much since the january fomc meetingthe green circles in the two charts are in virtually the same position  second the amount of dispersion among the dealers forecasts has not changed muchin fact the range of the blue circles is slightly narrower currently  although many dealers now mention that their uncertainty about the growth outlook has increased that does not appear to have been reflected in their modal forecasts  third there is now a substantial gap between the dealers average forecast and market expectationsthe gap between the horizontal bold lines which represent market expectations and the green circles which represent the average dealers view has increased  why is there a large gap
between the dealers forecasts and market expectations   i think there are three major explanations  first the dealers forecasts are modal forecasts and do not reflect the downside risks that many dealers now believe have emerged in the growth outlook
second dealer forecasts often lag behind economic and market developments  only when downside risks grow big enough to pass some threshold are dealers likely to alter their modal forecasts  third some of the downward shift in market expectations may represent riskreduction efforts  an investor with speculative risk positions that would be vulnerable to economic weakness might hedge these risks by buying eurodollar futures contracts  this hedging could push the implied yields on eurodollar futures contracts lower than what would be consistent with an unbiased forecast of the likely path of the federal funds rate
nevertheless the potential gap between market expectations and the committees interest rate expectations may pose a bit of a conundrum for the committee  if the committee were to shift the bias of its statement in the direction of neutral market expectations with respect to easing would undoubtedly be pulled forward and might become more pronounced  after all most dealers expect that the committee will not change the inflation bias of the january fomc statement  in contrast keeping the bias unchanged in order to keep market expectations from shifting further in the easing direction might be inconsistent with the committees assessment of the relative risks regarding growth and inflation  if the committee were to keep the bias unchanged even when its views had changed the communication process might be impaired
on a housekeeping note i wish to bring to the committees attention the changes to the morning call with the trading desk  they were discussed in a memo distributed to the committee last week  under the new format which we plan to implement on thursday the call will be open to all members of the committee and you will have the option of participating in the 910 am discussion of reserve management issues the 920 am portion covering recent developments in global markets or both portions  the march 15 memo outlines the new procedures for joining these calls  finally there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the january fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for bill either about the
outlook or the housekeeping matter  president fisher
mr fisher  bill you talked about subprime mortgages in some detail but not about alta
mortgages in great detail  my understanding is and i just want to check to see whether im correct
that 20 percent of the 2006 purchasedollar originations were alta roughly the same percentage as
subprime  its my further understanding that 81 percent of the alta originations were no
documentation or lowdocumentation loans  how much confidence do you haveand i can tell by
your reaction that theres a questionthat alta mortgages are not as perilous as subprimes  if you
dont have confidence or if they are perilous what consequences might ensue
mr dudley  well unfortunately the information on the alta market is not very good
in fact there is disagreement about exactly what an alta mortgage is  if you cant define it its
pretty hard to measure  that is problem number one  a good way of thinking about the mortgage
market is as a continuum of loan quality extending from at the bottom the worst underwritten
subprime mortgages that are adjustable rate up to the conforming mortgages that we always
associate with the gses with alta somewhere in the middle  obviously to the extent that the
housing market deteriorates and home prices dont go up there will be more strain on the alta
market but i dont get a sense that we will see the kind of underwriting problems that we have seen
in the subprime mortgage area  as of this date we dont see a lot of evidence of a significant
problem in that area but again we dont have very good information and well have to wait and
see
mr fisher  may i ask of bill mr chairman that we continue the analysis on this front
and keep probing
mr dudley  absolutely
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  this is a continuation of the same question because i was intrigued by
your chart that shows 2006 sixtyday and over delinquencies for subprime arms tracking with
2001  i dont recall the world as we know it coming to an end in the subprime market in 2001 but i
also wonder how big the subprime market was and how much it might have been characterized by
some of the rather difficult practices that we know went on particularly from the middle of 06
through the end of the year
mr dudley  youre absolutely right  the market was much smaller at that time  i
would characterize the deterioration that you saw in 2001 as probably mostly driven by the
macroeconomy and the deterioration that you saw in 2006 as driven mostly by two things  more
laxity in the underwriting process and a change in the trajectory of home prices  so i think the
causes of the deterioration in the two cases were quite different  the subprime mortgage market in
2006 is several times the size of the originations in 2001 so obviously it will have a bigger
consequence
chairman bernanke  president geithner
vice chairman geithner  you made a distinction at the beginning between
something that was fundamental and something that was about a change in risk perception  just
conceptually how do you distinguish between those two things  is the latter something that you
cant attribute to a change in observable economic conditions
mr dudley  the distinction id make between fundamentals and risk reduction is that
the latter occurs when people adjust their portfolios not because they change their view about the
quality of a particular asset but because they are reducing the amount of risk exposure to the market
that they want to have  so when you have a big event like february 27 obviously volatility goes
up and so value at risk goes up and you may decide to reduce your risk  so youre going to sell all
sorts of things and the prices of those things you sell will go down regardless of whether youve
actually changed your opinion about them in any meaningful way  why did corn prices on
february 27 fall 2 percent  it was probably because corn prices had been in a big bull market
people had risk positions in corn and so they wanted to get out of those positions
vice chairman geithner  i guess my question is how do you know
mr dudley  you dont
vice chairman geithner  you dont know  thank you
mr dudley  you dont know with certainty  you make an inference
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i follow up
chairman bernanke  yes
vice chairman geithner  bill one of the factors you said that might account for
the gap between the primary dealer expectations about the fed funds rate at different horizons and
the average market pricing might be the flight to quality  its not quite a flight to quality but it
reflects the demand for safer assets
mr dudley  or assets that would do well in a bad economic environment as a hedge to
the rest of your risk
vice chairman geithner  a flight to liquidity or something like that  do you think
the same story might account for what happened in far forward interest rates in the treasury market
as well  would you say that perhaps the same kind of phenomenon might account for that
mr dudley  going out on the curve to ten years its possible  the eurodollar market is
probably the most liquid market in which one could do this very very quickly  so i guess i would
view what happened in the longerdated treasuries is probably more reflective of emerging
downside risk to the economy but theres probably some of the flight to liquidity as well  i think
its hard to tell
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  what institutional or quantitative constraints are there on traders who
would be positioned to take the other side of the movement into eurodollar futures for the hedging
operation  you paint a picture of everyone knowing that the fed funds rate path is above whats
implied by eurodollar futures and of no one being able to pan that out of the market
mr dudley  well another explanation is that the economists who make the dealer
forecasts are not the traders who execute the eurodollar futures positions  so thats a possible
alternative explanation  generally theres a disequilibrium  a number of people that ive talked to
in the markets have said that this is what they thought was going on and they advised me not to take
what was going on in the eurodollar futures markets literally because they felt that some of them
were putting on these positions in case of a bad scenario that led to significant reductions in short
term interest rates  so im basically taking the explanation somewhat on the advice of market
participants who told me that they were doing this
mr lacker  let me just follow up  i look at eurodollar futures every day  youre an
experienced savvy market guy and i want to learn how to understand these markets  my
presumption would be that if that takes place theres something limiting the capital of people who
could take the offsetting position  how could markets be so out of whack for so long
vice chairman geithner  let me just say for the record that i dont think bill is
saying that the market is mispricing the value
mr lacker  i thought that was clearly what he said
vice chairman geithner  i think he is just saying that the primary dealers whom
we survey who are a strange group laughter have a view thats somewhat different from the view
of the markets
mr lacker  no he said that people told him not to take the eurodollar price as
indicative of the expected value of the eurodollar rate at that date  is that what you were saying
you said disequilibrium  im trying to understand how financial markets work here
mr dudley  when people are in riskreduction mode they dont want to take on more
risk  so there may be an imbalance temporarily between those who want to hedge versus those who
want to take more risk  to take the other side of that bet theyre basically increasing their risk  the
abx market is another example of that  why did the abx index go to a 2000 yield spread  well
it was partly because a lot more people wanted to buy protection in the subprime mortgage market
than wanted to sell it  in a perfect economic world it should be arbitraged away but i think there
are cases where that just doesnt necessarily happen
mr reinhart  i think its the other point president lacker about how much
confidence you put in the green dots which are the survey of to use the vice chairmans words
that strange group that the new york fed contacts
mr lacker  this isnt about the green dots  this is about the eurodollar
mr reinhart  no no no  because primary dealers economists quite often probably
are reporting their modal forecast because theyre telling a story about where the committee was
going forward and painting an overall picture of the economy whereas the eurodollar contracts
reflect averaging across all the states of nature  what we see when we look at options is a growing
downside tail  so it could be the emergence of that significant downside tail which economists will
talk about as a risk to their outlook but traders actually have to price as another reason that those
two things are diverging
mr lacker  thats helpful  but still apart from the green dots hes telling us theres
some mispricing thats systematic
mr dudley  its a possible explanation  vinces explanation which i made in fact in
my prepared remarks is probably one i would put a greater weight on
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  i just want to get back to the subprime market for a quick question
there have been a lot of newspaper stories about people who default on the first payment in
these mortgages which is a bit of a puzzle to me unless its just pure fraud  i was just
wondering if you had any information about whether there has been an increase in fraud here or
whether there are other reasons for people defaulting on the very first payment on their
mortgage
mr dudley  first a simple explanationi dont know if this is correctis that if
home prices are going up and youre getting 100 percent loan to value youre getting basically a
free option to see if the home prices will keep going up  if they dont go up you decide okay
thank you very much for your loan and im not going to make any payments  so probably some
people are speculating  certainly there have been anecdotal reports of investors who were doing
this  second there probably has been fraud  i mean there are examples of people who were
obtaining mortgages for other people when they werent the true beneficiaries of the loan
mr moskow  have you seen any data or hard evidence on this
mr dudley  no
mr moskow  thank you
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  actually michael the ceo of a large bank that originates mortgages
with whom i had a conversation commented that this indicator is a bit confusing because it has
to do with the fact that the owners of these loans change  by the time the person makes the first
payment it is a struggle to figure out to whom that payment goes  so the mortgage shows up as
default with the end owner but the person did make the payment  the payment just didnt get to
the right place  so the ceo said that we need to be careful about making too much of that
number because its more of an accounting issue than it is people actually defaulting on their first
payment
mr dudley  that is a fair point  in fact thats why we like to look at sixtydayplus
delinquencies and try to push people away from looking at thirty daysit takes time for the
payment to find the actual loan holder
ms pianalto  he mentioned that a number of 3 percent was attached to first
payments in default and that number is just way out of whack
chairman bernanke  i had been puzzled about the quantitative relationship
between the subprime problems and the stock market  i think that the actual money at risk is on
the order of 50 billion from defaults on subprimes which is very small compared with the
capitalization of the stock market  it looks as though a lot of the problem is coming from bad
underwriting as opposed to some fundamentals in the economy  so i guess im a bit puzzled
about whether its a signal about fundamentals or how its linked to the stock market
mr dudley  its hard to know how connected the subprime market and the stock
market have been in the past month or two  clearly people are nervous about the positive
feedback loops of less mortgage origination leading to less housing demand leading to lower
home prices leading to a weaker economyand then that feeding into corporate earnings and
disappointments on the corporate earnings side  i dont think any of us knows exactly how
powerful those linkages are but thats probably at least one element that equity investors are
worried about
chairman bernanke  does anyone have any questions about the call procedure
are there any other questions  then we need a vote to ratify domestic operations
ms minehan  so moved
speaker  second
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  its time for the economic
situation  dave stockton
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  on the whole the staff forecast has survived the economic news and financial events of the past seven weeks reasonably well  although we revised down our projection for the growth of real activity we dont really see the fundamentals of the economy as having changed significantly over the intermeeting period  indeed our forecast for the growth of real gdp for 2007 has been fluctuating in the 2 to 2 percent range since last august and this latest revision has only returned us to the lower end of that relatively narrow range  still ill admit that ive been experiencing something like the pangs of a nervous flier  for the most part my anxieties have been held in check by an economic ride that has proceeded relatively smoothly along the anticipated flight path  but each episode of turbulence seems to trigger the panicked thought that economies like planes really do crash from time to time  dont worry  i will spare you another episode of selfpsychoanalysis laughter loosen my grip on the  armrests and concentrate this afternoon on a dispassionate analysis of recent events and their implications for the economic outlook
i must say we have had some important developments with which to contend weaker economic data higher oil prices problems in subprime mortgage markets and a drop in equity valuations  among the weak reports one that was not a surprise to us was the downward revision in the beas estimate of fourthquarter gdp  as you will recall one of the major differences between our january forecast of a
2 percent increase in fourthquarter real gdp and the beas advance estimate of a 3 percent increase was their much higher figure for inventory investment  while i am certain that it was more luck than skill the incoming inventory data for the fourth quarter were very close to our expectations and far below the beas figures accounting for a sizable fraction of their downward revision to real gdp
that was important because a central element in our story is that although some inventory buildups have developed in recent months production adjustments are occurring promptly enough to prevent the emergence of a fullblown inventory cycle that could cause a period of subpar growth to morph into an economic downturn
inventorysales ratios rose noticeably over the second half of last year as the growth of final demand shifted down  the problems were most apparent in the motor vehicle industry  but aggressive cuts in motor vehicle assemblies in the second half of last year and early this year combined with a reasonably stable pace of sales in the neighborhood of 16 million units appear to have put this problem largely behind us judging by the increases in production scheduled for the second quarter the automakers seem to share that view  inventories also backed up in a wide variety of constructionrelated industries and substantial cuts in the production of construction supplies occurred in the fourth quarter  but we still see inventory problems lingering
here  more recently some signs of excess stockbuilding have extended beyond motor vehicles and construction supplies most notably in machinery electrical equipment appliances and furniture  as a consequence we expect manufacturing output to remain quite tepid in the first half of this year  that forecast seems consistent with the generally lackluster results from national and regional surveys of business activity  still we dont see the current situation as precipitating a cyclical downturn in aggregate activity  i offer that observation with some trepidation  for some reason i recall past humiliations more vividly than successes perhaps because they have occurred with much greater frequency  laughter  but i recall sitting here in the autumn of 2000 telling president poole that we did not see a serious inventory overhang in the tech sector  looking back on that episode it wasnt that we werent looking carefully enough at the data in hand rather we were led astray by our failure to anticipate how rapidly final demand for these goods would crumble
if you were inclined to worry on that score the recent data on final demand might not be encouraging as we have had more surprises to the downside than the upside in that regard one of the most noteworthy areas of downside surprise has been equipment spending  the january figures on orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods were weaker than we had expected and those readings came on the heels of considerable softness late last year  demand for hightechnology goods seems to have been well maintained and although transportation investment has been weak that had largely been expected  the principal surprise has been equipment investment outside hightech and transportation which now seems poised to fall about 7 percent at an annual rate this quarter after having fallen about 5 percent in the fourth quarterboth figures well below our earlier expectations  to be perfectly honest were not entirely sure what to make of the magnitude and extent of this softness in capital spending  we dont think that it is entirely a statistical mirage because we have seen a noticeable weakening in our industrial production measures of business equipment which for the most part are independent observations  to be sure much of the slowing has occurred for equipment related to the motor vehicle and construction industries  but just like the inventory data the recent information on capital spending suggests weakness beyond these two areas
our best guess is that businesses may have become a bit more cautious and possibly scaled back or put on hold some capital spending plans while they gauge the extent to which the economic landscape may have shifted over the past six months  if so it may be a while before those concerns fully abate accordingly we have marked down our forecast for the growth in real es in 2007 to 2 percent from the
5 percent pace we were projecting in january  we do however expect spending growth to pick back up to a rate of about 5 percent in 2008 only a bit below our previous forecast  we dont think a more aggressive adjustmentsuch as the one we highlighted as the business pessimism scenario in the greenbookis yet warranted financial conditions remain favorable corporate balance sheets generally look healthy capital spending surveys have been upbeat and business sentiment has softened a bit but not seriously sagged  we just dont see the preconditions for a serious retrenchment in capital spending in coming quarters
in addition to es spending the other major source of downward revision in our projection was housing  two factors led to the further downward adjustments that we made to our housing forecast  first the actual data on housing starts and building permits came in below our expectations in january and suggested to us that the pace of activity in coming quarters was likely to be more subdued than we had earlier expected  the data that we received this morning on starts and permits was a mixed bag  starts of singlefamily homes rose 10 percent in february in contrast to the
2 percent increase that we had projected  but adjusted permits a less noisy indicator of activity fell 2 percent last month close to our expectations  taken together the february readings have little consequence for our projection  the second factor weighing on our housing forecast was the rapid intensification of problems in the subprime market  in this projection we made an explicit adjustment to our forecast of sales and starts for what we now expect to be a significant pullback in nonprime originations in the period ahead  as we noted in the greenbook we estimate that the easing of lending standards may have elevated nonprime originations by an amount equal to 10 percent of total home sales in 2005 and 7 percent of sales in 2006  we have lowered the level of our forecast of starts and sales a further 3 percent to account for a more abrupt pullback in nonprime originations in the months ahead  this would be roughly consistent with a decline of about 35 percent in nonprime originations this year
in revising this aspect of our forecast we have assumed that the increase in foreclosures associated with subprime difficulties will have only a small negative effect on overall house prices  we take some comfort from the fact that futures prices on the caseshiller house price indexes have edged only slightly lower in the past couple of weeks as this issue gained attention  we have also assumed that there is little spillover from subprime difficulties into the prime portion of the market  we have for some time been assuming that as newly issued loans seasoned and as rates reset on adjustablerate mortgages some gradual deterioration would occur in loan performance and that is still our view  in sum the combination of the weaker incoming data and the problems in subprime lending led us to mark down our residential investment forecast enough to take about  percentage point off the growth of real gdp this year  obviously this area will require continued scrutiny in the period ahead
elsewhere in the household sector consumer spending has been coming in very close to our expectations  last weeks retail sales report was read by many as weak but it was right in line with our forecast  to be sure sales increases have trailed off  in recent months but that pattern is consistent with the marked slowing in consumption growth that we are forecasting for the second quarter  although the data have been in line with our expectations the fundamentals for consumer spending have weakened since the january greenbook  in particular the trajectory of oil prices is about 5 per barrel above our previous forecast and this should take a bite out of purchasing power going forward  in addition we now have equity prices running about 4 percent below our previous projection which along with slightly weaker
house prices suggests a bit less impetus to spending from wealth  all told real pce is expected to increase at an annual rate of 2 percent this year and next down about
 percentage point from our previous forecast
this might sound like a pretty gloomy report  but there have been some positives too  karen will discuss the external sector which is expected to be a smaller drag on output in this forecast compared with our previous one  also fiscal policy most notably defense spending seems likely to impart more impetus to growth than we had earlier expected  moreover the labor market continues to flash stronger signals than would be expected from an economy in which growth has slowed below the pace of its potential  the unemployment rate fell back to 45 percent in february and has been basically trendless since last fall  if payroll employment gains have slowed at all in recent months they have slowed just a bit there have been a few developments of late that hint of a slowing in labor demand initial claims have averaged a higher level in recent weeks and insured unemployment has moved up  moreover job losers unemployed less than five weeksa proxy for the layoff ratehave increased and surveys of hiring plans have turned a bit less positive  we still think a slowdown in labor demand will become more evident in the coming months but youve heard me say that before
in the end there were more minuses than pluses over this intermeeting period  and we marked down our forecast for the growth of real gdp by  percentage point both this year and next to 21 and 23 percent respectively  but we consider these to be incremental adjustments to a story that remains basically unchanged  housing is currently exerting a considerable drag on aggregate economic activity  that drag should lessen in the second half of this year and the pace of expansion should pick up somewhat  however the reacceleration of activity seems likely to be limited  the slowdown in house prices implies a diminishing impetus from household wealth and the normal multiplieraccelerator consequences of the current hit to home construction should restrain the growth of consumption and business investment
with growth projected to remain below potential the unemployment rate is expected to drift up to 51 percent by the end of next year a bit above our previous projection
as for inflation we have had only minor changes in our forecast of its key determinants  as i noted earlier the path of oil prices is up about 5 per barrel and this adds about  percentage point to overall pce inflation this year boosting our forecast to 2 percent for 2007 and leaving 2008 unchanged at about 2 percent  the indirect effects of higher oil prices add a few basis points to our forecast of core pce inflation but those effects were roughly offset by the slightly larger gdp gap and the slightly higher unemployment rate in this forecast  after the forecast closed last week we received the cpi and the ppi for february  the core cpi increased 02 percent last month right in line with our projection  however a jump in the ppi series on physician services suggests that core pce prices could be up about 03 percent in february a tenth above our forecast  if this estimate is close to the mark we will revise up our forecast of core pce inflation in the first quarter to about 2 percent  we are not inclined however to accord much signal to one monthly
reading and for now we are sticking with our forecast for core pce inflation of 2 percent this year and 2 percent in 2008  one reason for keeping the inflation forecast unchanged despite this news on prices is that we have had some low readings on labor compensation  the eci and average hourly earnings have come in below our forecast after we adjust for the transitory influence of a jump in bonuses and stock options the growth of nonfarm business hourly compensation looks to be running below our previous forecast  looking at the big picture pressures on inflation do not appear to us to be intensifying but they also dont seem to be abating much either
for the most part that is what we had been expecting to see at this juncture  i will now turn the floor over to karen to sum up developments in the other 190 economies of the world  laughter
ms johnson  constructing our outlook for the rest of the global economy this time entailed assessing the information in and implications of varying indicators of activity from different regions the somewhat weaker prospects for us output growth and the backup in global oil prices  in addition we struggled to understand the likely consequences of the episode of financial market volatility that emerged in global equity and credit markets at the end of february as well as the risks to our forecast that this episode might foreshadow  in the end our baseline forecast for real gdp growth abroad is just slightly stronger over this year and about the same next year as in the january greenbook  our projection for foreign inflation has been revised up just a little in response to the higher level of our path for oil prices  the resulting contribution for us real gdp growth this year from the external sector is about neutral and that for next year is a small negative we now see exports relative to the january forecast as contributing slightly more positively to us gdp growth over the forecast period and are projecting an arithmetic negative contribution from imports that is a bit smaller in magnitude especially this year
the favorable news for activity abroad was mostly from the major foreign industrial countries  we were particularly surprised by japanese real gdp growth in the fourth quarter which in the latest data was an annual rate of 55 percent
2 percentage points above our expectation in january  household consumption showed some signs of strengtha development that has been lacking in japanese economic activity for a long time  in addition private investment spending increased at a doubledigit rate  available indicators for activity in january such as machinery orders and household expenditures support the view that solid expansion is continuing and we have revised up our nearterm forecast such that our projected growth rate for 2007 is  percentage point stronger  the economic expansion in the euro area continues to firm and we were surprised by the fourthquarter growth rate there as well  the 36 percent annual rate of growth recorded for last quarter was
1 percentage point higher than we had expected in january  that strength was due particularly to investment and to export demand  we have revised up our outlook for growth over the forecast period about  percentage point as a result
within emerging asia real gdp continues to expand vigorously in china and in india sustaining expansion in the region at an average annual rate of about 6 percent
we see average growth in latin america this quarter as having been slowed by weakness in mexico that is related to softness in us manufacturing production mexican growth should rebound in line with the projected improvement in us industrial production resulting in average growth in the region of about 3 percent over the forecast period  we have revised down slightly our forecasts for growth in mexico and emerging asia relative to the january outlook
on balance we do not see the negative implications of the slightly weaker us projection this time as outweighing the indications of robust domestic demand in europe and asia  accordingly our baseline forecast continues to be for vigorous growth on average abroad  a weaker us outcome than projected is clearly a downside risk for the global economy however  the rise in oil prices over the intermeeting period erased some of the inflation restraint that the low january level of global crude prices provided  we have added a couple of tenths to our inflation projection as a result with most of the upward revision projected for the asian emergingmarket economies that are very dependent on imported crude oil
the heightened financial market volatility that appeared in late february was a global event with stock prices in several major foreign countries declining 2 to
6 percent through the date of the greenbook and then retracing somewhat over the past week  credit spreads widened for risky credit abroad including emerging market sovereign risk spreads and yields on longterm governments bonds moved down in the euro area the united kingdom and canada as investors shifted to higher quality securities  but in many instances these moves just brought the particular price or yield back to its level toward the end of last year  although the drop in chinese stock prices on february 27 was seen on that day as a contributing factor market developments on subsequent days support the view that much of the concern of global investors is directed toward the us expansion and in particular the us subprime mortgage market  we do not see the market correction to date as a source of significant restraint on spending abroad  in addition the evident weakness in the
us housing sector has limited potential for spillover to economic activity abroad accordingly we have strengthened a little our forecast for foreign real output growth and reduced the magnitude of the net subtraction from us gdp growth implied by the projections for exports and imports  clearly global financial market participants are ready to react strongly to any news suggesting lessfavorable outcomes on investments  this poses a negative risk to the global outlook as the financial market response to a negative shock may intensify the consequences of that shock for credit extension spending and ultimately global growth  on the upside we have been surprised by the strength of domestic demand in some foreign industrial countries and we could be underestimating its momentum  in addition a more buoyant outcome for china is always a possibility
last week we received data on the us balance of payments for the fourth quarter completing our picture for the year as whole  although the annual total for the current account deficit rose in 2006 the balance for the fourth quarter narrowed quite a bit  that narrowing is due to a reduced trade deficit and a swing to positive in
the figure for net investment income  a decrease in our nominal oil bill largely accounts for the improvement in the trade deficit but the nonoil trade balance also narrowed somewhat  the smaller bill for imported oil in the fourth quarter resulted mainly from lower prices although the quantity imported declined as well  the balance on the portfolio portion of us net investment income was a sizable deficit that widened about 4 billion at an annual rate from the previous quarter  however the positive balance on direct investment income jumped nearly 40 billion at an annual rate as receipts continued to be robust and payments fell sharply  the decline in payments was widespread across sectors and countries  the net result was a positive figure for total investment income of nearly 19 billion
going forward we expect that the current account deficit will resume widening from its reduced fourthquarter level and will reach about 950 billion or 6 percent of gdp by the end of 2008  we project that a widening of the trade deficit will continue with the oil and the nonoil components of the merchandise balance both becoming larger deficits  however a positive change in the balance on services will partially offset the deterioration in the deficit on traded goods  the net investment income balance should account for a larger portion of the current account widening the positive balance of direct investment income should drop back in the near term but then rise slowly to record a small positive net change over the forecast period
however the negative balance for portfolio income is expected to increase in magnitude significantly as our net international investment position records yet greater net indebtedness  this increasing net indebtedness and wider current account deficit will continue as long as the trade deficit remains sizable  david and i will be happy to answer any questions
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  are there questions
president poole
mr poole  dave i have a question related to housing  i gather that a good part of the
projection that the drag from housing will work off by the end of this year comes from the belief
that sales will gradually clean out the inventory of unsold homes and once that happens
construction can return to the rate of sales  thats the unsold inventory of recently built new
homes that i guess have never been occupied  if you take the housing boom over say the three
years ending in the middle of last year was there an accumulation of houses that ran beyond the
underlying demographics and incomeand the financing costs too  im interested in those
longerrun determinants of the equilibrium stock of housing  did we end up with a stock of
housing that outran the underlying longrun determinants and has to be worked offin the sense
that the underlying determinants have to catch up to the stock that has already been constructed
mr stockton  thats possible  we have not taken that view  overall housing
construction had some unexplained strength over the past year not from a bottomup
demographic addition but just in terms of what we would have expected given the growth in
employment income and wealth  admittedly the evidence is still very tentative but we think
we see some signs of demand stabilizing around current levels so that in our starts forecast
well be able to drive the months supply of homes back down relative to the low level that it had
actually been running from the mid1990s to the middle of the housing boom  so i dont think
were seeing an excess supply of homes that people just wont want at current prices or roughly
current prices but that is a considerable risk  adding up household formations and
demolitionstheres a lot of uncertainty about that and theres a lot of cyclical sensitivity as
well to the overall household formation rates  so whether the housing stock outran the longrun
determinants is kind of hard to nail down  we see that as a risk but its not incorporated in this
forecast  if that were the case there could be a bigger drag on housing activity than were
anticipating
mr poole  recovery in that sector could take much longer
mr stockton  yes
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  dave i have a question about the significant downshift in employment
that you have starting around midyear because i notice that output per hour continues to move
along quite nicely throughout the period through the end of next year  is that just a bet that most
of the expansion on the supply side will come from productivity or is something else going on
there
mr stockton  its a combination of two bets that are probably both risky  one is
that in fact productivity will continue and that what weve seen more recently is a little more
pronounced cyclical sag in productivity growth and not a sign that underlying structural
productivity is weaker than were estimating  the second bet is that on the supply side the
growth in the labor force will be relatively weak  therefore we will not need to have as much
employment growth
mr stern  the unemployment rate does go up
mr stockton  those are two elements of the forecast that were struggling with
over the past few months there has been a little evidence perhaps that the participation rate has
been a bit higher than our model was forecasting  that might suggest some upside risk on the
labor force growth  on the other hand the productivity figures have probably been running
below what our model would have expected given our estimate of structural productivity
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  just for clarification david from peak to trough in terms of housing
starts what percent change in construction do you forecast
mr stockton  were thinking of a decline something like 35 or 40 percent at this
point
mr fisher  so 21 million is that right
mr stockton  in our forecast were not too far from the bottom  we made the
bottom a little deeper this time and put it off just a little bit longer  i said before that we saw
signs that demand was stabilizing  in some sense the adjustment that weve made for these
recent subprime developments suggests to us that there will be another small stepdown in
demand going forward from where we currently are  that makes the process of working off the
inventory to which president poole pointed a little more prolonged  it also puts this housing
downturn in terms of magnitude very close to the one that occurred in the early 1990s
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  if not we are ready for the
economic goround  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  recent data on economic activity have been
downbeat in many sectors and i agree with the general tenor of the greenbook that the nearterm
outlook is weaker than before  indeed we have cut expected growth this year almost 
percentage point to 2 percent  this pace of growth is substantially below potential and we
expect the unemployment rate to start to edge up fairly quickly  even relative to this lower
baseline i think the downside risks to the prospects for output growth have sharpened in the
intermeeting period  im especially concerned about two risksbroader retrenchment in
financial markets along the lines that were seeing in the subprime mortgage market and a further
hesitation and faltering of capital spending
as we discussed in detail two years ago an asset price bubble inevitably leads to
unsustainable imbalances in the economy and a misallocation of resources  the extraordinary
runup in house prices in recent years led to construction and sales booms that couldnt last  so
far the adjustments to moresustainable levels of housing starts and sales have been relatively
orderly  however there is still an overhang of precarious financing from the past relaxed
mortgagelending standards that has to be eliminated  for example in 2005 and 2006 something
like 40 percent of firsttime homebuyers put no money down with their purchase  the market is
beginning to recognize the size of this overhang and with the recent deterioration in the
performance of subprime mortgages is dramatically reassessing mortgage risk  going forward
we will have to closely monitor increases in mortgagerisk compensation and tightening of credit
standards  such changes especially if they go too fast or too far could amplify the housing
sector decline as has been recognized pushing housing prices and activity down and with
spillovers to consumer spending they could prove to be a substantial drag on the overall
economy
despite the recent turmoil in equity and mortgage markets a reassessment of overall risk
has yet to occur  we are still in an environment of low longterm yields ample liquidity and
what appears to be a generally low level of compensation for risk  for example i recently talked
with the principals of several major privateequity funds who were not just amazed but also
appalled about the amount of money their industry has attracted  laughter  one partner said
that he would have no difficulty immediately raising 1 billion  indeed one of his biggest
problems is wouldbe investors who get angry at him because he is unwilling to take their
money  this unwillingness reflects his difficulty in identifying deals that are likely to yield
adequate returns even though for the buyout firms debt also is available in what they depict as
very attractive socalled covenantlite termsperhaps too attractive given the vulnerability of
some of the highly leveraged yields  my contacts suggest that some privateequity firms with
similar assessments of the shortage of profit opportunities are less restrained and do take
additional money partly because of the large upfront fees that are generated by these deals  so
just as we have seen in mortgage markets the bubble in private equity as my sources
characterize it and the overabundance of liquidity more generally raise the risk of a sharp
retrenchment in credit and higher risk spreads with associated risks to economic growth and
conceivably even financial stability
a second related risk concerns investment spending  its surprising that despite the
ample financing available firms have still been reluctant to ramp up their capital spending
certainly any precipitous tightening of financing could curtail investment  however as noted in
one of the greenbook alternative simulations greater business pessimism about future returns to
new capital is also a significant risk  the recent pullback in orders and shipments for capital
goods has persisted and deepened more than any of us had anticipated  even for hightech
spending which continues to expand my contacts on the manufacturing side are not very
optimistic  sales of pcs and related equipment were mildly disappointing in 2006 and our
contacts dont see the introduction of the microsoft vista operating system in january as having
generated much enthusiasm among businesses
turning to inflation our outlook for core inflation like that of the greenbook has
changed little since january  i continue to anticipate gradually moderating inflation with core
pce price inflation edging down from 2 percent in 2006 to 2 percent this year  there are
certainly clear upside risks to this forecast especially given the resumption of increases in
energy prices  these risks remain despite some weakening in the outlook for real activity  in
principle the anticipated subpar growth should help relieve inflationary pressures  however we
remain very uncertain about what par is  the continued low unemployment rate coupled with
recent sluggish output growth suggests via okuns law that potential output could be growing in
the vicinity of 2 percent  if contrary to our assumption that were the case any labor market
tightness now boosting inflation might not diminish this year
morefavorable news is found in recent survey evidence on inflation expectations  as
many of you have commented in past meetings inflation expectations are perhaps more
influential to the inflation outlook than is the unemployment rate  their relative stability over
the past several years has probably been a key factor restraining the rise in inflation over the past
two years  however what has not generally been noted is the importance of nearterm inflation
expectations those with a forecast horizon of a year or two  both economic theory and empirical
evidence suggest that these nearterm inflation expectations are as important as longrun
expectations for determining inflation dynamics  the latest blue chip and professional
forecasters surveys both show expectations of core inflation edging down next year  for
example the spf shows core pce inflation dropping to 2 percent next year exactly in line with
our own forecast  i also see the general downward tilt in inflation expectations over the next
couple of years as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the seventh district are
similar to what i reported last time  business activity continues to expand at a modest pace
however while my contacts expressed some increased uncertainty most of them maintained a
positive view about the outlook for the second half of the year  as we know the two sectors that
generated the most uncertainty this round are housing and business investment and so i want to
concentrate some of my comments on those two areas
on the housing front my contacts continue to be unsure about how soon the turnaround
will be  a director from pulte homes saw hints of a better tone in the market but acknowledged
that signs were still tentative  he did say that the larger builders have reduced their stock of
speculative homes  another director who is ceo of us gypsum thought it would be a couple
of months before he had a better idea whether the market had hit bottom  furthermore he
thought that even after the market hits bottom it would be quite a while before building
materials recovered to normal sales levels  as we were discussing the subprime situation could
be a serious problem for the macroeconomy in a couple of ways  one would be a major
spillover to house pricesits too soon to tell about this now but new spring listings should shed
some light by our next meeting  the other would be significant fallout to other credit market
segments and we dont see this yet either  i contacted both gm and ford and they said that the
subprime mortgages held by their credit subsidiaries had deteriorated but they had not seen
increased defaults in other portions of their portfolios  notably they had not seen any unusual
problems in auto loans and we generally heard this sentiment of a lack of spillover from bankers
as well  on the supply side given the ample liquidity in financial markets it seems unlikely that
the subprime problem will cause major changes in overall credit availability or pricing
turning to business investment none of my contacts reported any major changes in
capital spending plans one way or the other  that said i did sense that businesses had become a
bit more cautious as david mentioned  a ceo of a major bank thought that some of this
caution was due to the news in the subprime market but he didnt think that this was impinging
on spending in a meaningful way  as noted by the head of a major privateequity firm who is
on our board the recent volatility in financial markets has not significantly altered the
availability or terms for financing even for riskier projects  privateequity firms continue to
raise large sums as janet discussed  so although im more concerned about the outlook i dont
see the forces in play that would generate a major retrenchment in capital spending  inventories
are another factor that has weighed on growth recently  weve heard mixed reports from district
contacts about how far along they are in the inventoryadjustment process  in steel the process
seems to be taking longer than expected but in motor vehicles both gm and ford now are
generally comfortable with their inventory positions and currently are not planning any major
changes in their assembly schedules  finally some sectors of the economy appear to be on good
footing  healthy labor markets continue to support solid gains in consumer spending and as
karen discussed growth abroad continues to support export demand
after balancing all the factors we marked down our nearterm forecast for gdp a bit but
retained the basic contours of our previous projection  the most important difference between
our forecast and the greenbook is that we do not see as much shortterm weakness but the
uncertainty surrounding this forecast has increased  by itself the change to the growth outlook
this round would suggest slightly less inflation risk but other factors point to continued concern
about inflation  the past couple of readings on consumer prices have been disappointing  oil
prices are higher than at our last meeting and unit labor costs accelerated noticeably over the
past year  furthermore labor markets remain tight  so while the benefits of some factors
notably the earlier declines in energy costs will be transitory pressures from high labor costs are
likely to persist  markups remain high enough to absorb some cost increases but these margins
could evaporate quickly as they did in the late 90s
in the end we did not materially change our outlook for inflation  we continue to project
that core pce prices will increase about 2 percent both this year and next  this inflation rate is
too high for my taste and i think for many of us and im not confident that inflation will
moderate adequately as we move into 2009  one reason for my concern is highlighted in the
bluebooknamely that the private sector seems to be betting that our inflation objective is 2
percent or higher  so i continue to think that over the forecast period as a whole the risks to
price stability exceed the risks to sustainable growth
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  the economic picture in our region has
changed little since our last meeting  it seems as though ive used that phrase almost every
meeting for the past three meetings  economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace in our
district  business contacts expect that pace to continue in the coming months  according to our
march survey manufacturing activity in our region remained flat and weve seen little change in
this activity in the last six months  the general activity index actually fell from 06 in february
to 02 in march which are both essentially the same and very close to zero  but there were some
positives to be read from the survey  first both the new orders and shipment indexes improved
this month  second the diffusion index of capital expenditures which reflects firms planned
spending six months from now moved up to 25 percenta level that is considerably above the
average level of 18 seen over the past two expansions  third other indexes of future activity
remain relatively strong  finally in response to a special survey question and ignoring merely
seasonal changes in activity twice as many of our firms said that they expect their own
production to accelerate rather than to decelerate in the second quarter compared with the first
quarter46 percent compared with 23 percent  i take these as signs that our manufacturers see
the soft patch as temporary rather than more prolonged and this is consistent with the anecdotal
evidence gathered in talking to the business contacts in our region  thus business sentiment
among our manufacturing firms appears to have changed little since our last meeting
there has been little change not only in overall activity but also in the pattern across
sectors  housing continues to weaken  area homebuilders that we surveyed in february
indicate that sales continue to decline and high inventories continue to hold back construction
activity  nonresidential real estate markets in the region remain firm but construction has not
gained any appreciable strength  one of my contacts in a major bank sees continued strong loan
demand however  businesses that come to him for loans have strong balance sheets their
profits remain good and from his perspective that is supportive of continued business investment
going forward  this may be suggesting that business investment whichas many of us have
been concerned abouthas been weak in the past several months may be on the verge of
rebounding  labor markets in the region remain tight  employment in my three states has
grown at a pace of 13 percent over the past three months ending in january an acceleration from
the 08 percent pace over the past twelve months  the unemployment rate has held steady and
employers continue to complain of difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled labor
on the inflation front prices for industrial goods continue to move up but retail price
increases have not been widespread  however there are signs of increased pressures on wages
and salaries  wages in lowskilled jobs in new jersey and pennsylvania have certainly increased
because of increases in state minimum wages yet the acceleration in wages appears to be more
widespread  employers in a number of industries have said they had to raise salaries much more
this year than they did last year in order to hire and retain workers in certain professional and
managerial occupations as well as highskilled workers in a variety of jobs
in summary business activity in the region continues to advance at a moderate pace
im looking for other words to substitute for moderate which gets old after a while  our
business contacts expect this moderate pace to be maintained in coming months
turning to the national economy at the time of our last meeting the data on real activity
had come in stronger than expected and inflation while still elevated had moved down a bit
since then the data suggest perhaps a somewhat weaker nearterm growth outlook and a
backsliding in my view in the progress on inflation  if these recent data are indicative of the
future then we are in a much less comfortable position than we thought we were a few weeks
ago  i think there is still good reason to believe that the weakness we are seeing on the real side
of the economy remains confined to the effects of the housing correction and to a lesser extent of
the auto correction which should moderate over the year and that the fundamentals underlying
the economy remain somewhat strong  i think that labor markets will be considerably firmer
than in the greenbook forecast and that the consumer sector will also hold up in part because of
that
its particularly difficult to infer trends from the data from this past january and
february  a sizable swing in temperatures from one of the warmest januarys on record to one of
the coldest februarys has led to large swings in both seasonal factors and the economic data
more broadly  so i think that we need to be a little more cautious than usual in trying to interpret
these volatile monthtomonth numbers  that said i must admit that the uncertainty surrounding
my own forecast that growth will soon return to trend has increased since our last meeting  the
recent decline in new orders over the past several months suggests that the weakness weve seen
in business investment in the fourth quarter may linger a little longer than expected despite
healthy business balance sheets and positive investment and business sentiment  although in my
view the reassessment of risk in the subprime mortgage market suggests that this market is
working as it should the overall weakening in credit conditions in the mortgage market increases
uncertainty as to whether the housing correction will be contained or whether it will spill over
into other sectors of the economy  thus although im not really ready to abandon my forecast i
do think my uncertainty of that forecast has increased somewhat
at the same time im less convinced that inflation is moderating and that were making
sufficient progress toward price stability  perhaps i really should say that i am more concerned
that we are not  the twelvemonth change in the core cpi was 27 percent and the threemonth
change has reaccelerated  i find the upward trend in core inflation over the past year from 2 to
2 percent troubling  i take some comfort in the fact that inflation expectations have moved
down somewhat  even tenyear expected inflation in our firstquarter survey of professional
forecasters moved down to 235 percent from 25 percent  thats a seismic event laughter
given the stability of that number over the past eight years  however these expectations
continue to lag not lead inflation  so i remain concerned with the inflation numbers that we are
in fact seeing  thus i find myself back to where i was this fall  a slowdown in real economic
activity if sustained would suggest a lower equilibrium real rate but inflation remains elevated
at this point i would allow for some implicit policy firming implied by a constant fed funds rate
unless we see stronger evidence of a declining economy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman ill spend a little time on the district  i think you can
describe it as almost robust recognizing that we are a district that exports a lot of raw materials
and byproducts of raw materials  we have had solid job gains led by further tightening in our
labor markets and recent revisions suggest that 2006 job growth was stronger than we had
previously thought  mining led the job growth but we also saw strong gains in professional and
business services and in leisure and hospitality  in fact our ski season this year was a record as
the snow was also a record  besides shortages of skilled labor of which we are constantly
getting reports we are seeing also shortages of some lowerskilled workers as wellin the
temporary employment area for example
it is also noteworthy that our manufacturing activity has been strengthening  we have
received good reports from our directors and advisory council members that it actually
strengthened in february  lower inventories of finished goods led to a surge in order backlogs
and most industries reported robust activity led by machinery and hightech equipment
production  in addition plant managers expressed greater optimism about the outlook for
employment and capital spending as they look forward not as theyre looking right now
turning to real estate housing activity may have stabilized  we have suffered like the
rest of the country in that area especially in our denver market where we have had record levels
of foreclosure  but beyond thatand even therewe have seen some stabilizing in our housing
market and our commercial activity remains really quite solid  housing permits and the value of
new residential construction held steady in february  in addition the buildup of home
inventories has actually slowed and district contacts expect inventories to decline gradually in
the coming months as they are now seeing things turn  nonresidential construction remains
strong with absorption of office space increasing in most cities and vacancy rates continuing to
decline throughout our region  commercial real estate contacts expect more new construction in
the months ahead  they are actually seeing it come on the drawing board  they also reported
that office prices and rents increased further even though sales were somewhat flat over the last
month or so
farm financial conditions have improved overall with increased crop prices that are
being driven by the expanded ethanol production  usda forecasts that net farm income will rise
about 10 percent this year  strong income prospects have boosted land pricessignificantly i
might add in some partsand solidified farm balance sheets  one piece of information i would
note is that ethanol is a boom industry right now in the regionnot in just our region but in the
area around nebraska and iowa  in that area 100 plants are producing there are 50 on the
drawing boards but we are seeing some backing away from that  three projects have been
pulled back in oklahoma recently and one more in kansas  but still a lot are going forward
and it gives me some pause because it has the tone of too much too quickly and the real
economy will suffer if it backs away from that development  anyway on balance the regional
economy is very strong right now
turning to the national outlook i would say that on balance although i have revised my
outlook down somewhat in 2007 i still have it projected as growing on the whole for the year
better than 2 percent  so my outlook is more optimistic than that of the greenbook  there are
some reasons for that at least that were thinking through  like others we see housing
stabilizing perhaps taking a little longer to come back but inventories seem to have stabilized
as those inventories are worked off through the first half of this year we think housing should
improve through the rest of the year at least given where the fixed interest rates lie  were also
seeing that the secondary effects of the slowing of the housing market seem contained at the
moment so that slowing is not spilling over and the containment is being strengthened by the
facts that personal incomes are actually continuing to improve and that we have a good labor
market  so those factors are important  also as we discussed earlier foreign demand is strong
and the outlook seems to be good  finally federal spendingthe fact is that were fighting a
war and you tend to spend more over the course of a waris picking up i think  coffers are
strong and states are spending at a fairly rapid rate  so a lot of factors are affecting demand and
therefore i think that this economy will pick up as the year goes on
i recognize very clearly that there are some risks to keep in mind  one is that the housing
market could worsen and there could be further spillovers  im very mindful of that  but on the
other side i do share some of the concerns raised by others in terms of the inflation outlook
inflation has not come down as much as we had hoped although im still projecting that it will
so long as we keep the rates at their current levels  but there are some upside risks with the
tighter labor market and strong demand and we could see energy prices putting more pressure on
it  so its a mixed bag perhaps with on balance some upside risk as well as downside risk to
this economy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i was reminded the other day that the original story of
goldilocks was not quite as we later came to learn it  the first version that was drafted was
actually called silver hair  when the three bears came back to the house the elderly lady not
the little girl jumped out the window  that was the beginning of the goldilocks story which
was later adapted to a more palatable commercial story  laughter  im not ready to jump out
the window yet but i do have some concerns and id like to talk about three areasthe
international side where the porridge seems to be hot the domestic economy where it seems to
be cooling and in my district where it seems to be just about right
so first on the international side just to complement some of karens points our
research and anecdotal findings show that global capacity utilization has moved to the higher end
of its range  world unemployment rates have been falling  capacity expansion seems to be
underpaced even though there is some structural change in utilization and it seems insufficient
to meet demand or quell inflation  prices for imported us goods have clearly moved away
from deflationary trends to neutral or slightly inflationary as i reported beforeand by the way
across nearly all product categories  the growing tightness in the market for skilled foreign
labor may be the contributing factor  a very large foreign retailer operating in china reports that
they are seeing wage price inflation for the first time in the stores that they are opening and
operating  as one of the hightech ceos mentioned to me earlier even the indians that they
now import not by bringing them physically across but by fiber optic cable are being priced
much more expensively  if you add turnover these workers have become increasingly
expensive  we see pressure from the shippers noting that there are continued upward pressures
on fleet utilization spot prices and port congestion  airlines are reporting stronger international
loads and price traction than in the united states  express shippers and logistic companies are
reporting doubledigit growth in the year to date in europe and still higher rates of growth in
asia  so on balance our view from the dallas fed from the international perspective is that
international data and anecdotal evidence point to some excess demand outside the united states
with concomitant increases in price pressures
turning to the domestic scene we appear to be sailing between the charybdis of a
slowdown in the economy and the scylla of higher inflation  i want to talk about both  were
both measuring and hearing of greater fragility in the domestic economy relating to economic
growth and the kind of excess that is leading to the financial turbulence that janet spoke about
ill turn to that in a second  also were not encouraged despite our wishful thinking on the
inflationary front  let me just give you some points other than those that have already been
mentioned particularly other than capital spending which we see slowing across the nation
express shippers logistic companies report 02 percent growth year over year for domestic
ground operations and weakerthanexpected overall growth between 0 and 05 percent on
balance in the year to datesubstantially less than they expected  rail car loadings are flat to
down reflecting the decline in demand for materials for housing and a decline in durable goods
orders  truck tonnage is off and orders for replacement of fleets seem to be reflecting more
than the effect of these new engine regulations that are going into place  ill give you one data
point mentioned  peterbilts order book is onethird of what it was last year  airlines report
weaker domestic booking and slackening demand relative to last year  with regard to the
retailers i have been urged to be cautious in analyzing the data first because last year was in
essence a fiftythreeweek year because of the late holiday or a thirteenmonth year due to gift
cards  our contacts report continued strength for highend retailers 3 to 6 percent unit growth in
the first quarter for middle retailers like kohls and jcpenney and significantly lower growth
rates with companies like walmart praying that the advancement of daylight savings time will
lift them from flat growth to 1 to 2 percent comps  finally restaurants report continued
movement down the food chainno pun intendedlaughter from the middleincome eateries
to the mcdonalds of the world  if you notice mcdonalds reports they are quite stout whereas
the middleincome eateries are suffering  in short we expect slower topline growth across the
board
i want to talk for a minute about housing  one of my contacts at walmart mentioned
that when they recently surveyed their customers concerns about housing did not even rank in
the top ten of consumers concerns  despite that a large housebuilder whom i mentioned in
previous conversations around this table says that they have gone from monsoons to scattered
thunderstorms and another reports a decline in the need to grant concessions  yet both are
concerned about subprime and alta infection as one called it  going back to our previous
conversation one of the builders whose average home price exceeds 300000 has through
thorough analysis just discovered that 40 percent of last years builds were financed by alta
mortgages  if you look at the security analysis for that particular company the best guesstimate
is 20 percent  so being from the clinton administration im a bit worried im getting to the
point where dont ask dont tell may be the best approach to interviewing some of these
homebuilders  clearly they are concerned  they have an overstock of inventory and theyre
beginning to cut back significantly on activity  if you remember david originally i did talk
about a 25 percent peaktotrough correction when you were not quite at that number  now ive
caught up with you  im at 40 percent at a minimum and quite concerned about it
im also concerned about what president yellen referred to as a possibility for a
retrenchment in the credit markets  i point as others have done to the significant oversupply of
privateequity capital  to give you a specific example in the case of texas utilities between a
friday and a wednesday the two principal investors lined up 25 billion apiece another billion
from five other equity investors and in the end over 50 billion of committed capital from the
banks in a twoday lineup period only half of which was used  so mr chairman in short in
the domestic economy im concerned that the tail in terms of a recession has not become
slimmer as i mentioned last time  i would redact those words  i believe it has become fatter and
i believe that financial market turbulence has a potential to become greater
as to the scylla of inflation i keep telling myself david that with the passage of time
well see improvement that one months set of numbers such as we had in december does not a
trend make  i tell myself that two months numbers like those we saw in december and
january do not a trend make  but the numbers are less than comforting  on a sixmonth basis
through january both our trimmed mean at the dallas federal reserve bank and your pce
excluding food and energy are stuck at 21 percent  on a twelvemonth basis the trimmed mean
was stuck at 25 percent and your pce excluding food and energy was 23 percent  the recent
cpi report was hardly encouraging  sixtyeight percent of the components rose 3 percent or
more  to be sure there are tamer oer readings but theyre being offset by a pickup in core
goods inflation  i continue to worry about the political effect of this kind of inflationary run  i
note yesterdays headline in the christian science monitor stating that inflation is eating up
us wage gains
on the regional side what ive reported above is reflected to some extent in the eleventh
district  growth has slowed but housing prices are stable and housing inventories are thus far
healthy  yet we continue to experience significant wage price pressures  our dynamics are
much stronger than those of the rest of the nation  one of the credit card companies reports that
sales using their cards in our region were up 105 percent year over year through february
versus 1 to 4 percent on the eastern and western seaboards
in short mr chairman i see geographic dispersion in the growth patternsstrong
growth overseas relatively strong growth in our district and a developing worrisome growth
scenario for the rest of the united states  we see less abatement of inflation than we had hoped
for  with regard to preparing for tomorrows discussion about what to do about it i find myself
on the horns of a dilemma  i would say that the risks are more evenly balanced and yet the tail
of less growth and the risk of recession and the other tail of awfully stubborn inflation have
fattened and not trimmed  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  overall economic activity in the fifth
district expanded modestly in recent weeks though performance across sectors remains uneven
growth is centered in the services sector where moderately positive readings continue  real
activity has recovered somewhat in recent weeks and bigticket sales have posted modest gains
after two months of quite weak readings  in manufacturing our survey respondents continue to
report a downward drift in activity  they remain optimistic about their future prospects
however though many comment on generally weak current demand  labor markets remain tight
in most jurisdictions with the standard reports of spot shortages of skilled workers but wage
pressures are reported to be moderate  we continue to hear of some reasonably firm housing
activity in a number of district localities  home prices remain generally flat though builders are
offering more incentives to buyers  inflation pressures appear to have moderated in march
according to our latest survey but manufacturers and service providers expect price pressures to
increase modestly over the next six months
on the national level risks seem to have risen lately but my sense is that prospects are
still reasonably sound  subprime mortgages obviously have dominated the financial news in
recent weeks  concerns about the welfare of families suffering foreclosure are quite natural and
anecdotes about outright fraud suggest some criminality  but my overall sense of whats going
on is that an industry of originators and investors simply misjudged subprime mortgage default
frequencies  realization of that risk seems to be playing out in a fairly orderly way so far
mortgagebacked securities have lost value as risk spreads have widened and there have been
insolvencies among firms that specialized in this sector  the updating of risk estimates in light
of recent experience will lead to higher borrowing costs in the affected market segments and at
the margin this increase could shift some households from homeownership to renting  but in my
judgment that isnt likely to affect the net demand for housing units  notably we have not seen
broader risks to credit availability in other markets or to the financial safety net  perhaps the
greatest economic risk posed by recent subprime developments is legislation that impedes the
availability of credit or that provides financial support expost that was unanticipated exante but
affects private decisionmaking henceforth somewhat like ad hoc disaster relief
housing construction continues to contract of course and inventories remain elevated
the choppy winter data make it hard to gauge the descent but overall home sales seem to be
holding steady and we havent heard anything locally that suggests a renewed contraction in
demand  so the housing outlook hasnt changed much for me  however the recent weakness in
business investment has been disappointing  one would expect soft patches related to housing
autos and the new truck regulations but the broader sluggishness is a bit at odds with the
generally favorable fundamentals  i still expect this investment to pick up ultimately although i
have to admit that the recent data have left me a bit less certain especially about when  the
outlook for consumer spending remains fairly healthy though  real disposable income growth
has been powered by continuing gains in employment and firmer wage growth  so all in all i
still think the current episode of belowtrend growth is fundamentally a transitory phenomenon
that will most likely be behind us by the end of the year although the recent weakness in
business investment suggests more downside risk than before
core inflation continues to firm and it now seems clear that the fourth quarters energy
induced lull is over  we have yet to see much sign of the longawaited easing in resource
utilization  its not obvious that we will be getting any help from labor costs any time soon and
inflation expectations remain centered at or above 2 percent  so to me the prospects for
moderation in inflation remain tenuous  i continue to believe that by summer growth concerns
are likely to be behind us and we will want to act to reduce inflation which we recognize is
higher than we want  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  comments from my business contacts
confirm the softening in economic activity that is depicted in the greenbook  most of the people
i talked with during this intermeeting period confirmed the slowing that we are seeing in the
national data  but at the same time they expect that business will improve over this year  my
business contacts are still planning to add modestly to staff and to expand output although their
capital spending plans are not particularly ambitious this year  a number of my business
contacts told me that the dollar depreciation is finally having an effect  they are getting more
orders and are being asked to quote more jobs from foreign customers
i have recently had conversations with ceos of the large banks from my district who
have an interesting perspective on the ongoing turmoil in the subprime mortgage market  they
dont seem to be particularly concerned that the situation in the mortgage markets is going to be
substantially worse than is already factored into the admittedly weak housing forecast  but they
are concerned as president yellen mentioned in her comments earlier that the subprime
mortgage problems are symptomatic of broader issues that could spill over into hedge funds and
privateequity fundsboth of which have become an increasingly important source of funding
for business investment activity  they worry that retrenching among managers of these funds
could adversely affect business confidence more generally  their comments resemble the
alternative greenbook scenario labeled business pessimism with spillovers  the difference
however is that my business contacts are suggesting that the problems could originate in the
financial sector and spill over to producers expectations
turning to inflation the volatility in the monthly retail price numbers even in the so
called core measures will make it difficult to clearly perceive the very modest progress in the
inflation trend that appears in the greenbook baseline  given the usual noise in the price data
work by my research department indicates that identifying a break in the inflation trend on the
order of about  percentage point with a fair amount of certainty can take somewhere between a
year and a half and two years after the break has in fact occurred  while i believe we are still on
a course that leads to a lower inflation trend the path we take to get there will not likely be a
smooth one and there will be times that will test our nerve  indeed as i look at the data today i
would judge that the downside risk to the real economy has increased somewhat  still in my
view the primary risk we face is that inflation could remain stuck higher than either i or the
greenbook foresee  under these conditions i think two qualities are essentialpatience and
clarity  we need to be patient so that we dont become unnecessarily aggressive in trying to
foster lower inflation in a softening economic environment and we need clarity so that the public
does not come to see our patience as indifference to the current inflation trend  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much mr chairman  perhaps unlike in the rest of the
country most of the recent cyclical data point to some reasons for optimism about nearterm
growth in new england with the possible exception of the rate of foreclosure initiations related
to subprime mortgages  the annual benchmark revisions by the bls paint a happier picture of
the current state of regional job growth especially in massachusetts and connecticut  the
overall message is that the region has been growing at a pace that is about at its longterm trend
and has been adding jobs consistently in recent months  this picture is a bit different from the
one weve been seeing for some time
the regions unemployment rate remains about at the nations and demand for skilled
labor as measured by both online and newspaper helpwanted ads and by anecdotal reports is
quite strong  indeed many continue to note that hiring the skilled workers they need has been
difficult  both temporaryhelp service firms and software and it firms report strong demand for
labor particularly to meet finance and technical positions and to meet a growing backlog in
activity in hightech businesses  this aspect of the regions labor market may be pulling some
discouraged workers back into the labor force as reflected in the perhaps temporary uptick in
unemployment  reflecting this better news on regional job growth the philadelphia feds
coincident economic indexes point to economic activity in the regions two largest states that is
on a par with national growth  when we surveyed a wide swath of retail contacts we saw a bit
of gloom on the retail side  but the fact that in new england you have an array of very small
companies sometimes in unique circumstances may have given a little downbeat sense to the
retail climate  the reports from larger retailers in the surveyand we have a couple of them
show solid yearoveryear growth  manufacturing employment continued to decline but
manufactured exports last quarter rose at a pace just a bit slower than the nations and were
buoyed by airlinerelated products fabricated metals and general machinery  as ive noted
before downtown vacancy rates in most of the cities in new england are declining as are
suburban office vacancies rents are rising and one or two corridors fanning out from boston are
reportedly hot sites for new biotech firm locations  business confidence as measured by local
surveys is up as is consumer confidence  so overall things are not too bad
a concern among this mostly brighter news is the rising rate of initiations of real estate
foreclosures especially those related to properties financed with subprime adjustablerate
mortgages  according to data from the mortgage bankers association whether one looks at the
rate of total foreclosures or at the pace of foreclosures among just subprime mortgages
initiations have risen rapidly in new england from a very low base and now outstrip the
nations  this is not a contest you want to win  anecdotes abound about individual borrowers
lured into what appear to be quite inappropriate mortgages and the federal reserve bank of
boston has been working with local bankers associations and the massachusetts banking
department and others on outreach and education  why new england generally and
massachusetts specifically should be outstripping the nation in this area isnt really clear  the
local banking industry does not appear to have played much of a role in subprime lending nor
were we an area of bubblelike real estate growth though clearly prices rose rapidly in the region
over a fairly long time  the detrimental effects to local communities from the rise in
foreclosures and the potential for negative political falloutnot unlike what president lacker
mentionedseem obvious
on the national scene the incoming data on the real economy with the possible
exception of job growth have been slower than i expected  inflation data if anything have been
higher  the picture is not comforting and it is complicated by questions related both to the
housing market and the surprisingly slow pace of business spending  many people around the
table have mentioned both those things  the degree of national fallout from problems in
subprime mortgage lending is a question right now as it bears both on the pace of recovery in
residential real estate investment and on the potential for wider spillovers from housing to
consumption  at present we in boston like the greenbook authors dont expect that subprime
mortgage problems will by themselves have much of an effect on overall growth  but we do
have a concern if these problems lead to tighter lending standards making mortgages and other
borrowing more difficult to obtain and thereby exacerbate housing inventory overhangs extend
the current period of sluggish new home starts and create further downward pressure on home
prices  so far we dont see much of that happening  trends in overall market and banking
liquidity mortgage interest rates and new mortgage issuance are all positive  we think that
those trends combined with positive consumer homebuying attitudes paint a reassuring picture
that some of the downward trends will not be as severe as they otherwise might be  indeed i
spoke to members of the advisory board of harvards joint center for housing studies in late
february  the group was composed of about fifty major homebuilders and major suppliers to
the building industry  they were in a bit of collective shock regarding the rapid deterioration
that they saw in their industry from late last year into the current quarter and seemed to be
focused on inventory and cost control rather than on profits this year which they didnt expect
however they saw continuing spending on home improvement growth from commercial
construction and strength in nonus markets as partial offsets  no one in the group mentioned
the subprime issue or potential problems in mortgage financing but that may have just been the
fact of the moment  it was actually the day before the market break in late february so its
possible that they are not thinking along the same lines today
we have also been asking ourselves why business fixed investment has been so slow
relative to fundamentals  we had been assuming that this inexplicable trend would right itself
and that growth of producers durable equipment would show greater signs of health but that
hasnt happened  we like the greenbook have written down expectations regarding pde  id
really like to be wrong on the downside regarding this area as it worries me a bit more than
subprime mortgages or any of the recent financial market ups and downs  if businesses lack the
confidence to invest in new equipment as much as they might be expected to given the
fundamentals how much longer will they continue to hire staff  if job growth slows what will
happen to consumption  to date both hiring and consumption remain pretty solid  but while i
saw some upside risks here at our last meeting now im a little worried on the downside  in
view of the incoming data we have written down our forecast much as the greenbook has and
we have joined the greenbook in a lower estimate of potential  we see growth a bit above
2 percent this year rising to the mid 2s in 08 with slightly rising unemployment and only
slightly slowing core pce inflation
however as i probably implied before i think the risks around this forecast on both sides
seem to have risen  will housing trends and the possible effects of diminished business spending
affect the resilient consumer more than we now expect  will the underlying pattern of core
inflation continue to surprise on the upside with the moderation we expect remaining mostly in
the forecast  i dont mean to overreact here  there are positives  external growth is strong
fiscal spending at both the state and the national levels should be supportive  financial markets
though certainly a bit more volatile and nervous remain accommodative  perhaps the downside
risks to growth that i see are simply the ebb and flow of the us economy continuing its
transition from an abovetrend rate of expansion just a year ago not unlike the slow patch we
saw in the late summer and early fall of last year  all in all i remain somewhat more concerned
about risks on the inflation side than about risks to growth  but it does seem to me as though the
balancing act in meeting our two objectives has gotten a bit more difficult
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan could you just say a word
about your outreach on the mortgage problems
ms minehan  we have done quite a bit of work with the banking department of the
state of massachusetts and with the massachusetts bankers association  we have had meetings
with those two groups in many of the affected areas around massachusetts basically looking to
provide education  weve done some materials on the education side  obviously once youre in
the midst of a foreclosure education isnt all that helpful  the banking department has been
trying to bring along local lenders to see what they can do to create a refinancing situation for
borrowers  were not part of that particular conversation but we have been part of the outreach
that the banking department has been making
chairman bernanke  well we here in washington expect to have to answer a
few questions about the subprime situation and we would be very interested in anyones
experience  if any other reserve bank is involved or has any plans wed be interested to hear
about them
ms minehan  i think we recently forwarded some information to governor kroszner
about this
mr kroszner  i havent received it  if you sent it by mail it could take a while
ms minehan  no no noi know that  laughter   i think we did it by email and
someone in your community affairs area may be in the process of passing it along
mr kroszner  okay great
ms minehan  but i have a copy of the email in my blackberry
chairman bernanke  they have to check the email for anthrax here laughter
ms minehan  i wondered about that  don didnt get one yesterday
chairman bernanke  on that note why dont we take fifteen minutes for coffee
and come back around 440 or a little after  the coffee is in the anteroom
coffee break
chairman bernanke  if we could reconvenei see a twohander from governor
kroszner
mr kroszner  i just wanted to mention with respect to foreclosures and wanted to
doublecheck my factsa note had been sent out from the boards consumer and community
affairs division to your consumer and community affairs groups concerning your activities in
mortgage foreclosures and jeff lacker fortunately has invited me to a conference two days from
now at which i will be speaking  unfortunately i will be unable to be at the hearing at which
sandy braunstein will be appearing  regardless of what you might think of me in this regard
please be sure to get things in to help sandy out  i think a lot of good activities are being done in all
the regional federal reserve banks and if we could just get a little information to her so that she
has a few examples to give that would be very helpful  then we will follow up in the longer run
because we hope to do a larger program here on some of these issues  thank you mr chairman
mr lacker  im sorry  what are you looking for examples ofmortgages we
foreclosed on  laughter
mr kroszner  just the oppositesandy could use examples showing that weve done
some outreach to help deal with some of the challenges of foreclosure  are there educational efforts
or studies that have been done
mr mishkin  we want to be the good guys
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  thank you for the earlier welcome  over
the intermeeting period aggregate economic activity in the sixth district showed signs of slowing
manufacturing activity appeared to soften with the majority of reports suggesting declining orders
retail reports pointed to a slowing pace of sales  the bls employment data revisions for 2006
supported the view that floridas economy has decelerated considerably in the wake of the housing
downturn  sales tax data suggest that retail spending in florida actually declined in late 2006
recovery on the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana continues to proceed more slowly than
hoped  the immediate posthurricane boost to spending has waned and the problems of housing
and insurance availability remain largely unresolved
the biggest concern for the sixth district continues to be in real estate markets  as stated at
the last meeting it appears to be too early to suggest that the regions housing situation has
stabilized or that the housing sectors drag on the district has ended  reports indicate that many
areas in florida are experiencing dramatic declines in sales of singlefamily homes and condos
even while new product continues to come onto the market  as a result of this oversupply
construction plans have been cut back  in january permit issuance for singlefamily homes in
florida was 57 percent lower than a year earlier  for the rest of the united states the decline was 25
percent  permits for multifamily development declined 40 percent versus a 7 percent decline
nationally  this situation is most extreme in florida  interestingly we do hear anecdotal reports of
improved potential buyer traffic in florida but that improvement is not translating into sales
buyers appear to be expecting lower prices  in the other states in the district singlefamily permits
were down 19 percent in january less than the decline nationally
regarding the regions exposure to nonprime and subprime mortgages the concern is again
mostly in florida  according to the mortgage bankers association over 9 percent of mortgages
serviced in florida in the fourth quarter of 2006 were subprime arm loans this exposure was
second only to nevada which was at 13 percent and compares with 6 percent nationally  in
contrast the exposures of the other states in the district were all at or below the national level
reports from banking contacts suggest that delinquency rates on nonprime arm loans in florida
will continue to trend higher this year  reduced access to credit for nonprime borrowers will slow
the absorption of the current oversupply of housing product and will put downward pressure on
house prices  also the boom in condo conversions and condo construction in 2005 and 2006
drained the supply of apartments in many areas in the district and landlords have been able to
increase rental prices as a result
turning to our perspective on the country as a whole much of the slowdown in real activity
that occurred in the second half of 2006 reflected weakness in the housing sector  if weakness
remains contained within the housing sector the outlook although subdued is acceptable in our
view  much of the recent moderation in real activity is consistent with what we had forecast several
months ago  realization of this moderation does not in itself imply that we should revise our
outlook  some professional forecasters continue to anticipate that real gdp growth will rebound to
close to its trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007 in effect discounting any drag from prolonged
weakness in residential investment  the atlanta fed staff forecasts for real gdp growth are
consistent with these optimistic commercial forecasts  the current greenbook forecast implies a
slightly weaker outlook from extended weakness in residential investment and weaker growth of
consumer expenditures perhaps incorporating some signal from the recent financial distress in
subprimes  despite slight differences in these forecasts the outlooks do not suggest recession at this
point  measured core inflation remains in excess of 2 percent  our staff consensus forecast sees
core inflation continuing in the range of 2 to 2 percent for all of 2007  this forecast is a bit less
favorable than the greenbook forecast but we have no sense that the inflation outlook has
deteriorated significantly
the implications of the outlook for real output and inflation are that current policy is set
about where it should be  the us economy has performed about as expected  financial market
turbulence and subprime mortgage distress raise potential concerns that should be monitored but
for now it seems that the outlook has not substantially changed  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  as others have commented the latest numbers
on the performance of the national economy have been mixed which is to say less positive than i
had expected and i take the greenbooks point that growth is subdued this quarter  i dont view the
recent news on inflation as especially favorable but i dont find it overly alarming either  the
question for me is do the latest readings have implications for economic performance beyond the
current quarterthat is say over the next several quarters or so  at this stage my answer to that
question is no in part because i want to avoid getting whipsawed by marking down the forecast
now only to mark it back up in may or june  more fundamentally i think that continued gains in
employment and income sound fundamentals for business investment sustained increases in
government spending and generally liquid financial conditions are likely to maintain the expansion
i also think that the trade situation may turn out to be a bit better than that depicted in the
greenbook assuming that energy prices dont take off a lot from here  i also take some comfort
that at least until now i havent viewed my forecast as especially ebullient  by the way i do think
that the housing correction still has some way to run as ive commented before largely because of
the overhang of unsold properties
to get some additional evidence on the latest developments we called a number of our
contacts in retailing late last week to see if we could detect anything new in consumer spending
the short answer i would say is no  a clear trend was not apparent from our contacts  some
reported significant increases in sales recently and were optimistic about prospects  some
experienced sales decreases and were at the least cautious and some said sales were unfolding more
or less as anticipated  overall this is probably modestly good news since at least there was no
obvious break in consumer outlays  as for inflation i would judge that the situation has not
changed appreciably and so i continue to expect modest deceleration over time  i dont sense that
price pressures are building at this point but you have to look pretty hard to find convincing signs of
moderation as well  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  regarding the small handful of contacts with
whom ive talked my trucking industry contact finds things slightly better in february and march
but things had been very very slow before that  the company has reduced its truck fleet by 300
my contact says that pricing is flat for the first time in six years there is a tremendous amount of
price competition  he says that hes getting four times the usual number of bids  so the customers
are shopping around hard looking for price concessions  he said things were just marginally better
both the ups and fedex contacts had a similar messagethat activity is coming in substantially
below what they had anticipated  the overnight letter business is decliningit is down about
4 percent the nextday package business is up about 4 percent  those are the express products
the net of those is about zero or maybe 1 percent and they had been expecting something on the
order of 3 percent  so theyre revising down their expectations for this year but apparently not
changing their underlying capital investment plans  however my ups contact in particular said
that they are really scrambling now to reduce outlays  essentially their commitments for expenses
are pretty well set in the short run and so revenue shortfalls go directly to the bottom line
therefore they are scratching around to reduce expenses  they are not replacing staff when theres
attrition and they are cutting out unnecessary travelall the usual kinds of things  they have
reduced staff focusing particularly on management positions which they have reduced by 1600
ive been reflecting on what we make out of the slowerthanexpected capital spending and
let me summarize my position this way  im just uneasy about the outlook  if the greenbook gdp
outlook is wrong im guessing were going to come in below it  im mindful of course of the
standard errors going in both directions and so forth and we could certainly have upside surprises
im just saying that im uneasy about that  im also uneasy about the inflation forecastit could be
on the high side or could hang higherand i worry particularly because its the one that produces
the most difficult policy situation for us with output coming in below expectations and inflation
hanging above target  thats the toughest  thats the classic policy dilemma situation  it causes
the most pain  so thats the one i concentrate on
it doesnt seem to me that were likely to have a traditional recession  money growth
remains on the high side  in the past six months m2 has been running about 7 percent and mzm
about 8 percentthat doesnt look like a recession  if you think about the expansion phase of the
cycle with the exception of housing there were no big imbalances  we didnt have the sort of dot
com and telecom overinvestment that we had in the late 1990s  so what might be going on here
well its clear that businesses have an intense desire to see increasing profits quarter after quarter
after quarter and when you get a revenue slowdown they go after costs even if it might not be
perhaps longrun profit maximizing but they feel an intense pressure  then you get a keynesian
kind of mechanism in which some people get laid off and some things get delayed and so forth and
that produces some declines in income and it could lead to a prolonged soft spot in the economy
thats the kind of process that i think may be under way  if thats whats happening were going to
have to be patient and let it work out  so thats where i am right now  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  our view of the outlook has
changed since our last meeting but more in the balance of risks and the sources of uncertainty than
in our actual forecast for growth  but just to go through the changes quickly weve reduced our
forecast for growth in 07 a bit to something less than 3 percent and we see more downside risks to
that forecast  weve moved up the expected path of core pce inflation just a bit in light of recent
numbers but we have maintained essentially the same view as beforethat inflation will moderate
to around 2 percent by the end of this year and a bit below that in 08  we see the risk to this
forecast still to the upside  we face greater uncertainty about the nearterm outlook than we have
over the past few meetings  looking to the medium term although we havent yet reduced our
estimate of potential growth were a bit more concerned than weve been about the strength of
underlying structural productivity growth going forward  we have also changed our view of the
appropriate path of policy a bit introducing a gentle move down now in the fed funds rate
beginning around the middle of the year  so this puts us a bit below the assumed path in the
greenbook but we assume a slower smaller reduction in the nominal fed funds rate than the market
does today  our forecast is quite close to that of the staffs in the greenbook and the basic story is
similar  our differences are the same as they have been for some timewe have slightly more
growth and slightly lower inflation  that reflects things we talked about before different views
about information dynamics and about potential growth  our view of the output gap and its
evolution however is similar
i have just a few points on some issues  on the growth front the recent numbers suggest
both a deeper adjustment in housing and a broader weakness in the economy than we anticipated
notably in capital goods orders  the effect of these developments on our forecast is not that large
however  their significance is more in the risk to the outlook and the uncertainty the puzzle that
the investment weakness presents for the medium term  on housing and consumption the
probability of the dark scenario is still small but it is higher than it has been and deserves some
attention  the dark scenario is the risk that the reduction in credit to the household sector amplifies
the decline in housing demand which leads to a greater adjustment in prices with a risk of a more
pronounced prolonged decline in growth and spending  monetary policy should not be directed at
trying to put a floor on housing demand or on prices only at limiting the risk that the weakness
accumulates substantially or spreads to overall demand  regarding capital spending we just dont
have a good explanation for whywith margins that are still pretty good reasonable earnings
growth solid growth in aggregate demand here and globally relatively low interest rates and
reasonable levels of business confidencespending has continued to come in well below our
expectations  this series of disappointments of course has been going on for some time its not
just about the latest numbers for durable goods orders  perhaps this situation will prove transitory
but it justifies a bit more caution to the outlook  of these two risksin housing and in
investmentid say the latter matters more and is potentially more consequential  but both of these
effects are offset in our basic view by the expected strength in personal income growth going
forward by what are still fairly favorable overall financial conditions and by fairly robust external
demand
regarding productivity productivity growth per quarter at an annualized rate has over the
past ten quarters come in significantly below 2 percent kind of close to the estimates of the trend
rate for the period between 73 and 95  some of the analysts who spend a lot of time thinking
about this are starting to lose conviction that trend growth is still in the neighborhood of 2 percent
for the nonfarm business sector  were still viewing the recent weakness as transitory or cyclical
but the risk that trend growth is below our estimate is i think increasing
on inflation despite the higher recent numbers not much has really changed in our view
we still expect core pce to move to below 2 percent over the forecast period and we still see the
risk as not getting quite that moderation  the sources of the recent negative surprises in the core
data which seem concentrated in medical services probably dont say much about monetary policy
or broader inflation dynamics and inflation expectations remain stable at reasonable levels  so our
view of the growth outlook has changed a bit but our view of the inflation outlook hasnt changed
much based on these numbers
on the markets as many people have said and as bill discussed at the beginning i dont see
much thats been troubling thus far  although correlations across asset markets have risen overall
liquidity seems fine  theres been very limited contagion from mortgages into other credit markets
debt issuance seems to be continuing  people are able to raise money to finance corporate
restructuring investment  there is very little concern i think about substantial losses on the basis
of whats happened to date in the core of the financial system and very limited evidence of stress
among the various funds  but its still early in some ways and the fundamental outlook for growth
is a bit weaker and more uncertain  risk premiums credit spreads and volatility still look
potentially vulnerable to a more substantial reversal  the weakness in the subprime market will
take some time to work through the full range of securities issued against pools of collateral that
include mortgages  the complexity in valuing structured mortgage products the difficulty in
designing hedges that actually work against exposure to that risk and uncertainty about the shape of
the adverse tail and that part of the credit spectrum are all conditions that apply to a range of other
structured credit markets and credit products  in the debate about the implications of this prolonged
yieldcurve inversion we have tended to side with those who have found comfort in the contrary
signal you see in lower levels of risk premiums and credit spreads  yet its possible that the forces
that may have been holding down forward rates are also holding down credit spreads and holding up
the value of other assets and therefore may be masking weakness in the economy rather than
masking strength
on balance although the outlook still looks fundamentally positive we see a more
complicated and less benign set of risks to the outlook more downside risks to growth and some
continued concern that we wont get enough moderation in inflation  to us this outlook justifies a
stance of policy with a path for the fed funds rate somewhat above what is now priced into the
markets  this doesnt mean in our view that we need to signal that nominal rates going forward
are more likely to rise than to fall from current levels it means only that we should convey the sense
that our view of the most likely evolution of policy still implies a higher path than is now priced into
the markets  we can afford to be patient before adjusting policy as sandy said but we need to have
as much flexibility as possible going forward  this suggests that we acknowledge that the overall
balance of risks has shifted a bit toward neutral toward a flat stance of policy but not all the way
there  a delicate task for us is to do this without inducing a reaction in the market that pulls forward
significantly more easing than has already occurred
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like many others i view the data over the
intermeeting period as not fundamentally undermining the basic contours of our expected forecast
were still on track for moderate growth and gradually ebbing inflation  the economy has enough
underlying strength bolstered by financial conditions that remain quite supportive of growth so that
the housing correction should not be enough to knock the economy off the moderate growth track
growth modestly below potential along with the unwinding of some special factors like rent
increases should allow further declines in inflation
realside data reflect the fact that the downshift from abovetrend growth for several years
to expansion at or a little below trend hasnt been entirely smooth and maybe we never should have
expected it to be so  besides the overpricing and overbuilding of housing businesses apparently
built their stocks of inventories and fixed capital in anticipation of continued strong growth and
were seeing downshifts in demand for inventories and capital to align them with the slower pace of
expected growth  businesses typically also hoard labor under these circumstances resulting in
weaker productivity growth and we may just be seeing this adjustment getting under way judging
from the gradual upcreep in initial and continuing claims  the inherently uneven nature of the stock
adjustment process and the uncertainty around it help to explain both the overall contours of the
recent data and the shortrun swings in the data and perceptions of them
a number of factors most of them mentioned by others do support expectations of
moderate growth ahead  outside the subprime market financial conditions remain supportive of
growth  intermediate and longterm rates are low in real as well as in nominal terms  the dollar
has fallen  the fallout from the recent turbulence has been very limited  aside from housing a
good portion of the inventory correction is behind us or is being put behind us  so over time
production ought to line up better with sales  both a rise in the national ism index and increases in
industrial commodity prices especially in metals support the notion of a coming recovery in
manufacturing though i admit the increase in metals prices may be a factor of the global economic
expansion as well  continued good growth of jobs to date will support increases in personal
income and as many have remarked growth in the rest of the world has been pretty strong  i was
struck by the upward revision in restofworld growth in the greenbook despite weakness in the
united states the rise in oil prices and the decline in equity values  so as karen remarked
domestic demand abroad seems to be strengthening and i think this bodes well for global external
adjustment as well as for us exports
but the information we have received over the intermeeting period not only shifted expected
growth down a little but also highlighted some downside risk to activity  in housing those
downside risks center on the implications of the subprime debacle  will it affect housing demand
will lending terms tighten beyond the subprime market and the mortgage market  how much will
tightening spill over to other lending markets such as home equity lines of credit and perhaps affect
consumer demand  the possible answers to these questions seem to me to have downside tails that
are fatter than the upside tails  unexpected weakness in investment spending outside housing and
autorelated industries is another risk factor  the question is whether this weakness represents just a
shortterm adjustment to moderate growth or whether businesses themselves see a downside shift in
underlying demand that we dont see  financial conditions may not remain as supportive of growth
besides the possibility of the dropping of other shoes such as private equity as many have
mentioned  i see a distinct downside risk to the staffs assumption of continued increases in equity
prices given the likelihood that if the economy evolves the way the staff anticipates longterm
interest rates will rise and profits will be very disappointing to market analysts
despite weaker spending we still face upside risks to the gradual downdrift in inflation
recent data havent been as favorable to deceleration as we would have hoped  softer investments
slower growth of productivity and continued strength in labor markets could suggest a slower path
of trend productivity growth  if so we would need to adjust down our expectations for growth and
labor costs would get a boost even at slower growth rates unless increases in nominal wages also
downshifted pretty promptly  good growth in labor demand could suggest a stronger path for
demand and less slack than the staff is estimating  finally the nairu could well be lower than the
5 percent that the staff is estimating especially in light of the relatively slow updrift in many
measures of compensation  but at 4 percent the unemployment rate is low by historical
standards and this suggests to me that the risks from resource utilization remain toward higher
inflation  in sum downside risks to our maximum employment objective have increased but i do
not think they outweigh the continuing upside risk to moremoderate inflation at least not yet
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me say at the outset that i believe the
moderategrowth scenario is the most likely for 2007  but as many of you have already discussed i
had thought that business fixed investment particularly was a very real upside opportunity and now
consider it a very real downside risk  the greenbook marked down bfi over the next couple of
quarters but i think theres further reason to be concerned about it
let me confine the rest of my remarks to the market tumult of the past several weeks and
give you my views on that which are broadly consistent with what bill said at the outset  first my
sense of what the markets seem to be telling us is that the real economy is weaker  the firstquarter
earnings numbers that bill showed us very much reflect a trend that we could be seeing more of and
that suggests some downside risk in the equity markets that governor kohn referred to a moment
ago  a markdown of data in the fourth quarter of 2006 disappointing data regarding business fixed
investment the weakness in the subprime market and so forth suggest to me that perhaps the
markets have been reacting to a us domestic economy that is in somewhat weaker shape than we
could have expected even a couple of months ago
what was the cause of the market tumult of the past several weeks  when markets cannot
single out a proximate cause they have a tendency either to construct one or to be completely
dismissive  in my view some subset of rather sophisticated investors over the past six months or so
have been looking for an opportunity or maybe i should say an excuse to pull back from certain
markets in which creditrisk spreads have been unusually low and over the past several weeks they
found one  there has been a generalized discomfort with markets priced for perfection and levels of
volatility that seem uncorrelated with the real world which were all trying to analyze  many of us
have noted in speeches during the past couple of quarters that we have been surprised by the level of
certainty implied in market prices and i think that message is now starting to find its way into the
marketplace  so the tumult and volatility that weve seen in the past several weeks will as it
continues make it more difficult for us to gauge whats going on
might this financial market tumult then actually affect the real economy going forward
generally i would have said that these financial market activities are quite distinct from the real
economy  but in the case of business fixed investment i cant help but believe that the market
uncertainty the talk of recession the animal spirits that certainly have been negatively affectedall
might affect some boards of directors and management teams that are trying to decide about
whether to step on the gas on capex or might get them to retreat even further  given strong balance
sheets incredibly strong operating cash flows and all of the momentum that they should have im
as puzzled as tim geithner as to why we havent seen that capital investment  the tumult in the
markets in recent weeks gives me more reason to be concerned there  perhaps these management
teams are going to find share buybacks to be even more compelling compared with the alternative
of capital investment
in general i took the volatility of the markets at first blush as probably being a proper wake
up call to folks who had gotten perhaps a little too complacent about what was going on
particularly in the credit markets  having spent a lot of time in new york in the past several weeks
i think that if that was a wakeup call many market participants seem to have hit the snooze button
laughter  many are reviewing their portfolios and risk positions certainly and we are seeing a bit
more caution  perhaps thats justified by real economic fundamentals or by some lemming
phenomenon  that is most of these investment banks and other asset managers have in front of
them as theyre making decisions a creditrisk button and a clientrisk button  over the past couple
of years they have always hit the clientrisk buttonthat is i dont want to take client risk i dont
want to lose this business  so they have hit that button and the credit markets have been so
accommodative and the syndicated markets so strong that theyve been able to make some free
money there  for a short short window after february 27 they seem poised to hit the creditrisk
button  one senior creditrisk officer at a major institution told me that he was very popular again
people wanted him in every meeting as they were making underwriting commitments  he called
me back a few days later and said no one wants to talk to me again  laughter  so i worry
whether that wakeup call has actually been felt
now could this market volatility of recent weeks spread beyond the subprime market and
lead to the kind of credit crunch that would have meaningful downside risks to the economy  i tried
to imagine the circumstances in which that would come  first i looked at financial intermediaries
and rather than trying to distinguish between commercial banks and investment banks hedge funds
and other private equity i tried to think about them as being creators of credit distributors of credit
or holders of credit forgetting all other labels that are associated with them  typically before the
rather robust capital markets of the past several years most of these institutions would decide which
of those areas they would be in   do they create products and get them off their books or do they
make big bets by deciding what to hold and not  many of them have now decided that they could
be in all three businesses  all three businesses were profitable  to the extent that a portfolio
position no longer fit they could sell it or syndicate it very quickly  in this new environment
however with new volatility these portfolio holdings over time may prove harder to liquidate and
the outofthemoney options that the creators of structured products have been writing may no
longer be free  a couple of weeks ago warren buffett described one of these financial hedge fund
phenomena  he described the groups as the innovators the imitators and then the swarming
masses of incompetents  laughter  i wont describe who is in what category in these markets
but many financial institutions seem to be following one particular premier investment bank that has
managed to be a creator of products to be a syndicator and to be taking very large principal
positions
what happens if these other financial institutions get uncomfortable as these markets
tighten to the extent that they decide that they no longer want to be in the equity bridge business
to cite one example which president fisher raised in a very large highly leveraged transaction
recently a couple of the investment banks decided to put up a couple billion dollars of capital and
they were short some equity checks  typically they would then go to a series of other banks bring
them into the deal and then try to syndicate that quickly  but the first investment banks that were
involved wanted to make sure that there was no competition in the syndicated market  so three
nonus financial institutions wrote 1 billion checks for an extremely small fee and agreed to hold
that billion dollars of equity on their own balance sheets for a term of not less than 365 days and to
syndicate it later only to those who would be satisfactory to the lead investment banks  to what
extent over the next twelve months will they and others feel uncomfortable in this new business
environment with that kind of equity exposure  if that process ends up being disorderly there could
be a rapid turn to risk aversion  of course i think the more likely case is that this is orderly and
supportive of sustainable growth but thats the financial situation in which i would get very nervous
very quickly
i think a second mechanism by which the situation could become worse involves a whole
set of legal risks around the subprime markets and uncertainty generally over where liability rests
through the good intentions of policymakers in the congress and in state legislatures some
uncertainty could be introduced into the foreclosure market and into the syndication markets many
enterprising state attorneys general seem poised to do just the same and that kind of legal risk could
be very dangerous for these credit markets
finally what does that situation mean for us  i suspect that besides our needing to keep a
focus on these financial markets it is whats happening in the real economy  as well discuss a bit
more tomorrow our statement should be and will necessarily be read in the context of our reaction
to incoming real data as opposed to our reaction to whats happening in the financial markets
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i very much agree with president sterns
characterization that although some of the incoming data are a bit weaker than we had been seeing
we certainly shouldnt overreact  optimally we should react to what the data tell us about the
future and im not sure weve learned an enormous amount about the future over the past few
months  actually dave has kept a very steady hand on the forecast throttle because we have seen a
lot of data come in over the past six months but they havent led to much change in the greenbook
forecast and i think thats quite reasonable  given that some of the numbers have come in slightly
weaker and given some of the market volatility i think that uncertainty is a bit up so the tails are
somewhat fatter and i agree with the number of people who had said that
quickly looking at gdp from the c  i  g  net exports context i think net exports will be
reasonably robust as world growth at least over the next few quarters is going to be fairly strong
we also heard a lot of anecdotal support for that  on both the state and federal levels government
spending is likely to continue at a pace that will certainly not reduce demand and may have the
potential to add to demand  but when it comes to consumption and investment thats where the
uncertainties are  i wont restate the concerns that several of you have raised about the deepening
puzzle in investment  i mentioned this at the last meetingthat for many months weve been
seeing very good balance sheets good employment numbers good sentiment good returns and so
on and so forth but no pickup in investment  given that weve now gone at least six months
without seeing that pickup i am concerned that with the greater uncertainty that seems to be in the
markets we may not see that pickup and that somehow our models may be missing something that
should be in there but that has not been there in the past
the other area of the greatest uncertainty is related to the subprime market  as you know
now we and the other federal regulators put out for commentactually right at the end of the week
of the increased concern about volatility in the subprime marketguidance with respect to
subprime mortgages the socalled 228s and 327s  that is still out for comment  were very
mindful of some of the comments that have been raised here about whether that could
inappropriately reduce the supply of credit in this market and in the notice of proposed rulemaking
we have really emphasized questions about what the unintended consequences are  so we want to
make sure that we get information in on that  some loans that were made may have been
inappropriate but there may have been some that were completely appropriate  we want to make
sure that when we put out the guidance we dont choke off the appropriate loans
the supervision and regulation staff has surveyed five active lenders in the subprime market
that represent about 30 percent of that market  weve gotten data so far from three of the five
from some of them its a bit difficult to get the data quickly because of a fair amount of
management turnover but we are still working on it  but i think its a healthy thing that there are
some delays  whats interesting is that one of the main concerns is refinancing  what will happen
to these guys because this market seems to be drying up  as we discussed at the beginning its
really the variablerate subprime market  the subprime market is roughly 13 percent of the total
mortgages outstanding  the variablerate subprime is about 74 percent of total mortgages
outstanding nearly twothirds of the subprime market  the fixedrate part has not had any uptick in
delinquencies  because of the inversion of the yield curve the people who may be facing increases
in their variable rates may be able to refinance into fixedrate subprimes  over 06 the average
introductory adjustablerate subprime mortgages were in the 7 percent to 9 percent areadepending
on the loantovalue ratio debttoincome ratio and so forthif income was stated  right now to
refinance into fixed rate the range is about 7 percent to 9 percent  its fairly similar so many of
these people may be able to move into this area
one thing that we want to know is what happens after people get these loans  what do they
do with them next  in the survey about 25 percent of the loans were retained by the individual
banks and so we could follow through what happened to the borrowers when they refinanced but
we see only 25 percent  obviously this share could be heavily selective but it still may be
somewhat interesting to know that about 40 percent of those on whom we have some information
actually moved into a prime product  about 34 percent went into a fixed subprime and the rest
about 25 percent refinanced to another type of variable subprime  so a fair number of these are
able to move either into prime or into fixed subprime  although this sample is obviously selective
it says something about the likely effects going forward  the benefits at least in the short run of
the inverted yield curve are that many of these individuals will have a lot of opportunities to
refinance into a fixed product that will have payments similar to the ones that theyre paying now
rather than ones that would be much higher
that said the situation suggests that the concerns about what will happen to the market may
not be as strong as some people have said  we still dont know as president fisher said a lot about
the alta market  that market almost by definition is low documentation or no documentation  the
fico scores tend to be higher  from the survey a lot of these people appear to be selfemployed
so it becomes more difficult to independently verify the income that they have  thats a large part
of the market but obviously potentially a very risky part of the market  fortunately its not an
enormous part of the market and so it doesnt seem to be a major challenge going forward
certainly there are some potential challenges but i think some of the data from the survey are
interesting
with respect to inflation pressures i think very much like dave now that hes a much more
balanced person than he was earlier in 2006 that we see neither intensifying nor abating
inflationary pressures  you know some of the numbers more recently have not been as favorable as
they could be but they are certainly by no means out of control  expectations continue to appear
well anchored and well contained  we dont know a lot about whats driving shortterm to
intermediateterm inflation dynamics  its hard to see lots of correlations with unemployment rates
economic activity resource utilization energy prices and other things  i have been hoping to see
and we have been seeing a gradual downtrend that seems to be flattening out to neither intensifying
nor abating which leaves us with some concerns going forward about the upside potential to
inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  one way i think about the situation is to
compare whats happening now not to the last meeting but to two meetings before  from
december to january we had positive news  now we have gone from january to march and weve
had negative news  when you look at the overall picture were not in a very different place from
where we were in december although i do think that theres actually more uncertainty around the
forecast  so let me go into a little more detail on this  im much less worried about the housing
market as a serious downside risk  first of all i do see signs of stabilization of demand and i really
agree very much with what randy just discussed  first of all this market is a fairly small part of the
overall mortgage market  also there are ways for people to work out their situations  so the
subprime market has really been overplayed in the media and i do not see it as that big a downside
risk  i am comfortable with the fact that we have lowered our forecast on housing a bit but the
numbers that just came in recently were actually ones that indicate some stabilization therein
terms of housing demand in particular
when i worry about the risk to the forecast im really much more worried about capital
expenditure in terms of investment  the problem here is that the fundamentals look fairly strong
and yet we havent seen strong business fixed investment  i ask myself well whats going on
one possibility is that in fact there will be a bouncebackthat these strong fundamentals in terms
of balance sheets and so forth will produce actually stronger investment in the future and i think
that is a significant possibility  however im really a bit more worried that the weak capital
expenditures may indicate that something deeper is wrong in terms of the fundamentals  in
particular im a bit worried about the issue of what could be happening to productivity in the future
weve seen some weaker numbers in terms of productivity and we think that is just sort of cyclical
and not a change in structural productivity  but maybe the business sector is seeing something that
were not seeing and in that context businesses may not be investing as much because they dont
see that productivity will be that strong in the future  they dont see the returns in the future and so
theyre not investing as much  thats actually bad news in several dimensions  one dimension
would be that it would actually indicate a serious downside risk in terms of aggregate demand  also
if productivity is lower thats not a good thing for inflation  so the situation here is one about
which im not super worried but the environment is more complicated and it makes our jobs more
interesting  laughter  there is of course the chinese curse that you should live through
interesting times but well have moreinteresting fomc meetings
on the inflation front i am comfortable with the view that the greenbook and others have
expressed that we should expect some moderate decrease in inflation  in fact the latest data dont
really get me that nervous on this  however we must recognize that when we have moreanchored
inflation expectations its actually harder to forecast the little blips in inflation because whats really
going on is whats leftit is no longer the trend but just the transitory movements and those are
particularly hard to forecast  so there is a bad side to the overall better news but i think the key is
that inflation expectations seem to be very solidly grounded  its hard to know exactly what the
numbers are but they seem to be around 2 percent  so its realistic to think that in fact inflation is
going to move toward the 2 percent level although there may be some blips up and down
however it is also important to recognize that i dont see any reason for its dropping much below
that  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you very much for the comments  im
going to offer as i always do a brief summary and invite any comments and corrections and then
id like to add a few comments of my own  most participants today agree that growth looks as
though its going to be slower but there is some diversity of opinion about how persistent the
slowdown would be  many people have marked down growth expectations for the remainder of the
year and there was a general sense that the uncertainty about growth prospects and downside risk
have increased  however some people saw the current slowdown as only a soft patch that would
be reversed soon  housing remains weak and some participants noted the risk that problems in
mortgage and credit markets and increased foreclosure rates might contribute to further weakness
however others felt that the housing situation has not changed materially since the last meeting
the slowdown in capital investment drew more concern in part because it has proved difficult to
explain  an inventory correction continues but automobile inventories have been brought into line
some factors that will support growth include a booming global economy and stronger government
spending at both the federal and the state and local levels  the labor market continues to be tight
with some noting increases in wages  developments in the labor housing and credit markets will
be important in determining the future course of consumption
several participants pointed to potential financial risks including possible knockon effects
of the subprime mortgage problems and the possibility of the drying up of currently abundant
liquidity and financial markets  corporate earnings are also likely to slow  if these risks
materialize they could add to downside pressures on output  however some thought that financial
conditions will remain supportive  some but not all think that inflation will continue to moderate
albeit very slowly  there is general disappointment with recent inflation readings and some were
skeptical that any meaningful progress against inflation is being made  in particular resource
utilization pressures particularly tight labor markets pose a longerterm inflation threat  import
prices and slower productivity growth also add to inflation risk  the views of most participants
were that upside inflation risks still outweigh downside risks to output that uncertainty has
increased and that the tails of the distribution have become fatter
are there comments  if not let me just add a few thoughts  its very difficult to speak
lastall the good ideas have already been presented  so ill say just a few things
i think the growth outlook is slightly worse  the housing market is of course central to
nearterm developments  the central scenario that housing will stabilize sometime during the
middle of the year remains intact but there have been a few negative innovations  weve noted the
subprime issues and the possibility of foreclosures reduced confidence and tightened credit terms
and ive also noted that reports from builders about the spring selling season have not been
particularly upbeat in general  at the same time we continue to see rough stability in sales starts
and permits  the effects of the decline in subprime lending may have already been mostly seen
since that has slowed from last fall  mortgage rates of course remain quite low and the labor
market is a key determinant of housing demand and of mortgage delinquencies particularly cross
sectionally  across the country theres a very close correlation between foreclosure rates and state
unemployment rates  so long as the labor market remains strong i would think that the general
health of the housing market would be improving  the housing market i think will follow the
same scenario but there are a few negative innovations
there was a lot of discussion about capital investments and i share the puzzlement about
why thats happening  like governor mishkin i am concerned that it might signal something about
productivity  another possibility in the current environment goes back to my phd thesis on the
effects of uncertainty on investment which found that greater uncertainty can make people delay
their commitments  in our last meeting we discussed the possible upside risk to consumption  i
think that risk is much diminished now  our retail sales have been quite flat and the strong growth
of consumption in the first quarter is almost entirely due to the december blip which will carry
through to the quarterly arithmetic  but consumption is very likely to slow  gas prices are another
reason that consumption is likely to slow  the labor market again remains strong  i agree with the
greenbook that there is some likelihood of softening going forward  in particular i think governor
kohn mentioned that the slowing productivity growth were seeing could be consistent with some
labor hoarding in this late stage of the cycle
again ive marked down my growth expectations only a bit but if we were handicapping
recessions im afraid that risk has probably gone up a bit  i would cite at least three reasons  first
there seems to be a pretty good chance that potential output growth is lower than in the past and
almost by definition if growth is lower then the chance of negative quarters is greater  second the
greenbook has a 60 basis point increase in unemployment occurring stably over the next two years
if that happens it will be the first time it has ever happened  laughter  generally speaking
increases in unemployment tend either not to occur or to be bigger than 60 basis points  finally
weve discussed the financial market sensitivities which are having an effect so that changes in the
outlook could have pretty substantial feedback effects onto the economy through the stock market
other financial markets and credit markets  so i think as president fisher does that the tail in that
direction is unfortunately somewhat fatter
likewise with inflation the news was disappointing  we knew that there would beand
we have seenmonthtomonth volatility  it is difficult as president pianalto noted to make a firm
conclusion based on the recent data about whether or not inflation is moderating  i would just note
that rents and owners equivalent rent are still pretty important here  they have not yet slowed
much which may have to do with the nature of the uncertainties about the housing market  that
possibility will be helpful going forward  at an earlier meeting i indicated that medical costs were a
risk and they have indeed proved to be a risk
speaking about inflation makes me reflect on the difficulties of measuring aggregate supply
in general  as we think about the economy going forward we face two countervailing possibilities
one which i and several others have already mentioned is that potential output growth may well be
lower than many outsiders and maybe even the greenbook think  obviously that will make it
difficult to get economic slack and will make this situation much more challenging  at the same
time the lack of wage acceleration at least raises the possibility that the nairu might be somewhat
lower than 5 percent which would be helpful in the other direction  with respect to inflation again
as i said im disappointed by the recent numbers  i dont get a sense from business people or from
surveys and so on that the general publics worry about inflation has increased very much except
insofar as they perceive that inflation is constraining the fed from acting  so again i dont think
weve seen an adverse breakout by any means but obviously were going to have to remain very
vigilant and make sure that we maintain our credibility on the inflation front
as the last item i would like vincent to distribute table 1  we made a couple of changes in
the description of the economy  he can make a few comments and then everyone will have an
opportunity to look at it overnight and we can discuss the communication issues tomorrow
mr reinhart2  i have the unenviable position of being the last speed bump between
you and the open bar across the street  laughter  in the interest of time id like to draw your
attention to the latest version of table 1 and then deliver the rest of my remarks tomorrow  that way
youll get a chance to cogitate over the changes to the table overnight and i will get to showcase an
outfit that i anticipate will be just as fetching as this one tomorrow  laughter  the latest version of
table 1 which was just distributed introduces modified wording in the rationale portion of
alternative b  in section 2 the factors supporting growth are made a little more explicit including
some of the things that youve spoken about todayfavorable financial conditions and the recent
mixed indicators  as for section 3 the cpi release was a touch to the high side of expectations and
the medical services component of the ppi even more so  this situation makes it likely that the core
pce price index will be disappointing and argues for substituting material similar to the bracketed
material in the bluebook  as for the risk assessment this draft continues to characterize inflation as
the committees principal concern although some of you would prefer to identify it as your
predominant concern partly because of the precedential use of that word in the chairmans
monetary policy testimony  i hope for your sake that your hotel rooms have both a gideons bible
and an unabridged dictionary  laughter  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  i hope youll join me now in bidding farewell to
governor bies  we will reconvene tomorrow at 900 am

meeting recessed
march 21 2007morning session
chairman bernanke  vincent
mr reinhart  thank you mr chairman
ms minehan  how nice you look today
mr reinhart  thank you  that will be noted in the transcript  laughter
mr plosser  i liked his red vest better
mr reinhart3  that wont be noted in the transcript  laughter  ill be referring to the materials right in front of you  financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period amid a repricing of risky assets  as can be seen in the top left panel of your first exhibit monetary policy expectations shifted down almost  percentage point on net at longer horizons and uncertainty about that path the top middle panel spiked higher  investors now admit the possibility of much lower policy rates just six months from nowthe red bars in the top right panelcompared with the hollow dashed bars witnessed at the time of the january meeting  a part of this downward revision was due to concerns that strains in the subprime mortgage market would leave a more significant mark on spending than previously suspected as shown by the blue line in the middle left panel the spread on the bbbminus rated tranche of a cds index covering subprime mortgages that were originated in the first half of last year ballooned in response to remarkably poor payment performance  about the same time that investors rethought the prospects for the mortgage market they marked down the prices of equities considerably the bottom left panel  the combination of lower equity prices and an expectation of markedly easier future monetary policy presumably signals that markets think the prospects for economic growth are now less bright
against this backdrop nominal tenyear treasury yields fell about 40 basis points as shown by the dotted blue line in the right panel  longerterm tips yields the red dashed line fell as much as their nominal counterparts leaving inflation compensation little changed  the tenyear bbb corporate yield the solid black line followed the downward track of comparable treasury yields until february 27 keeping the corresponding spread little changed  since february 27 this risk spread like others has widened modestly  as shown in the top panel of exhibit 2 the yield on the twoyear treasury note remains well below the intended federal funds rate
the last time this spread was so decidedly negative was in 2000 the shaded area late in the previous economic expansion  as shown in the middle left panel the committee began 2000 with three successive policy tightenings which brought the federal funds rate to 6 percent  at those meetings market participants had expected some firmingthat is shown by the dotted lines plotting the path of the expected federal funds rate for each meeting  by summer however investors had taken out

3  material used by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 3
the anticipation of firming subsequently they priced in policy ease  this occurred as forecasts for real activity softened as shown at the middle right by the blue chip consensus forecasts for real gdp growth over 2001 the solid line and for the annual average 2001 unemployment rate the dotted line  as noted in the bottom left panel in the first seven meetings of the year the committee held that the balance of risks was tilted toward heightened inflation pressuresin part it seems from rereading the transcripts because no one wanted to be seen as lacking vigilance against inflation
three lessons from this experience are noted at the bottom right  first statement language can hamper your flexibility  second downward moves in financial market yields can be informative  third those forwardlooking adjustments in financial markets can help to offset the effects of gradualism in policymaking
in writing the bluebook we tried to offer a greater measure of flexibility for policy going forward in alternatives a and b  you might want that flexibility if you harbor serious concerns about the housing market the subject of the top panels of exhibit 3  in particular some members might be of the view that the turmoil in the subprime market may prompt a significant pullback in funding for housing steepening the slide in home sales the left panel at the same time homebuying attitudes the middle panel have improved no doubt in part because the drop in market yields has pulled down mortgage rates for prime borrowers the right panel given these crosscurrents you might be inclined to await more information and be prepared to move in either direction when the time comes  waiting a bit might not seem so costly in that the real federal funds rate the solid line in the middle panel is right on top of the equilibrium real federal funds rate consistent with the greenbook forecast  by that measure at least maintaining the current real federal funds rate at 3 percent would imply closing the output gap in the next couple of years  keeping the fed funds rate steady for a time is the prescription from the standard optimal control exercise with the frbus model with a 2 percent inflation goal the solid lines in the bottom panels  as explained in a recent memo and a bluebook box the inertia of inflation in the frbus model is due importantly to the sluggishness of inflation expectations  if you believe that the public could be made to understand an inflation goal of 1 percent relatively quickly and costlessly perhaps as in the immediate recognition scenario plotted as the dashed lines you might not feel the need to hurry to move the fed funds rate even if your inflation target was 1 percent
this was the first bluebook in some time that fully lived up to its official title monetary policy alternatives  that is we provided three alternatives for the level of the intended federal funds rate  the policy easing of alternative a and the firming of alternative c however may have an air of unreality to them because market participants seem so firmly convinced that you will stand pat today and i will expand on that issue with the aid of exhibit 4  the top panel plots the estimated effects of fomc policy announcements on nearterm policy expectations over the past six years  to be sure a 25 basis point cut or hike would translate into a 25 basis point surprise something that has not been seen since 2001  by the way the coloring of the bars exposes regularity in your behavior  policy easings the red bars tend to be surprises whereas firmings the blue ones tend to be more predictable  that is
youve shown a revealed preference to be more willing to surprise markets on the downside than on the upside  but before you obsess too much on the perils of surprising markets in general i would note that when the bank of england tightened 25 basis points on january 11 fiftyone out of the fiftyone economists surveyed by bloomberg just before the meeting had expected no change  as shown in the middle left panel rates did rise that day but by a muted amount at longer maturities  as shown at the middle right the imprint on tenyear gilt yields was not long lasting nor was implied volatility deflected from its downward track  as to the direction of the potential policy surprise the case for alternative a as laid out in the bottom panels probably rests on the belief that the ongoing weakness in the housing sector will intensify and be joined by softness in some other sector  one candidate is business spending given that as at the left purchasing managers see business conditions as treading water and as at the right view their customers inventories as too high
the policy ease in alternative a and perhaps even the holding pattern of alternative b might come at the cost of an increase in expected inflation a concern that would be at the forefront for anyone inclined to the 25 basis point firming of alternative c the subject of exhibit 5  as shown in the top panel inflation expectations as surveyed from households the solid line or professional forecasters the dotted line remain above what many of you have identified as your comfort zone for inflation  the apparent poor alignment of these expectations with some of your statements may incline you to a demonstration effect of your resolve  you may view this as necessary merely to hold the line on inflation  the unemployment rate plotted in the middle left panel remains 4 percent consistent with a traditional view of pressures on resources  you might also be taking a cue from our trading partners last quarter the arithmetic contribution of the improvement in real net exports to gdp growth was 1 percentage points and as shown in the table at the middle right the staff forecasts foreign economic growth to continue to expand robustly  the fact that the recent angst about the us expansion is not widely shared internationally may lend some comfort that economic growth at home still has a firm footing  you might also view this meeting as an opportunity to set market participants straight about your priorities  policy firming would disabuse people of the notion that the fomc responds mechanically to a decline in stock prices  indeed the stilllow level of implied volatilities as in the bottom left panel may suggest that investors maintain the faith that monetary policy will smooth every road  the bottom right panel plots fiveminute changes in the sp 500 along the horizontal axis against fiveminute changes in the oneyearahead eurodollar futures rate along the vertical axis since february 27  in the past few weeks interest rate expectations have been very responsive to equity pricespossibly suggesting a widespread belief that the fomc supports equity prices
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for vincent  governor
kohn
mr kohn  vincent on exhibit 2 the twoyear treasury spread over the target federal
funds rate for a while we have been discounting the tendency of the tenyear rate to be below the
fed funds rate because term premiums have been unusually low so weve said its not as
indicative of expected weakness  are term premiums low for the twoyear rate or do we know
mr reinhart  to start where we are now to get to about 25 basis points or zero at
the tenyear mark you probably should smooth across the maturity structure  yes indeed the
twoyear term premiums are lower so some of the low level of the spread does reflect less
compensation for risk  at the same time we havent done much to change our estimates of term
premiums at very short maturities and the implied sets of futures rates do point downward and
give you 75 basis points of easing in the next year
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  i had essentially the same question  if you take the twoyear rate over the
past year how much of that could be explained by a change in the term premium  you said term
premiums are low but im talking about the change
mr reinhart  you have to go back about two years  the term premium started
declining about two years ago
mr poole  but quantitatively how big is that
mr reinhart  quantitatively a good portion is due to lower term premiums
mr poole  okay  but then does that have much bearing on lets say eurodollar
futures a year or a year and a half out
mr reinhart  well youd assume that there are arbitrage opportunities across the
collection of fixedincome securities and lower term premiums in the treasury market are not a
peculiar attribute just for the treasury market  they say something about investors attitudes
toward risk and perception of risk and that should be reflected in all fixedincome securities  so
yes we think those term premiums are lower everywhere
mr poole  but if we take the change in the eurodollar market just since the last
fomc meeting or take your exhibit 1 the top righthand panel or the top lefthand panel my
instinct is that it has to reflect almost entirely changes in market views about the future fed funds
rate
mr reinhart  i think your instinct would be guided by the top middle panel which
shows that implied volatility went up which would not be consistent with term premiums going
down  we would first see at the very short end that the sensitivity of the term premiums to
volatilities is lower than it is with longer capital instruments and then would interpret the shift in
the upper left panel as reflecting expectations about policy
mr poole  thank you
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  if not were ready for our
policy goround  president poole
mr poole  first of all i like alternative b  ill start with that  i think we have a
couple of issues that are pulling in different directions  vince talked about this a bit  a lot of
people in the market seem to believe that de facto our inflation objective is more like 1 to
2 percent  they dont really believe 1 to 2  that may mean a lot of resistance in the
marketplace to revisions of expectations which tends to feed through the whole economy and to
keep current inflation higher than would otherwise be the case  clearly we dont want to do
anything that would reinforce the markets view that were willing to keep the current inflation
rate or that our upper end is 2 percent  i think that theres a lot to be said for stating that our
inflation objective is 1 percent plus or minus   however the whole rationale of trying to
have very firmly entrenched inflation expectations in the market is to maximize employment and
growth over the long run and to reduce the cyclical effects on employment  inflation is an
inertial process and we would like to avoid a situation in which we hang on longer than is really
necessary so that employment is driven down if the economy generates some cumulative
weakness  thats a major part of the policy problem
so i asked myself this question  the market anticipates lets say by the end of 2008 a
fed funds rate that is 75 basis points below the staff assumption in the greenbooki think 75 is
the right number  wouldnt it be desirable for us to try to change the markets expectation on the
fed funds rate to match our own greenbook expectation  my answer is clearly no  there is a
lot to be said for allowing market fluctuations in rates to help stabilize the economy and i think
that vince was getting at this point in talking about the experience in the last downturnthat the
market can help stabilize the real economy by moving rates  we can avoid sending wrong
signals about our longerrun inflation objectives by delaying any policy response and letting the
market do a lot of the stabilization work for us in terms of the real economy  obviously if the
economy eventually weakens we have to follow through  the statement language goes very
much in that direction perhaps as much as we can possibly craft  so i really like the policyno
change in the rateand the language that are in alternative b  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i am inclined toward leaving the rate
unchanged so that would be alternative b  id like to comment on a couple of things  although
the downside risk to growth appears to have increased somewhat on a national level since the last
meeting i continue to expect that we will see a pickup in the economy as i said yesterday over
the year  at the same time i am obviously disappointed as others are that the recent inflation
numbers have not continued to show the progress we saw last fall  consequently i think that the
risk of inflation will remain above acceptable levels for a while and that situation on balance
outweighs the downside risk to growth  so while i favor no change in policy i also continue to
favor statement language that reflects an explicit bias toward firming or that makes it very clear
to the market that we will remain firm until we actually see the inflation numbers consistently
improve
that leads me to the issue of the statement  im open to the language there but i like the
wording that the committees principal policy or predominant whichever you prefer
concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  im a little uneasy
about the part that says that future policy adjustments will be dependent on events  i think it
should say something along the lines of the extent and timing of any additional firming so that
we dont confirm the markets view that we will see a drop of as much as 75 basis points in the
fed funds rate in the future  our most likely events are to hold firm as we go forward and id
like to convey that to the market one way or another  im open as to whether or not we do that
by saying that the bias is still on the upside  im more concerned that by saying that were going
to look for data in the future as defining which way we go we will confirm the lower rates in the
markets and that will complicate our job rather than simplify it  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i also favor keeping the federal funds rate at
the current level  as many people remarked yesterday that probably stands the best chance for
now anyhow of keeping growth at a reasonably good rate and reducing inflation at least a little
further albeit graduallythe best chance that is of coming closest to our dual objectives  we
are presented with some challenges here on communications  the incoming data certainly have
resulted in a downward adjustment to expected growth and i have highlighted some downside
risk on the activity side  but output is still running close to potential in level terms it might
even be beyond potential so its not a big problem  i think we all see the risk that inflation
wont moderate as still being substantial and probably greater than the risk of a shortfall in
output  so our challenge is to recognize that the real economy has shifted somewhat but not a
lot while avoiding giving the impression that were reacting in any way to the financial market
developments maintaining our primary emphasis on inflation risks and i hope not inducing a
further decline in expected federal funds rates  i agree with president poole that the market
constructively is building in its own expectations but we shouldnt push them ourselves  im not
sure its possible to meet all these goals  laughter
alternative b comes as close as i think i could come in acknowledging the mixed data
but emphasizing that we expect moderate growth ahead emphasizing that the recent readings on
inflation have been too highparticularly the shift from last time which suggested that we had
been a little disappointed in the inflation and the inflation risksand pointing out that the
committees principal policy concern remains that inflation will fail to moderate as expected
as for principal versus predominant im sort of indifferent  i guess id lean slightly in the
direction of predominant for the reason that vincent gaveyou used predominant in your
testimony mr chairman  but its not a big deal
i think my preference here partly reasoning from the fall of 2000 would be to give as
honest a representation of our views as possible and to downgrade our worry about how the
financial markets are going to react  i myself am a little haunted by november 2000 when
things were slipping away and the committee was afraid to shift its views because we were
afraid of the effect on financial markets  there was a lot of discussion at that meeting and i
think in retrospect that we look a little silly  so i think i would go with alternative b as stated
here  if the markets rally a little so be it  from my perspective this is as good an outline of
where i think the committee is as i could put together  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as has already been suggested i too favor
maintaining the fed funds rate today at 5 percent  as i said in the first goround the data we
have received since the last meeting have certainly increased my uncertainty about the forecast
but i think that the fundamentals havent changed that much  besides as we discussed
yesterday the earlier signs of moderating inflation seem to have ebbed somewhat and inflation
still seems to be higher than id like to see  so i am still concerned about the upside risk to
inflation  although my uncertainty about real growth has grown somewhat it does not
overcome my concern about inflation at this point  thus until i see moreconvincing evidence
that the economic weakness we see cropping up here and there will be deeper and longer lived i
would favor maintaining the current fed funds rate  the combination of temporarily slower
growth with a constant fed funds rate in my view does represent a modest firming of policy
which i think will have desirable effects both on inflation and on our credibility  cutting rates at
this time it seems to me is inappropriate as its unlikely to have a significant effect on the
weakness in real output or investment in the short run in that the absolute levels of longterm real
rates remain relatively low  moreover a cut in the rates is likely to signal to the markets that we
are much less concerned about inflation than we previously indicated and that we are willing to
forgo our inflation objective in search of modest increases in real growth  i simply dont believe
that we can finetune with such precision and we shouldnt encourage the markets to believe that
we can do so  such a move might also have undesirable consequences for our reputation and
credibility  it also might put us on a downward path that we may find hard to resist and thus put
our inflation objectives at risk  in other words before we take a step to cut rates we need to
have a much clearer picture of where were going and i think we dont have that yet  however
if the data evolve so as to suggest that the slowdown is going to worsen the fomc clearly
would need to allow the fed funds rate to fall with equilibrium real rates but only to a level and at
a pace that are consistent with making progress on our goal of price stability  nevertheless now
is not the time for that
turning to language regarding the new alternative b that you gave us yesterday im
actually pretty happy with most of that language  i think section 2 does a very good job and im
fairly comfortable with the language in section 3  as ive said before although i am skeptical
about inflation pressures moderating on their own i cannot bring myself to endorse the language
of potential of capacity utilization  my reading of empirical evidence is that it casts serious
doubt on the usefulness of such measures to forecast inflation  i dont like the idea of
perpetuating in the marketplace a belief that it might be useful because in the long run it can
damage our own credibility  but youve heard me say that before and i wont belabor that point
any further  the final section on the balance of risks is the most significant part of this
statement and i have a couple of points to make there  frankly im pretty happy with the way
the new version reads  i think it represents a slight recognition that the economy has weakened
without being very explicit about it its more of an implicit acknowledgement  so i could live
with the language as it is proposed
president hoenig suggested that he would like firming  i guess im a little torn  im
sympathetic with that point of view but as i suggested if in fact the real rate is falling by our
holding the rate constant we are actually making a slight firming of policy  im not sure the
markets fully understand that subtletyof either that language or that view of policybut i
think it might be helpful to communicate it at some point which is back to the communication
issue  so frankly im pretty happy with leaving the fed funds rate as it is and i could live with
the language in alternative b as it is
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also favor leaving our policy rate
unchanged today and i support the language in alternative b although i find myself sympathetic
to the assessment of risk language in alternative a  the incoming information we have received
since our last meeting has led me to believe that the economy may not be as firmly footed as i
thought at our last meeting  however my sentiment about the underlying strength in the
economy has taken more than a few turns in the past year and i think the assessment of risk
language in alternative a may convey greater certainty over these realside risks than i think we
currently know  so i think that removing the additional firming phrase that weve been using
for some time more accurately reflects how the softer tone in the incoming data has influenced
my assessment of risks  its still my view that the predominant risk that we face comes from the
possibility that were not making the kind of progress we want to make against the inflation trend
that i believe our policies are trying to engineer  so im comfortable with no change in the fed
funds rate today and the language in alternative b  i am indifferent about the issue of whether
we use principal or predominant  i think that perhaps because youve used the word
predominant in your testimony using it here helps us but i can go either way  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much mr chairman  i too am very much in favor of
staying put with our current stance of policy  as i said yesterday my own sense as i listened to
the commentary around the table is not terribly different from that of everybody elsea sense
that risks have risen on both sides of the forecast  but im still willing to believe that we are
really more in an ebbandflow process here as we were last fall and that the underlying
strength of the economy is such that the chances going forward are that were on fairly solid
footing  in that regard i would like to stay where we are  i would like to have a little more
pressure on inflation to prevent it from moving up in the future and to keep it on the downward
trajectory thats in the greenbook forecast  so for all those reasons im comfortable with
alternative b with staying put  although i think that vince is right on the markthat its a good
thing we now have a set of alternativesi think that having that set is reflective of the
underlying risks in the economy  we are doing ourselves a favor by looking seriously at whether
or not we should move down stay put or go up at this time because there are arguments in all
three directions depending on where you come out on the risks to the economy  so i was glad to
see that evolution of the bluebook
in terms of language for alternative b in general im pretty happy with it  if it were just
up to me i would go with a shorter form of section 2  i would not put in the list of things that
are supporting the moderate pace of expansion over the coming quarters  i would just leave that
alone and let the two sentences stand on their ownthat recent indicators have been mixed the
adjustment to the housing sector is ongoing but the economy seems likely to continue expanding
at a moderate pace  i just think that not modifying it by all the things that we expect to continue
to be strong allows us a bit more flexibility going forward  it doesnt give the market a lot of
things to watch in particular  to some degree mentioning financial conditions as still favorable
heightens the markets attention to our attention to financial conditions if that makes any sense
to anybody  it just elevates that consideration to something with which im really not all that
comfortable  i think were better off with a simple statement that the economy still seems on
track from the perspective of growth  the inflation statement in section 3 is right on  i like the
way its stated  i could go with either principal or predominantprincipal seems a little
softer than predominant but thats just a matter of taste  i do take the point that the second
sentence in the assessment of riskthat future policy adjustments depend on the evolution rather
than the assumption of the next one being a tighteningis a big change and i think the markets
are going to see it as a big change  it is appropriately reflective of what i heard around the table
yesterday and what we ought to be thinking about at this time  so im very much in favor of that
way of talking in this announcement  but i think we ought to recognize that the markets are
going to see it as a big change  so with a little modification im on board with alternative b
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well im largely in agreement with all ive
heard around the table so far this morning  as others have commented i think yesterdays
discussion and the incoming data on the economy suggest that uncertainty about the outlook in
terms of both growth and inflation has increased at least a bit but i dont think they provide a
significant reason to change policy and adjust the federal funds rate at this point  so i continue
to favor alternative b and most of the language associated with it  im perfectly happy with
sections 2 and 4 as drafted  with regard to section 3 although i can certainly go with it as it is i
would suggest replacing the second sentence in section 3 alternative b with the second sentence
from alternative c and let it go at that  i would do that to highlight the uncertainty that
surrounds the judgment that inflation is going to moderate or decelerate a bit from here  so i
think that highlighting that has some value and it is consistent with our concernsthat a lot of
uncertainty is associated with thisand it would be valuable to get that thought in there  thats
my one suggestion  thank you
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i support the bluebook alternative b both
leaving the federal funds rate unchanged and also the language basically as it stands  i think the
current stance of policy is likely to foster an economy that gradually moves toward a soft landing
of the type portrayed in the greenbook forecast but obviously i have become much more
focused on the downside risk to economic activity since we met in january  on the inflation
front the news hasnt much altered my view  i still think core inflation is likely to edge down
this year and next but i certainly think its too soon to conclude that any new lower trend has set
in  and i do definitely see upside risks given that labor markets are still somewhat tight oil
prices have risen and the dollar has fallen  so for me the risks do seem more balanced in the
sense that there are downside risks to real activity and upside risks to inflation and i think it is
appropriatei agree with cathys commentsto reflect that in the statement  for a minute i
contemplated supporting the language about the risk assessment in alternative a but really upon
further reflection i like alternative b very much  the shift to future policy adjustments from
firming appropriately hints at downside risk as we all recognized in our discussion yesterday
i agree with vince that it creates greater policy flexibility for us and lets the market work in this
stabilizing manner  even so it does retain an asymmetric bias which i think markets expect
and i consider it reasonable because on the whole i do remain somewhat more concerned about
inflation risk and it is wise for our message on that to be consistent over time
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  as i mentioned yesterday my overall
assessment of the economy calls for growth to average somewhat below potential in 07 and to
improve in 08 and i expect labor markets will remain tight with the unemployment rate staying
below 5 percent  core inflation is higher than i like  i see some forces that will help moderate
inflation toward 2 percent but im concerned that these will not be strong enough to push
inflation below 2 percent within a reasonable time frame  so while i recognize the downside risk
to growth i still think the inflation situation poses the greater risk and at this point the costs of a
policy mistake on inflation are greater than those of a mistake on growth  the weak growth
environment does suggest that the shortterm equilibrium real interest rate may be lower now if
so then maintaining the fed funds rate at 5 percent may provide a bit more policy restraint and
with it somewhat more impetus for reducing inflation  however the analysis in the bluebook
suggests that this effect will be minor beyond the near term  so with the increased uncertainty
over the growth outlook since our last meeting it seems reasonable to continue to hold policy
steady while we gather more information  so i do favor alternative b
let me make some comments on the language  i agree with cathy minehans comment
on section 2of stopping the statement after the phrase moderate pace over coming quarters
just put a period there  i agree with everything she said as reasons for taking out the additional
language and i would just add that as now written it mentions housing again  so housing is
mentioned twice in that section and i think its unnecessary to add those additional phrases at
the end  the statement comes out much more succinct and focused if we stop it after the phrase
coming quarters  on the question about predominant versus principal i prefer sticking
with predominant since it was used before in your testimony  it would be my guess that the
definition is probably the same  i dont think thats what should determine the use  i just think
its better if were consistent here so i would have a preference for using the same language that
was used in the testimony
on the additional firming question that tom hoenig raised i have some sympathy with
him on this  as the bluebook said its difficult to know how the markets will react to this
change  its always tentative how the markets are going to react but the bluebook said that now
the judgment is more tentative than usual as to how theyll react to this change in the statement
i think it will reinforce the markets anticipation of future policy ease and probably increase
expectations of ease  but having said that i think the new version does more accurately reflect
our views and the views around this table  so its a close call but on balance i think we ought to
make the change and i would support the language in section 4 as written
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  i think the likely effect of taking the firming language out this afternoon
will be as mike moskow suggests  but the more important point is how it conditions the market
over the period to the next meeting  there i think its going to be driven by the flow of incoming
data and i think thats the more important point
mr moskow  well well see  laughter
mr mishkin  good answer  i think its tentativethe judgment is tentative
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thats totally immaterial to whether this is going to affect what the rate
is at the next meeting  i mean lots of changes to rates could occur between now and the next
meeting or the effect of this statement on rates after this meeting could persist until the next
meeting  so i dont see how its relevant bill
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  well like so many others i agree with keeping the funds rate at the
current level and the language in alternative b  were experiencing real growth at about the rate
we expected but inflation is no longer declining  having said that im comfortable with the
current policy and dont see a need to move until we become convinced that our forecast for
inflation moderation wont be realized  in regard to the language im not yet a master of the
nuances laughter and so i dont have strong opinions on predominant versus principal
because predominant is consistent with the past it does strike me as being slightly stronger
therefore ill go with the consensus but i would favor that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman yesterday i indicated concern for the downside even
though i come from a district that is running a pretty warm economy  my soundings with
business leaders and my interpretation of what i heard around the table yesterday lead me to
conclude that we are perhaps one revision or one shock including possibly a financial market
shock or a credit crunch shock away from a recession  im in favor of alternative b  im still
concerned about inflationary pressures  im impressed by tom hoenigs arguments on how
powerful ethanol and other forces are in our society but i think thats adequately reflected in the
last section  that is if things changed and we had stronger economic data and in my case
stronger verisimilitude if not similitude from the private sector then it leaves the space to
tighten because the last section is a balanced statement
i want to comment on what president moskow and president minehan pointed out about
the second section  thats the key point id like to dwell oni think its wise to make a full stop
after the word quarters  still favorable implies doubt and i dont think thats a wise thing
for us to imply  second we do repeat ourselves on housing  third we cant say with certainty
that there is a gradual waning of the correction in the housing market we dont know  so again
i would strongly recommend that you have a full stop after the word quarters  finally i will
play my role of a broken record to suggest once again that we insert the word global before
resource utilization so that we dont continue to further the belief that we are oriented toward a
closed economy  those would be my recommendations mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  im okay leaving the fed funds rate unchanged
today  i say that despite the fact that inflation readings have been less favorable lately  core
inflation is clearly higher than we want  i see little reason to expect moderation anytime soon
without action on our part  if the truth about the forecast is that as the greenbook says we expect
moderation at the rate of 1 basis point a month or less it would take a statistician quite a while to
discern statistically between that and no moderation at all  concerns about growth continue to keep
us on the sidelines and recent jitters about subprime mortgages and business investments have
added to ongoing concern since the last meeting  these concerns have given me the jitters as well
both because i would prefer stronger growth to less and because at times in the past such concerns
have deterred needed action on inflation  so to repeat im okay leaving the fed funds rate
unchanged  as i said i do believe we will need to tighten this year to reduce inflation but this
doesnt seem like a propitious time to do so
with regard to the statement i very much agree with president hoenig  im not sure i
understand what the language in section 4 is supposed to convey  on the one hand it seems to
retain and even strengthen our antiinflation tilt by labeling inflation our principal policy concern
on the other hand the move to symmetric language in the second sentence would seem to remove a
tightening bias  thus these sentences seem to work in opposite directions  so more broadly i agree
with president hoenig  we should not be loosening the sense of our tightening bias in this
statement  i also agree with president plosser  ill just register agreement with his concern about
the capacity utilization language  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i also generally share the views of alternative b
and favor maintaining the federal funds rate today  i thought what id do is just highlight a couple
of things  first i think the statement needs to be reflective of the real economy rather than financial
markets as we discussed yesterday  so let me spend a moment on the reference to stillfavorable
financial conditions in alternative b  i think the financial conditions are still favorable and so
thats an honest depiction of events as is the rest of the statement after the reference to coming
quarters  i think the question really is if we enter the debate over describing the financial
conditions how do we get out of it  so when we meet next im wondering how well then
describe the financial conditions  or if we stop any reference thereto what is that saying  that is i
think these markets are adjusting in a very orderly way  i dont feel now as i feared a few weeks
ago that we would have to say and do things to ensure that adjustment occurs  if we dont refer to
these financial conditions and we continue to suggest that we think the economy will expand at a
moderate pace over the coming quarters that in itself shows that we have some degree of comfort
that the financial market tumult hasnt really changed our central tendency  so though im
comfortable with the honest depiction of all of alternative b i worry a bit about what our exit
strategy is  i cant come up with a better way in which to refer to financial conditions without
inviting that discussion and so im left with puzzlement about an exit strategy on that question
the most important thing that were accomplishing in alternative b is suggesting that we arent
going to come to the rescue of market tumult that market discipline is working that we dont want
complacency in the markets and that our job is not to make sure that people make money in those
markets  our job as many of you have said is to keep the economy on an even keel  so with that
i favor alternative b but i will remain a little uncomfortable until someone can tell how we answer
the question about what we do next regarding the reference to stillfavorable financial conditions
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i too favor alternative bkeeping the federal
funds rate constant at this point  from the discussion yesterday i gather that many of us still see in
some cases a substantial risk that inflation just wont come down from where it is  also from the
discussion yesterday i think that there is a bit more uncertaintysome fatter tailsand so
modifications to the statement that reflect that uncertainty are useful
let me work from the bottom up and go from the risk assessment in section 4  i like the risk
assessment  the removal of the explicit reference to firming will certainly be interpreted by the
markets as opening the possibility of a cut down the line which we hadnt explicitly opened up
before  we do offset that a biti think jeff lacker was getting at this although i think it is actually
somewhat positive rather than negativeby characterizing the committees inflation concern as
principal  a slight softening from predominant makes sense to me because data have come in
since the chairman enunciated that p word the predominant word  laughter  principal is
appropriately reflective of the new information and the way people have talked about it and gives us
a bit more flexibility down the line because the tails are somewhat fatter which reflects the
discussion  also i take vinces presentation about 200001 to heart and so getting a little more
flexibility there may not be a bad idea at this time
on section 3 its important to acknowledge that the readings have been a little above what
most people are comfortable with and so i think it makes sense to go with that language  in section
2 some things i like very much and some things i dont like  the phrases that the recent indicators
have been more mixed and that the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing are good ways to
characterize the discussion we had yesterday and accurate reflections of whats going on in the
economy  i like the phrase the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing and i certainly agree
that the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters
although in principle i would favor having a shorter section 2 just cutting it off there we might
want to have at least a little something else  so i would say supported by among other things
gains in income and leave the wording there  im actually quite strongly opposed to including
stillfavorable financial conditions for some of the reasons that have been enunciated  that
phrase will look like our very weak attempt to say that we really really do believe that the markets
are okaythat is a weak attempt to talk up the markets  when we use that phrase were thinking
about just the low bidask spreads and the capital thats flowing into the markets  theres a very
real chance that the phrase will be misinterpreted as focusing on the equity markets which i dont
think any of us intends it to mean  also governor warshs concern is an important one  how do
we get out of talking about the market  what if the market goes down  i dont think its good for
us to be using language that we cant explain our way out of  in a speech or in testimony we could
explain what we mean by stillfavorable financial market conditions  but with the kind of
crimped kabuki language that we have in our statement i think it would be much better to omit
the reference  given that we have a very good phrase about the ongoing adjustment in the housing
sector in the first sentence im not sure what we accomplish by taking away from it or giving more
color to what is a waning correction  being neutral because of uncertainty about that marketthat
its adjustment is just ongoingis most appropriate  so i would favor either cutting things off after
coming quarters or putting in something like supported by among other things gains in
income  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  do we have any precedent vince for reference to
financial conditions described as favorable or otherwise  weve said that its supported by
accommodative policy
mr reinhart  i was going to say that mostly the references would be to the stance of
policy as opposed to financial conditions
mr kohn  i think there was back in 2001 after we cut rates but im not sure  overall
my concern about cutting things off after quarters or gains in income is that such a statement
would be kind of weak  we say that indicators have been mixed and adjustment in the housing
sector is ongoing but theres an act of faith here  somehow not giving some rationale for the
moderate growth in income ahead weakens the statement  the income phrase always struck me as
endogenous  we think that growth is going to be moderate and that income will go up with
growth  but i can see the worries about the mention of financial conditions  most people around
the table mentioned that concern
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan   you could do something like still taken all together the economy
seems likely to expand at a moderate pace  i think that governor kroszner was right on  in terms
of the shortness of this language highlighting these three things really does run the risk that they
will appear to be things on which we are going to focus a lot of attention  we dont want to convey
particularly in the message on financial conditions that thats where were going to put our
attention
chairman bernanke  let me just ask a question  the intention of this was not to
comment on recent market volatility  the intention was to say that interest rates are low stock
prices are pretty strong and liquidity is good and that is going to support growth  would changing
it to say aided by supportive financial conditions or something like that be of any help
ms minehan  i fully agree with governor kroszners idea that thinking that in this short
form we can explain all of that is risky  given the volatility that we have recently seen and the
concern which many have expressed that this committee is out to save people from stock market
problems i just think that we run a risk by highlighting financial conditions in our statement right
now
mr fisher  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  i feel very strongly about this issue  id like to underscore the arguments
that have been madei think we have unanimity around this table  our job is to get the real
economy right  were opening a door here that entails significant risk  governor warsh made a
very good comment  what is our exit strategy once we open that door  so the question is whether
opening that door is necessary  i dont believe its necessary at this juncture
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  the way i would look at the issue is to suppose that we have another break in
the stock market of 5 percent or 8 percent something like that  if we put financial conditions
now we clearly couldnt put it in the next time if we had that condition  then what would it mean
for us to take it out  thats why among the other things that people have said i would prefer not to
have it in
chairman bernanke  okay  i get a general sense of agreement around the table
unless someone wants to speak strongly in favor of financial conditions  president stern
mr stern  no i dont want to speak strongly in favor of retaining the reference to
financial conditions  but i do think along the lines that governor kohn expressed that we need to
provide some basis for our expecting moderate growth to continue  otherwise that sentence does
come across as an act of faith and doesnt seem to me to be particularly compelling  i dont see that
mentioning financial conditions does us any damage and its actually valuable in providing some
rational for that judgmentand that is the judgment
chairman bernanke  that was our objective and were trying to find short ways to
say it  anyone else  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i dont have any problem  i agree with cathy on the length
at the same time i dont think focusing on financial conditions is a particular problem because
what youve said about having that in there can be said about anything else that you put in  what
happens next time if income is lower and so forth  so i dont think that financial conditions in
and of itself matters one way or the other  i also agree with governor kohn that we do need to have
a rationale  we cant just take it on faith  we went down this road some time ago and this is what
we have now so i think we do owe people some explanation cathy
ms minehan  this whole statement is on faith though  laughter  it relies on
economic models and forecasts and a ton more detail than we can ever express  we say that recent
indicators are mixed  we say that the housing adjustment is ongoing  but if we take it all together
we still think the economy is likely to expand  aside from writing a treatise here i dont know
what more we can say that we could all feel comfortable with and not have to reconsider
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  i agree with that  if you look at what we said last time the only reference
to any specifics was to housing  if we stop the statement after the word quarters thats exactly
what well have this time  now i would make a minor suggestion  the word still could be
changed back to overall and just continue what we had last time  overall the economy seems
likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  that wording encompasses
that weve looked at all of the information and thats our assessment
chairman bernanke  the difference is that the first sentence last time was a positive
sentence  the first sentence this time is a negative sentence
mr moskow  thats why i think the word overall would help
chairman bernanke  overall however  laughter
mr moskow  i thought about however but preferred not to use that language
chairman bernanke  all right  any other twohanded interventions  governor
mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  to get perspective on this again i go back to
where i think we were in december  were really not that much different in our forecast from
december except that we have a little more uncertainty  that means that for the assessment of risk
i lean toward keeping the same language from the last meeting and from the december meeting
particularly because of the issue that president hoenig mentionedthat we need to indicate that we
are still very vigilant on inflation and that were worried about it  a further issue is that i think the
change will be seen as removing some of the bias which will have a big impact on the markets
thats where i was before the meeting  however vince has been very convincing  maybe its his
wonderful vests  laughter  you might notice vince that i tried to liven it up by wearing a
doublebreasted suit  so we have a little action going on here different from the usual  laughter
its really the ghost of 2000 that worries me  the argument that we could be in a situation in
which we get a shock and need to have the flexibility to deal with it is actually very important  in
that case i have concerns along the lines of president hoenigs but im willing to live with the new
language in alternative b for the reason that you mentioned  because i think predominant has a
little stronger connotationnot because of the dictionary but because it was used in the testimony
i would stay with predominant  it is just sort of an offset and i would keep it on that level  in
terms of the big debate about what we do regarding the rationale i think it is a tough call  i do not
like mentioning financial markets as governor warsh said  then crafting the language is very
difficult  so i guess i end up with the kiss principle which is keep it simple stupid and i would
put a full stop after quarters  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  im very comfortable with
the center of gravity in this discussion  the boundaries have shifted just a bit and we face a little
more uncertainty on the growth front  but i think theres still asymmetry in the balance of risks that
we face and we need to continue to highlight the risk that inflation may not moderate enough  the
probability that we will tighten further has significantly diminished but i think our expectations
about what makes sense for policy are still above the markets expectations  i dont think that
situation means that we need to try to push the markets expectations up to ours  by adjusting the
statement slightly in the direction of neutral we face the risk that we all acknowledge that the
market will price in more easing than they already have  but it is better to live with that risk than to
preserve a formulation that implies a probability of further tightening that i dont think is justified
we need to give ourselves the flexibility now to move to neutral sooner than might have seemed
likely  therefore the broad outlines of alternative b make sense to me
on section 2 as don said the reason for putting more texture about the basis for our
forecast going forward was in part to counteract the fact that were suddenly darker about the near
term outlook  the absence of any texture on our forecast makes the statement darker and conveys
more concern  so although i like minimalism and although a lot of sensible things have been said
about the specific references to financial conditions and housing i think theres some value in
having more texture about the basis for our view  im not as troubled about the reference to
financial conditions as many of you are  we could modify the rationale to say supported by
income gains overall financial conditions and the gradual waning so that the characterization of
financial conditions is implicit rather than explicitly favorable  but i dont think that doing so
would go far in meeting the concerns expressed around the table  so i would be fine with the
moskow formulation stopping after quarters  i think the rest of the wording has it right
on predominant versus principal let me give just the following argument  i dont
believe that a plain language reading of the two words justifies the conclusion that principal will
be read as softer than predominant  people disagree and in answering the question about what
we expect to achieve by changing predominant to principal im not sure wed win the basic
argument that people would say yeah its softer  so on the argument of consistency i would
stay with predominant  i dont think our views of the risks on the inflation front have shifted
significantly since the testimony and so i dont have any problem with maintaining that  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  if i could id like to clarify slightly my earlier comments in the sense that
im not of the view that the language should stay in terms of a bias toward tightening because i
think we need to tighten  my view has been that we are modestly firm and that we should be
conveying to the market that we are going to stay modestly firm until we see a consistent decline in
the inflation numbers that we have  the difficulty is trying to explain that in language  so what we
end up with is a kind of hobsons choice  we leave the language as it has been therefore signaling
that we will stay firm or we change the language to say that we will be dependent on the future
datawhich is i think also accurate  but making the change tends to confirm the view that now
we are more likely to ease than we really are  either way we are giving signals to the market that
are not exactly what we want to explain  so which of those do we choose in order to keep
expectations from changing too dramatically  thats really my point as ive thought about this
which i wanted to clarify  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  as i said in my discussion obviously im very concerned about a
reference to financial conditions especially stillfavorable financial conditions  but as i also said
i think that it hangs out there a bit naked without some color around it  i would be fine with keeping
personal income gains and the gradually waning correction to the housing market  my preference
would be just something like income gains among other factors to put something there  but that
may be so weak that it may be better to cut off  im sympathetic to having some color but i think
the wrong color is the financial market condition
chairman bernanke  governor kohn has suggested supported by gains in income
and the anticipated gradual waning in the correction of the housing market
mr kroszner  that would be excellent
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  that wording has the virtue of being true in that it is the
basis for the central forecast
chairman bernanke  an additional advantage  laughter
vice chairman geithner  it is what we think  the problem with it is that as don
said the reference to gains in income itself is empty and putting so much emphasis on housing as
part of our forecast for growth being basically fine going forward is a little awkward  my view is
the corner solutions are more attractive than the intermediate and they are either some modified
version of what we have now or a return to minimalism with a stop after quarters
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  yes  im really sympathetic to randys view about financial conditions
im sympathetic about financial conditions because i think theres real potential for confusion in
markets about how the phrase relates to policy and whether we might ease if things got too chaotic
or volatile  but i agree with president stern that a little more texture on what were doing is fine  i
share governor kohns view that appealing to endogenous variables as if theyre an exogenous
cause for belief in support is a little confusing but in the context i think the reference would be
taken to signal that we expect consumption growth to support the expansion  i just wanted to
register that
chairman bernanke  thank you  has everyone spoken  well  laughter  let me
try to find a consensus here  first i agree with the sentiment around the table  i recommend no
action today  we should continue to emphasize inflation riski think theres a strong feeling that it
remains the greater risk  there is acknowledgement that uncertainty and risk have increased on
both sides of the dual mandate but the balance of risks does not seem to have changed very much
supporting the idea of keeping the rate where it is is that as best we can tell the level of the rate
currently seems about right to foster our objectives  also as people have noted by standing pat we
have considerable ability to tighten de facto as market expectations move toward our actual revealed
behavior  so i would counsel patience on the rate and maintain the rate at its current level today
let me take a stab at the statement  i think we all agree on section 1  laughter  on
section 3 let me note the suggestion of i think it was president stern  im sympathetic  i didnt
hear much support however and again its a change  so i would recommend that we stay with the
current section 3
on section 4 first a small point  i think the mild preference was for predominant over
principal as consistent with my testimony  to the extent that were trying to lean against easing
of expectations if predominant is slightly stronger it would be beneficial in that respect  so let
me propose that change  i recognize the risk that the second sentence in section 4 has the potential
to mislead the market a bit  my concern is that the second sentence that we have been using is
simply not literally true anymore  the implication is that we are certain that the next move is going
to be an increase and its only a matter of when and how much  we have been trying for some time
to get out of that language and to get to something that is more descriptive  the benefits of the
second sentence are first that it does create more flexibility and second that it refers only to things
on the righthand side of the taylor rulethat is inflation and outputand doesnt make a
statement about future policy actions which most people seem to prefer avoiding whenever
possible  again although it will be viewed as a small step toward balance or flexibility we are
fairly strong in our statement of inflation risk  in particular weve introduced here not just that we
think there are inflation risks but that our specific concern is that inflation will not moderate which
is a different and somewhat stronger statement than we have had  i acknowledge that there may be
some market rally based on this but with president poole i think that the data will dominate as we
go forward  indeed the endogeneity of interest rates and their stabilizing effects are very important
assets that we have in policy
with respect to the description in section 2 the intention was given that the first sentence is
relatively negative to give some modest rationale for our thinking that the economy seems likely to
continue expanding  let me try one more suggestion  perhaps we can find a solution  one reason
that a quick summary is difficult is that the story for recovery is in fact fairly complicated  it
involves certainly the ending of the housing correction but also assumptions of inventory correction
of investment coming back at a moderate pace and of a number of other things  the notion here
was to look at more fundamental factors that would be underlying the assumption of growth such
as income which has grown rapidly and supportive financial conditions  but i hear the concerns
the greenbook forecast calls for moderate growth in essentially all of the components except for
housing  in particular it expects consumption to grow more than 2 percent investment more than
2 percent support from government spending and net exports and so on  so something along the
lines of supported by growth in nonhousing components of final demand might be a descriptive
way of saying that we think that although housing will be a drag the other components of the
economy will support moderate growth  thats a suggestion
mr mishkin  could you repeat the sentence
chairman bernanke  the last phrase would be supported by growth in nonhousing
components of final demand
mr mishkin  two hands
chairman bernanke  yes governor mishkin
mr mishkin  im a little worried about that because theres been such a big deal made
about the housing market and the media have been making a big deal that its going to collapse  we
mention in the first sentence that it has gotten weaker and if theres no counter to that which is part
of the view that we think theres some stabilization of demand i would worry  so i worry a little
that by saying nonhousing we dont have enough of a counter to the first sentence  when i first
read this one reaction i had was to follow the kiss principle but that worried me a bit because we
changed from the previous statement in which we said we had a problem in housing  then it was
all right because then we came back and said yes but we think its going to work out okay in the
end  so theres a little tension here that worries me about saying nonhousing which may spook
the markets a bit
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  i would also point out that people may read economy as being gdp  if
you take housing out the rest of it is gdp  the way you stated it is a bit of a tautology  i think the
simplest thing is just to change still to nevertheless  nevertheless the economy seems likely
to continue to expand at a moderate pace and just leave it at that
chairman bernanke  okay  i think thats where were heading  vince
mr reinhart  first id like to thank everyone for validating my own career decision
laughter  second in your description you use the word fundamentals which might be a
substitute for financial conditions  you could say supported by stillfavorable fundamentals
including gains in income and the waning of the correction in the housing market
chairman bernanke  that is similar to what governor kohn suggested  i got the
sense at the time that it wasnt well received  all right i think were not going to come to a
conclusion  so i think we need to accept president minehans suggestion  was there other
comment  starting with nevertheless might be better  nevertheless the economy seems likely
to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  okay  president plosser
mr plosser  just a moment  i think im fine with that  i like your suggestion for
changing it that way  this speaks volumes about our next topic of discussion of communications
and how we convey more about what we think rather than being confined to the structure of this
statement  id also like to pick up on another comment that you made  i spoke before president
stern but i think that president sterns suggestion to replace sentence 2 in section 3 with sentence 2
in section 3 of alternative c would be a big improvement  since you alluded to that suggestion and
said that nobody came to support it i just want to add my support to that suggestion
chairman bernanke  are there others who would like to make that change
several  i support that
others  no i  laughter
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  considerable uncertainty has surrounded our forecast of
inflation for some time  thats how we refer to the fact that there are inflation risks  we have now
changed the characterization of the statement to acknowledge the fact that the recent readings have
been somewhat elevated  that implicitly acknowledges that theres some uncertainty to our
forecast  i dont think its a justifiable change  i dont think there is substantial increase in our
uncertainty about the inflation forecast today versus january or even december
chairman bernanke  let me ask your indulgence on leaving it the way it is this
time and thinking about it more carefully for the next meeting  are there any other comments
should i read it  laughter
ms danker  ill take a stab at it
chairman bernanke  youll take a stab  all right
ms danker  okay  let me start with the directive on page 28 of the bluebook
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with
maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5 percent
now the amended assessment of risk
in these circumstances the committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that
inflation will fail to moderate as expected  future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution
of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information
chairman bernanke                             yes
vice chairman geithner                      yes
president hoenig                                 yes
governor kohn                                   yes
governor kroszner                              yes
president minehan                               yes
governor mishkin                               yes
president moskow                               yes
president poole                                    yes
governor warsh                                  yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  michelle could you work with debbie to get a
printed version of the statement that well circulate after the break so everybody can at least
familiarize themselves with what were saying here today  laughter  all right  why dont we
take a coffee break for fifteen minutes  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we recommence  governor kohn
mr kohn  im reading the statement  laughter  but it didnt take long  laughter
i think carol has redistributed the list of questions that came from the memo that vincent sent
around4  there have been slight rewrites of questions 5 and 7 but the idea is basically the same

4  the list of questions to which mr kohn refers is appended to this transcript appendix 4
i want to start by thanking the staff for all the background memos  i thought they were
particularly clear and helpful  we are not going to have staff briefings this morning in part
because they did such a good job on the memos that i didnt think we really needed to follow up
with briefings this morning  but thank you all very much
we have two items on the agendathe numerical specification of price stability and the
trial run on the forecast and the forecast narrative  on the price stability objective you have the
questions in front of you  once we finish the discussion the subcommittee will compile the
results try to ascertain where we are and what the center of gravity would be and consider what
the next steps might be depending on what people say  on the trial run i dont anticipate an
extended discussion  if people have major issues and questions to raise they should raise them
but much of the idea of the trial run is to uncover major issues and questions so i hope that the
discussion can be relatively short  thats all i have to say by way of introduction mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  id like to make a couple of prefatory remarks
some of the issues here are political in nature so id like you to know that i have consulted a bit
with the congress  i did not go to negotiate i went to inform and therefore i dont have any
commitments to bring to you  but i was generally pretty encouraged by my discussions  i had
the sense thatand this is a very important caveatso long as our commitment to the dual
mandate remains strong both in word and in deed we will get a fair hearing if we decide to go
forward  i also have a very strong impression that the risk of going into directions that we dont
want in terms of opening up the federal reserve act and so on is quite low and can be managed
so we should think about this today on its merits  if we decide to go forward well have to
develop a strategy but i dont think that there are immediate barriers from the political side to
prevent us from considering this
that being said i just want to say also that we have not decided that we are going to
agree on an objective  there are various possibilities  we could agree on an objective  we
could agree to agree but to do it in a staged and gradual way  or we could simply not agree on
an objective  even so i think that the discussion today would be quite helpful for our internal
discussions because im not the only one who feels that a certain amount of disagreement exists
around the table that may be associated with views on what inflation should be and how we
should measure it  again we have not made any decisions and i hope today will give us some
more insight about how much consensus we have
just a word on the projections  as was noted i think that a minutesstyle process could
be a useful way to make sure that everybody has seen the document  but i want just to make
clear that if we do these projections twice a year the projections the commentary and so forth
will have to appear in the monetary policy report to the president which is about two weeks
after the meeting  therefore we will have to work toward ensuring that we can do this in about
a twoweek period or a little less than the usual period for the minutes  i just want to make that
clear
finally i think were in pretty good shape on time but were responding to several
requests  we are going to try very very hard to be finished by 300 pm so i hope everyone
will keep that in mind as we go through the discussion  the discussion is open for comments on
the questions that the committee raised  president poole
mr poole  well let me just go bing bing bing bing  i think it probably makes
sense mr chairman to take up these two topics separately so let me start on the price objective
my answer to question 1 is yes  i think the objective should be defined numerically  i believe
that the core pce is the right index  many of us have talked about that and we sort of coalesced
around that measure  i would like to see the goal stated as 1 percent plus or minus   to me
it makes sense to have a central point there but you have to have a range  i would like the goal
to be stated as in the medium term  ordinarily that might mean something like two years but
under certain circumstances it has to be longer because if you had a september 11 type of event
you would want to make sure that you were not driving the economy in the wrong direction by
going after the inflation goal in too rigid a fashion  i think there should be a consensus view of
the committeequestion 5  in answer to question 7 i think it would be extremely awkward if
we had separate views made public  the question would be why does poole differ from
bernanke  or if bernanke didnt answer what is bernankes view  i think wed just get
ourselves into a peck of trouble if we tried to do this freestyle  if were going to do this i think
we really need to have a committee decision  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman ive given this a lot of thought  if you remember in
the last round i asked for a compelling argument for adopting a stated specific inflation target  i
noted that it was not at all obvious that the countries that have adopted a specific inflation target
have done better than we have in terms of economic performance over the past decade or for
that matter better than countries that have not adopted a target  one could make the
counterargument that its not at all obvious that countries that have adopted numerical definitions
have done worse than we have  i understand and respect tremendously the theoretical arguments
that can be made to validate adoption of a numerical inflation objective  however to my mind
our vulnerability is not with economists or even with what we used to call the quant jocks on
wall street  our vulnerability is with those to whom we are accountablethe people and the
representatives of the people  also im not convinced that a numerical target is necessary at this
stage
i do note that others have done this  i raised four children  one of my first instructions
to my children was just because everybody else is doing it doesnt mean you have to do it
im mindful of that today  laughter  im mindful of the fact that other countries have adopted
this for different reasons  we know about the uks great moderation  i understand the use
of a numerical target in terms of the ecb given the complexity of many countries nonuniform
data and a population base that keeps changing  i understand that the bank of japan had been so
totally discredited that it was necessary to adopt such a target  i understand that the new
zealand government was so grossly incompetent that they had no choice but to adopt a target  i
consider other countries a bit too small to be persuasive  we talked about one of them last time
so my real issue is that i cant find a compelling case for or against but im not of the nature that
i like to join the crowd for the sake of joining the crowd
i dont think it is a sufficient reasonand i can say this because i am the least
academically prepared at this tableto do so at this time for the purity of what are very
respectable theoretical arguments  im mindful of the politics  you and i have talked about this
personally mr chairman  i am grateful for the comments that you made at the beginning of this
discussion  let me just state parenthetically that barney frank is one of the smartest men i
know  he would actually understand that the word stochastic derives from the greek
stochasticus which means skillful in aiming and he probably knows more than any other
congressman about this subject even though he has drawn what appears to be a line in the sand
but thats not what im worried about  i am worried about whether or not weve accumulated
sufficient political capital to sell this to the rest of the congress and to the representatives of the
people and im a little concerned about the timing of our doing so  we spent the past two days
talking about downside risk to the economy  some of us feel as i stated in our earlier
discussion that we may be just a revision away or perhaps a shock away from some economic
turbulence some economic weakness and perhaps a recession  i wonder about the optics mr
chairman of our dwelling on this subject at this time given that there doesnt seem to be a
compelling need because we dont have the same conditions that the united kingdom the ecb
the bank of japan new zealand and others faced
having said thatand im going to just shoot everything at once and then ill be donei
think it is implicit in question number 1 that we are going to adopt this which i am not in favor
of  but if i had a gun put to my head and someone said you must adopt this  what is your
preferred index i would say being someone who has an mba and not a phd that first it
is important that we adopt whatever target we adopt such that businessmen businesswomen
financiers and other economic agents do not need to take inflation into consideration in their
decisionmaking  second it must be politically palatable and credible and easy to understand
ordinarily i would argue if it werent for those two conditions for what we love in dallas
which is the trimmed mean but that is way too complicated to explain to the public  but i would
also argue against the pce excluding energy and food  i would argue for adopting the cpi  i
would argue for a 1 percent target over a threeyear to fiveyear period  over time they all
converge at any rate  by the way as far as im concerned if my math is still correct 1 percent
means that prices double every 72 years which is a reasonable lifetime and given the
 percentage point measurement bias that might actually mean they double every 140 years
which is about as much as i would like to see  so i would argue for a 1 percent target based on
the cpiif you put a gun to my head which i hope you dontover a longer time frame
as far as committee participants arriving at a consensus view on this goal i dont think
consensus is essential  in fact you could have the committee report a central tendency or some
range  im not going to get into questions 5 6 and 7  i want to go to the forecast narrative
which concerns me  as weve talked about before im not in favor of full frontal views  i took
note of governor kroszners comment about kabuki earlier i think its good to preserve a
little kabuki  if we are going to communicate with the public we need to communicate in
understandable language  i dont wish to give offense but i know i willi would not be in
favor of the staff drafting that statement  i would be in favor of writing it in the simplest possible
language  i suggest mr chairman that it would be more appropriate for say our
communications staff or michelle or somebody like that to draft this statement so that we
communicate to the public in a way that is comprehensible  i was taken aback at even the use of
the word stochastic at the end  we know what that means  the people have no idea what
stochastic means  again i return to my root question  with whom are we trying to
communicate  we talk about the markets  the markets are whateconomists theoretical
economists econometricians ourselves people on wall street sophisticated operators of
financial markets businesswomen and businessmen or the public in general  my greatest fear is
doing anything that would impugn the integrity or threaten the preservation of this institution
and so i want to plead with you and with the rest of the people around this table  1 to consider
whether we really need to adopt an inflation target at this time and 2 should we do so to make
it as simple and comprehensible and easily communicated as possible and to do so in the same
way with the forecast that we are discussing the possibility of issuing  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  it wont surprise anyone that i believe the
committee should adopt a numerical objective for inflation for reasons that we have discussed at
great length over the past several meetingsnamely to clarify our internal deliberations to
clarify the publics understanding of our objectives and to enhance our accountability for
achieving those objectives  i just do not see how any useful purpose is served by retaining the
discretion to vary our objective from mediumterm and longerterm inflation trends
following vincents outline i believe our objective should be stated in terms of the
broadest available measure of the purchasing power of money  the best measure we have of the
true consumption value of the dollar is the price index for personal consumption expenditures  i
believe that the overall index would be preferable to the core as an objective  i know ive argued
in the past for focusing on core pce but on reconsideration ive changed my mind  the
various arguments for excluding food and energy are narrow theyre somewhat technical and
theyre difficult to explain to the publici should know ive tried  laughter  the arguments
are incomplete as well in the sense of the range of considerations that one has regarding choosing
the inflation rateonly some of them tell you to stabilize the core inflation rate  reducing
uncertainty about the rate of return on the purchasing power of money suggests a broader index
and one that is much easier for the public to understand  moreover i dont think arguments for
the core the way it is constructed now are likely to be robust to structural changes in the
economy shifts in what prices are sticky what prices are not what are market determined and
what not and stochastic properties of various components of inflation  granted the overall
index is more variable than the core right now but fluctuations in the overall index are more
transitory than the core as well  were naturally going to factor that variability into our
forecasts our actions and our communications  in explaining the transitory influences on the
overall index we can easily refer to the core if that makes sense as aiding our judgment about
where the overall index is going to go  the fact that various payment programs like social
security are indexed to the cpi is in my mind of no consequence for this choice  if we target
the pce price index it will naturally rise in prominence over time  no matter which index we
use to stabilize people with income indexed to the cpi are going to be exposed to the risk
associated with the measurement error in the cpi  it doesnt matter what we target they still
bear that risk
although i and others have discussed a range of comfort zones in the past im
uncomfortable with the ambiguity of presenting only a target range for inflation  when inflation
is above the target range for example the public would be unclear about whether we intend to
bring inflation back to the center of the zone or whether getting just inside the top of the range
would constitute success in our eyes  i think it makes most sense to specify our objective as a
single number but also to provide a range around the objective within which we would generally
expect inflation to remain and to provide a sense of how close to our objective we expect to be
on average that would help enhance our accountability
what number should we choose as an objective  our inflation mandate specifies price
stability  the biases in our measures of inflation imply that price stability corresponds to
something a bit below 1 percent for the overall pce right now  the main consideration usually
advanced for choosing a number appreciably above price stability is the notion of building in a
buffer to reduce the probability of encountering the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates
there seems to be substantial popular confusion about the zero bound and its implications for
monetary policy  but i agree with you mr chairman that we have all the tools necessary to
deal with this problem  now granted the effectiveness of some of those tools would depend
critically on communicating credibly to the public so the zero bound might present us with some
unique communication challenges should we encounter it  i can imagine giving such potential
challenges some small weight in choosing a target value but i emphasize small because as i
said i believe we would have all the tools we need at our disposal and we ought to be able to
communicate that fact
taking all of this on board i believe 1 percent would be our best choice for a numerical
inflation objective  i believe 1 percent would be tolerably close to price stability but i view
2 percent as incompatible with our price stability mandate  should we adopt an objective above
1 percent however we should not emphasize the zero bound because doing so would only
reinforce the publics sense of anxiety should the situation ever arise  i think we should provide
the guidance that we expect overall inflation to generally remain within plus or minus 1 percent
of our objective  we should view our choice of objective as close to permanentthis is
important  that is we should be extremely reluctant to alter our numerical target  we are
inviting people to make longrun plans on the basis of our commitment and they should be able
to count on us over the long haul
a corollary of viewing our choice as permanent is that we should not place any weight at
all on current initial conditions and the associated transition costs when choosing what to target
a universal property of monetary models and many other models as well is that initial
conditions have no bearing on the longrun inflation rate under optimal policy  it doesnt matter
where you start you get to the same optimal inflation rate in the end  furthermore choosing a
target closer than otherwise to where we are now in an effort to avoid transition costs would
delay and dilute the contribution to our credibilitydelay because eventually the inflation rate
will change and we will need to take action to return inflation to target and dilute because
choosing a target to match current inflation will encourage the public to believe that if inflation
drifts away we might change the target again to avoid shortrun transition costs  after all a fear
of transition costs is exactly what discouraged us from taking sufficient action to stem inflation
before 1979  moreover the staff memo by reifschneider and tetlow shows how the transition
costs can be minimal if we successfully communicate our intentions
question 4 is whats the time horizon by which the goal should typically be achieved
that is how long would we expect it to take to get to the target at any point in time and from any
state of the world  well this may vary  i believe that most of the time we should be able to
conduct policy so that inflation is expected to return to the objective within two years assuming
that the public understands how we are conducting policy  an important consideration here is
that the credibility of an objective will depend on the publics ability to assess our adherence to
it  the longer the time that we allow for expected returns to target the more often shocks will
interfere and the publics inference problem will be that much harder
question 5 has been reworded  should the committee participants jointly decide on its
goal either through a formal vote or an informal consensus  you know if that means striving
for broad agreement yes  if that means an individual participant should be able to veto an
agreement my answer is no especially if its president geithner  laughter  question 7 is
should participants views be made public in the minutes  i guess this question has been
reworded too  how should the public be informed  if im reading this correctly it refers to
how the various views of participants that are expressed during deliberations on establishing a
numerical objective be revealed or not  i see no reason that dissenting views should not be
faithfully reflected in the minutes  but im assuming that once a decision is made participants
are going to accept the agreedupon goal as the committees objective and the basis for
policymaking
regarding the trial run i support doing one in may  i only have a couple of minor
comments  the first is that i would take the instruction to base projections on an appropriate
path of monetary policy to mean an appropriate reaction function because i think conditioning
on a fixed timeinvariant path for the policy rate doesnt make much sense and makes it harder
to explain what the fan charts are all about  i would also note that the way in which the
simulations underlying the confidence intervals in the fan charts are presented at least as i
interpret them did not appear to capture parameter uncertainty  perhaps other sources of
uncertainty as well are omitted  we should strive to construct those so that they do convey all
the sources of uncertainty that were capable of incorporating so they should be comprehensive
in that regard  that concludes my remarks  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  first of all i really want to congratulate the staff on the documents they
produced  when i was thinking about how they might be written i would have had a hard time
figuring out how to make sense out of all of this  it was really extremely well done and so you
really deserve congratulations on this  one thing i find by the way in talking to staff members
is their incredible professionalism  when you ask them to do something thats really hard to do
but important they love doing it  that professionalism showed in this case
let me go down the list of questions  obviously i dont think my answer to number 1
will be a huge surprise  laughter  some interesting discussion would be created if it were
different but clearly i believe that having a numerical price objective is important  the reasons
are the ones ive discussed before  very briefly i think it clarifies communication with the
public the markets and the politicians  it increases transparency and accountability which i
think is a key issue for central banks  also a numerical objective would actually improve the
clarity and has improved the clarity of discussions about monetary policy inside central banks
i think it would help in this context in the fomc as well  the reason i think it would is that it
would lead more naturally to discussions about policy in terms of appropriate inflation paths
that is the way that modern monetary policy analysis indicates is appropriate for us to think
about how we do our policy  it actually is an element now of the way we discuss policy but i
think a numerical price objective would make the discussion even clearer  if we were having
such discussions inside at some point the numerical objective would have to go outside  theres
an issue about transparency here  if were going to clarify how we make policy inside and were
not telling the public how were doing it at some point it will leak out  then we look foolish or
as though we have not been transparent which i think is also a problem
so there always are issues  the devil is in the details and thats really what the questions
are dealing with  i like to think about the principles by which i deal with the rest of the
questions  a numerical inflation objective has to have three important features  first the
objective needs to be absolutely and clearly consistent with the dual mandate  thats also very
important politically but i strongly believe in the dual mandate and so we have to make sure
that thats the case  financial stability concerns though you might consider them somewhat
separate are part of the dual mandate and as such are clearly key to how we do this  second
the objective has to be easy to communicate clearly to the public which is something that
president fisher pointed out  third the objective needs to be evolutionary because we want to
build on our successes and because it would be politically more palatable  all three of these
features by the way are actually very important in terms of the political process in terms of
talking to the public about how we are conducting policy and in terms of helping them have
confidence in it
regarding the questions i want to start with question 4 because i think that question
the issue of the appropriate time horizonis critical to thinking about all the other questions
the first part of the question is to ask what kind of things might affect the time horizon  the
reality is that the time horizon can have a lot of variability  the science of monetary policy or
the economics that we have learned over the years in terms of the best way to do monetary
policy says that in fact your horizon is going to change depending on how far away from your
ultimate goal you are currently what kind of shocks youve had whether the shocks are
temporary or permanent how big the output gaps that you project are and then clearly what the
financial stability issues are  if you get shocks to the financial markets you have to worry about
them  so my thinking is that the minimum time horizon is going to be two years because thats
effectively the policy period  but the horizon could be substantially longer than that and i think
this is extremely important in the design because it has a big impact on the issue of the dual
mandate  i think its absolutely critical that we make it clear that the horizon would sometimes
have to be quite long  in fact from a political viewpoint doing so is extremely important
because by indicating that the horizon could be sometimes quite long we are actually indicating
that we care about output fluctuations which is a key element of the dual mandate  politically it
is also important because it makes it clear that we would be unwilling to beat the economy over
the head with a baseball bat in order to get inflation down quickly  again that indicates that we
do care about output fluctuations  so i lean toward not being too precise about the horizon but
instead indicating that the objectives to be achieved in the long run are sort of on average over
the business cycle  the chairman used language like this in a speech in st louis in 2003 and i
was very comfortable with that language
let me deal with the other issues some of which i dont have strong views on but i can
give you the different sides  on the issue of the price index i really dont have strong views
its really six of one and half a dozen of the other  i lean slightly toward the cpi because it is
more readily understood by the public  its what is reported every month  it might even have an
advantage in that it is never revised  the rs document actually changed my view on this
because i think you are quite right that from a policy viewpoint it doesnt really matter  but
there is the issue that when a revision occurs and is for example upward it may look as though
you didnt do a good job when in fact with the information you had you did the best job
possible  so the lack of revision has a bit of political advantage although not an advantage from
the view of actually doing policy  i think youre quite right in that regard  what is the
advantage of the pce index  it has the advantage of continuity so it fits the evolutionary
element that i talked about  it also has slight advantages on a technical basis however theyre
not as big as they used to be  when the fed went to the pce instead of the cpi in talking about
the inflation numbers at which it was looking doing so then was more necessary than it would be
now  the bottom line here is that im willing to go with whatever other people are willing to go
with on this but i have a slight preference for the cpi
what about headline versus core  i have problems with a core measure from the
following viewpoint  there is really no one right measure of the core and theory can change in
telling us what it should be  also regarding the issue of whether the core has the more
permanent trend elements let me give a case as an example in which that might be shifting
usually we think of food prices as very temporary because they have to do with drought
anchovies leaving the coast of brazil or something like that  but think about the case of ethanol
right now  theres a push for ethanol production  i have to tell you i think that is a very bad
piece of public policy  however it could have permanent effects  im sorry tom its going to
help your district
mr hoenig  no it wont  laughter
mr mishkin  i dont think its a good idea  it may have much more permanent
consequences for food prices  then should you necessarily exclude food from the core when in
fact its more of a permanent shock  in that case i think there are issues  another critical issue
relates to the horizon  if you think that the horizon should be long or not precisely defined then
the difference between core and headline becomes much less important because in the long run
the number that you should shoot for in the core will be the same as shooting for that number in
the headline  in this context it makes sense to use a headline measure not a core measure
however for policy discussions we will need to continue to refer to the core particularly in
regard to shocks such as the recent episode with energy  in fact other central banks have
successfully done so  i think the international finance document talks a lot about canada and
how theyve done it exactly this way
on question 3 point goal or range again the time horizon is critical  if you have a fixed
period for evaluation there is no question to me that a range makes a lot of sense  it nicely
shows that you care about uncertainty  i recently wrote an academic paper that shows that a
range has very nice properties in terms of the appropriate objective function that you get and the
behavior of a central bank because its clear that youd be shooting for the midpoint and then
theres some uncertainty around it  the problem is that if you take my view that the horizon
should be potentially long or not fixed then talking about a range creates confusion  a range
then looks like a zone of indifference  so if we took a number such as 1 to 2 as our comfort zone
or range would 19 be okay relative to 15  as the purpose of talking about a numerical
inflation objective is clarity i think that a range would be a mistake  it also could mean that
inflation expectations would be less grounded  when inflation goes up to 19 versus 15 people
might move up their inflation expectations up  again we would be losing one of the key
benefits of having a numerical inflation objective  one thing that was not in the if document
and they shouldnt have put it in because its a private communication but i canis the issue of
australia  australia is one of the countries that have a comfort zone range  they call it a thick
point and they talk about a number over the cycle  it hasnt been a disaster so it is not a huge
deal  but officials there said you know if we had started this process a little differently
they had to convince their governor who was not particularly enthusiastic initially about
inflation targeting and so used a thick pointit would have been better if we had just picked a
number  so i think they have some discomfort  my research is not scientificit comes from
sitting and having a beer with them in the pubbut i think their experience argues for a point
target
what about the issue of level  again this is very important  i have to point out that my
perspective reflects my views on the way the economy works and the way expectations work  i
strongly believe that just announcing an objective will not substantially change inflation
expectations  the chairman and i participated in writing a book on this topic  we looked at the
adoption of inflation targeting by many countries and the evidence was that it did not change
inflation expectations immediately  in fact expectations were anchored over time through
actions and through having inflation targeting which was a huge benefit  again the memo by
reifschneider and tetlow on optimalcontrol exercises was really terrifica beautiful memo  i
thought it was just really first rate  when i looked at it i was very comfortable with the
characterization of learning from policy actions  i do not accept the standard view in past
bluebooks that it takes ten years to get down there which is based on what happened to inflation
in the past and then gets incorporated into expectations  i think expectations can move faster
than that but the way you do it is by actions as well as by words  you have to bring out the
baseball bat a bit which indicates that there is some substantial cost to doing so  you saw that in
the simulations
my view is that there are substantial costs to moving inflation expectations down from
the current level of around 2 percent  also from reading the memo and from reading the
literature i dont see a big difference in terms of economic efficiency between a 2 percent
steadystate inflation rate and a 1 percent steadystate inflation rate  so i really do disagree
strongly with you president lacker on this issue  i think transition costs matter  they should
be part of our calculations  when i include the transition costs and my view that theres not a
huge difference from a welfare standpoint in terms of 1 versus 2 percent im comfortable with
2 percent
let me state one other advantage and then go to what worries me  there is an important
political issue here  to me whats really important is to anchor inflation expectations and ill
do anything to get there  the actual number is less important so long as it is a reasonable
number consistent with the greenspan definition of price stabilitythat is its sort of like
pornography you know it when you see it  a number of 2 is certainly consistent with that  but
choosing a level at the upper end of what people have talked about in the comfort zone will help
allay politicians fears that were inflation nutters  it will also help alleviate the fear that we are
insufficiently concerned about the second element of the dual mandate and will suggest that we
do care about output fluctuations  i worry a bit that if we had an objective of 1 percent we
could get into the following bind  to be serious about getting there which would be critical
because otherwise wed lose our credibility we would need to raise the federal funds rate from
current levels as the simulation indicated to convince people of our seriousness and that would
help bring inflation expectations down  i worry that doing so would make the political
environment very hostile and we could lose support for a numerical inflation objectivethat
would be very costlyand could weaken the support for our independence  thats the reason i
tend to be driven to the 2 percent number
let me tell you about the one downside that i think is serious and that we have to think
about  there is a downside to a 2 percent pce objective or a cpi equivalent appropriately
adjusted  the downside is that we may get the opposite of the automatic stabilizer that was
talked about in the rs document in the context of pricelevel targeting  im going to use an
allusion that dave stockton mentioned which i thought was great  it just shows that dave is
watching too many cartoons  choosing the 2 percent number has something of the flavor of
shooting an arrow and then painting the bullseye around the arrow it seems to have an element
of opportunism to it  heres the problem with that kind of opportunism  it can create very bad
expectations dynamics just the opposite of the benefits of the pricelevel targeting  say in the
future you chose a number  if people think that you might change it again when you overshoot
the objective then inflation expectations would rise because they think youre going to raise the
objective  that would then cause inflation to rise more than it otherwise would and you would
get more output fluctuations  so it has sort of the opposite of the benefits that were discussed
the result is that you could actually do much worse in terms of achieving the dual mandate  you
could do worse both on inflation and on output fluctuations which is something that we dont
want to do  im not sure how big a problem this is if we communicate carefully the permanence
of the number  here i agree strongly with president lacker that its very important not to change
the number unless there are very strong scientific reasons to do so  the if memo helped me
here too in pointing out that many countries chose a number based on where they were  they
actually shot the arrow and then painted the target around it and it did not create a huge problem
in terms of commitment  norway is an example that comes to mind and i know a similar issue
came up for sweden as well
let me quickly finish with questions 5 6 and 7  ive thought about this a lot more and
now i want to take back something i said at the first meeting in which i participated  was it
october  this goes to show that i dont think consistency is always necessary it has benefits
but sometimes you do need to change your mind  i think it would be a very bad idea to take a
survey of the participants on the objective or publish the participants views in the minutes  my
view has to do with the opportunism issuedoing so would make it much more likely that the
inflation objective could change from year to year  that really does worry me because it would
make a commitment to the inflation objective harder and we would get the bad expectation
dynamics which could be problematic  so as i said i think that we need to come to a consensus
and make it clear that the objective will change only if there is a good scientific reason for doing
sothat is a change in our view say on measurement error or something along those lines
i really dont have much to say about the issue of a trial run  a trial run for producing a
forecast narrative is a very good idea  i want to mention that having a forecast narrative might
change the timing in terms of the minutes not just twice a year because i would advocate that we
do this four times a year  very likely it could be part of a monetary policy report which is
something that i would advocate  that report would have to be issued and then the congress
might want to set up testimony about it and the likelihood is that they would want it to be before
the minutes to get maximum attention for the hearings  we saw this occurrence in sweden for
example and i would suspect that it would be true here  in that context i think that we would
more likely have to do the discussion of the forecast among us a little quicker than the minutes
and we should just be aware of that  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes  president lacker
mr lacker  id like to respectfully just ask a question
chairman bernanke  sure
mr lacker  to try to clarify your views governor mishkinif inflation were now 4
percent and we began conducting optimal policy do you think the inflation rate under that
optimal policy from now onten or twenty years from nowwould be 4 percent
mr mishkin  no definitely not  again you have to take into account the welfare
considerations of the steady state which are extremely important  my view is that any number
between 1 and 2 is reasonable  i tend to be a little more reluctant about 1 because i do worry
more about the lowerbound problem  i also worry a bit about the issue of potential deflationary
effects on balance sheets so my number tends to be a little higher than your number in the steady
state  numbers above 3 are not sustainable and they would have very negative welfare
consequences  im willing to choose 2 because when i assess the literature and ask whether
there is a difference in terms of the steady state and in terms of the welfare benefits from
2 percent versus 1 i just cant find it  then the transition costs become an issue as do the
political considerations  that is why we come to somewhat different views  at 4 percent i
would be advocating our bringing out the baseball bat i would agree that we would have to raise
rates a lot to convince the markets  in fact this is what volcker had to do and he was a great
federal reserve chairman  luckily were not in that situation right now
mr lacker  so your view about the steadystate optimal inflation rate is what
mr mishkin  im indifferent between 1 and 2  however that doesnt mean that i
have a zone of indifference about choosing a number  i think you have to pick a number  the
experts in monetary economics might have a preference  but if after reading the literature you
asked them whether they thought there was much difference between 1 and 2 i would be
extremely shocked if they said yes
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i too want to thank the staff for really a
great piece of work and a lot of coordination which made this possible  first i want to say at
the outset that i do not want to move forward at this point in providing a numerical definition of
the committees inflation objective  second regarding the enhanced use of a survey of
economic projections i support the release of increased information on the economic outlook
along the lines suggested in the memo  to be a little more specific i would like to assure
everyone that i believe it is important to maintain a clear commitment to price stability  thats
not what ive been disagreeing with at all
however in looking at the benefits and costs of adopting a numerical inflation objective
i believe the practical benefits are relatively small at this time and the costs are relatively larger
than the benefits  therefore i suggest that we not do it  regarding the benefits there appears to
be little difference in economic performance of inflationtargeting and noninflationtargeting
countries that we are looking at  also i have not seen convincing evidence that inflation
expectations are better anchored with an explicit numerical objective than with our current
methods of communicating and acting toward an environment of stable prices or at least low
inflation  in contrast i think the costs at this time are a little higher  the political implications
are important  i think about the law of unintended consequences or some of the longerterm
reactionsand not just those of the congress but also the public more generally  we have a
commitment to a dual mandate  if we also have a commitment to a specific price target i think
that over time the arguments will mountand i would understand them mountingthat we need
a specific target for output  then were going to get ourselves trying to balance this out and
frankly i think it will be difficult  so that is why im very reluctant to have a numerical target
put forward when we have a dual mandate that suggests otherwise in terms of balancing
now if we do go forward where do i come out in terms of the numerical objective  i
would go with both a core pce and a core cpi  despite the general superiority of the pce and
ignoring the difficulties in pricing its nonmarket components the cpi has advantages in
communicating to the public which others have mentioned  also tipsderived measures of
inflation expectations are based on the cpi  now i would prefer a point goal of 2 percent for the
core cpi and 1 percent for the core pce and i would specify a flexible time horizon   i agree
that longer is better and i wont put a number forward at this point
turning to the group questions i would not support trying to achieve a consensus on the
inflation objective  i do not think we can choose an inflation objective that binds future
committees  we dont have a statutory mandate and peoples opinions will change as
personalities and experience change  thus we would need to revisit this issue on an annual
basis and i think that would be difficult  it seems to me that the consensus view is the de facto
inflation objective  for this reason given my earlier comment i would prefer simply surveying
committee members on their views about what constitutes price stability  finally if we go this
route i would recommend that we publish simply the range and the central tendency of the
members objectives
as i have already said i support the proposed trial run  i thought the summary of the
economic projections provided in vinces memo was good and useful and i think we should go
forward with that  the more difficult issue for me is how to convey the forecast uncertainty
while it is important to convey the uncertainty surrounding the forecast i would not combine
members central tendency forecasts with the frbus confidence intervals  i think youre
mixing things here both in terms of what youre trying to talk about and then who is talking
about it  is one the committees and is the other the staffs  is one referring to one thing or to
something else  i think you will create confusion over time and so i would be reluctant to go
down that path mr chairman  thank you for the opportunity to comment
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  id also like to lend my voice to the vote of
thanks to the staff on what i thought was an excellent set of memos  i think the staff did an
outstanding job in summarizing a lot of the nuances and the details that are involved
perhaps it comes as no surprise that im in favor of defining the committees price
objective numerically and announcing that goal to the public  i believe that specifying our long
run price stability objective numerically would focus our policy discussions and help anchor
expectations  by reducing the publics uncertainty about our goal longrun expectations would
become less responsive to changes in shortrun inflation  this should help enhance monetary
policys flexibility to respond to economic shocks as we may deem appropriate  thus rather
than being unduly constraining i believe it would actually add to our flexibility  in this way its
consistent with the other goals of monetary policy and increases monetary policy effectiveness
it would also increase social welfare to the extent that it helps us avoid timeinconsistent policy
since we know welfare under commitment generally exceeds welfare under discretion when
agents are forward looking  thus i believe a numerical goal would be a longrun anchor to our
monetary policy and help coordinate our own discussions of what appropriate policy might be
now as vince laid out the questions we have to make a number of decisions in making
that numerical goal operational  i feel more strongly about some aspects of the design than about
others and many of the choices are interrelated  for example a long horizon should mean a
tighter control range  a long horizon makes the choice between headline and core less
important  a long horizon makes the choice of core in fact less compelling  i think that any
proposals will have their pros and cons  as i said im not necessarily wedded to all of the
particulars but i will make a proposal  but let me emphatically stress that what is more
important than the specifics is that we agree on a numerical objective and a horizon for its
achievement
regarding which price index i prefer the headline cpi even though its likely to be
harder to control and forecast in the short run than the core  many foreign central banks with
experience have tended to move toward the headline cpi number indicating that it can in fact
work  the headline cpi is a measure thats more understood by the public so the
communication arguments are important here  unlike the pce as has been mentioned a couple
of times or the gdp deflator the cpi is not revised which helps us in assessing our
accountability in reaching our goal  i also prefer headline to core for our goal because i dont
want to convey the idea that we are insensitive to the wider array of prices that influence
behaviorparticularly because as governor mishkin indicated the stochastic processes or
properties of individual elements of the cpi may change over time  if we started defining a
subset of prices we could find ourselves in trouble  i think we would also have the opportunity
to use the core in our communications when explaining why we might or might not react with
policy to a temporary blip in headline inflation  i view focusing on headline and using the core
for other purposes as a means of enhancing our communication efforts  again this practice is
similar to the practices of other central banks that announce their inflation goals  of course i
think its going to be terribly important for us to consider how we will respond to and
communicate about the inevitable misses from our target
regarding a point goal or range i strongly favor announcing a point goal  in reality
there is a range around this point that reflects the precision with which we policymakers think we
can control inflation and this control range will differ depending on the inflation measure used
and the time horizon selected  however im reluctant to announce a range as part of our
inflation goal because i think it would be very difficult to ensure that the public would not
interpret it as a range over which we are indifferent  so for the headline cpi i would specify
and announce a target of 1 percent  thats consistent with our goal of price stability and the
estimated measurement bias of the cpi of being something slightly less than 1 percent  i picked
1 percent because i take seriously our mandate for price stability  since i do not believe that
there is any longrun tradeoff between inflation and employment we have no reason not to seek
and meet that goal over a reasonable period  i recognize that some may feel that a 1 percent
target is too low as the risk of deflation or zero bound restrictions on nominal interest rates might
call for a greater cushion  i understand those arguments and they are certainly plausible  but
for various reasons some articulated by people around this table im less concerned about our
ability or the economys ability to deal with those issues both of deflation and zero bounds  but
i accept that some people may have more concern about it than i do
regarding time horizons i feel strongly that we should specify a time horizon by which
we think we can achieve our target so that we can be held accountable for meeting or missing a
goal  since i favor using the headline cpi which is a little more difficult to control more
volatile than a core measure i think a twoyear horizon would be appropriate and indeed
achievable given the typical shocks that hit the economy and the volatility of the cpi  for
example for the past ten years the standard deviation of the monthly twentyfourmonth cpi
headline inflation rate has been about 05 percent  i could also make the case that initially we
may want to consider a slightly longer horizon especially if we choose a number like 1 percent
and given that we are currently well above 2 percent  specifying a longer horizon at first may
provide markets with more opportunity to adjust to the new regime and mitigate some of the
transition costs  as we converge to our target we might be able to shorten the horizon  i much
prefer that idea to adjusting the goal  i think the goal ought to be the goal and we use the
horizon to give us some flexibility depending not only on initial conditions but also perhaps in
future discussions on the nature of the shocks that may cause us to do that  i dont like the idea
of not picking an optimal target simply because were not there yet  i think thats not the right
strategy
there remains the issue of how we treat deviations from our goalthat is whether we let
bygones be bygones or whether for example when inflation has been above our target for a
year we must get it below our target for a year  our chosen inflation goal will imply a price
level path with that goal  we need to decide whether or not we will permit permanent deviations
from that pricelevel path  deviations from the pricelevel path occur when inflation deviates
from our goal  if inflation increases above our goal for a time then we would need to bring
inflation below our goal to return to the pricelevel path that was consistent with our initially
announced inflation goal  similarly if inflation moved below our goal we would need to have a
period of abovetarget inflation to return to the price path  alternatively the committee might
decide to accept permanent deviations from the price path and choose to implement policy only
to return to the inflation level  i would prefer the former as a pricelevel path because it prevents
base drift and i suspect that we will on average more likely be above the target than below and
the ensuing gradual erosion of purchasing power will be higher than we might have anticipated
in either case i think its important regardless of which way we decide that we make that
choice consciously and weigh the costs and benefits of it and decide which regime we want to be
in
i do think its critical that the fomc members reach a consensus or at least a decision
on the goals and the definition of price stability and essentially not dispute those in public  i
dont think members need to agree on the model of the economy or the channel through which
monetary policy affects the economy  indeed given the state of economic science the
differences in the models and the channels can actually aid in policy formation  however the
point of announcing a numerical definition of price stability is to anchor expectations and
improve our accountability  without agreement on that definition the benefits of such an
announcement would be critically diminished  the committee may want to periodically review
the definition of particulars such as the horizon as it gains experience operating under this
structure but i think its very important that we reach a consensus on our announced goal
while i have offered my own choices on the particulars i believe that they really are of
secondary importance to our public commitment to an objective
as far as the trial run is concerned i strongly favor having a trial run for producing a
forecast narrative in may and i agree with the discussion last time in that i like the idea of doing
it four times a year  i also like the idea of incorporating a forecast narrative into the minutes
which gives participants the opportunity to comment on the draft narrative  this is not the only
way to proceed but i think that it is a good first step and that refinements can follow  as i
mentioned earlier our discussion this morning highlighted the real need for us to have a way of
communicating our policy views more effectively and outside the narrow confines of the policy
statements as they are currently constructed
regarding the narrative itself i have two comments  first i suggest adding the assumed
policy path as a variable in the forecast  participants are asked to assume appropriate monetary
policy and conditioning on policy paths that can differ across participants embeds differences in
participants preferences over outcomes as well as differences across their models  if we are
thinking about the forecast as a communication device that enhances the transparency of our
policymaking process then we want to convey something about the reaction function that is
likely to arise out of our committees decisionmaking process  aggregated information such as
the range and central tendency of the fed funds rate in the fourth quarter of each of the three
years of the forecast as we do with the unemployment rate might be useful without holding the
committee to any particular path  i think the idea of conveying information regarding the
uncertainty of the forecast is also important so that the public does not place too much emphasis
on point forecasts or narrow ranges  moreover uncertainty is clearly larger than the range of the
point forecasts of the committee and yet im not sure as has been mentioned already that using
the forecast standard errors out of the frbus model is the best solution since they are not
consistent with the forecast that was generated by the committee  we might for example even
consider asking committee members when they submit their forecasts to submit their own range
of uncertainty at the fourquarter horizons and then use those estimates to create something like a
fan chart  in any case im looking forward to a trial run in may  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me start by way of background simply by
saying that while there may be some good theoretical arguments for adopting a numerical
inflation objective i actually view this consideration as very practical  what were talking about
here are ways to improve external and internal communication and accountability  to the extent
that communication is improved it should certainly aid decisionmaking within the committee
decisionmaking within the private sector communication with the congress and others about our
objectives and tactics and so forth  so i view those as very practical issues not theories
as far as the specific questions yes i do believe that the committees price objective
should be defined numerically  as far as the preferred price index im really fairly indifferent
about that  i think perhaps whats most important is that we pick one and stick with it  the core
pce has the value at the moment of being the one that weve been focusing on  its in the
numbers that we submit to the congress but i dont think that is necessarily determinative  if
we wanted to go to the core cpi or the overall cpi actually those alternatives would be
acceptable to me  that consideration is a second or third order one at least from my perspective
as far as the question about a point goal or a range i have a proposal though its not an
original one  i propose that we say that our target is something less than but close to 2 percent
the ecb target  let me try to explain why i think thats a good idea  id start with governor
mishkins point that i dont believe that there is a lot to be gained in the steady state whether
were at a little below 2 percent or at 1 percent or even lower  i think a little less than 2 percent
is fully consistent with an objective of low stable inflation which is what were really talking
about here  moreover the fact that it doesnt have a bottom to the range means that if we get
lucky or if theres an opportunity to bring inflation down below 2 percent we could take
advantage of that and that would be all to the good  i have some concerns with a range or a
target that focuses on 1 or something even lower because i question how credible it is based in
part on our experience in 2003 when there may have been some anxiety externally but there was
a lot of anxiety internally about the course of inflation the zero bound how policy was going to
be conducted and how effective it was going to be  those memories are pretty clear in my
mind and i dont believe we ought to select a range or a target with which we are not
comfortable when push comes to shove as it may at some point
as far as the time horizon i would say normally something like two to three years
normally is an important word because i can imagine circumstances in which that time frame
is not appropriate  but theres a tradeoff here  if the time frame is too short were probably
going to confront more interest rate volatility than we want as we try to achieve the inflation
objective  if its too long its meaningless  so in my judgment you have to come out
somewhere in the middle and my best judgment about that at the moment at least is two to three
years but i guess i would be willing to be persuaded otherwise
as far as whether the committee participants should jointly decide on the goal i think
the answer to that is yes  im not sure about exactly the mechanism for achieving that wed
probably have to reaffirm the goal every year as the composition of the committee changed but
i think thats far preferable to the other alternatives i can think of  if that is not possible and we
go to something like the proposal in question number 6surveying the committee members
my reaction is that it is probably another appropriate place for a trial run  we can see what we
get back and what we make of it at the end of the day  how should the public be informed
well if we do adopt a numerical objective at some point were going to have to tell the public
because thats the honest way to go  even if we didnt want to wed be talking about it here
and sooner or later it would become public  i dont have any problem with that
just a word or two about the forecasting exercise and the possibility of a trial runi am
all in favor of that  i think well probably learn some things from it and thats the intent
having said that i guess the one bit of caution that i would offer as we go down this path is that
i think its important to illustrate the degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast and so
forth  at the same time we want to make sure that we dont raise uncertainty about our ultimate
policy objectivesabout our commitment to price stability and its relation to the other half of
the dual mandate  so we have to make sure as we illustrate uncertainty that we separate
uncertainty about the outlook from uncertainty about our objectives  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also want to thank the staff for the
memos that were sent out before the meeting  they were very helpful in preparing for this
meeting
i am in favor of defining our price stability objective numerically  as others have noted
being more explicit about our price objective will enhance both external and internal policy
discussions improve our transparency and help coordinate the publics expectations about
inflation  although my expectations about the gains that we can expect from adopting a
numerical inflation objective are modest for the short term i think that over the long term the
benefits will prove to be more significant
my preferred price index is the headline cpi  i prefer the cpi mainly because it is
familiar and better understood by the public than other inflation measures  in addition the fact
that the tax code social security benefits tips and many other contracts are indexed to the cpi
means that people probably focus more on it than alternative measures  also research done by
my staff suggests that both nearterm and longerterm household inflation expectations are more
strongly correlated with the behavior of the cpi and its core measures than with the pce
alternatives  i understand that a lot of people prefer the pce because of the fairly substantial role
of owners equivalent rent in the cpi  however its worth noting that the small weight placed
on the oer in the pce is a result of the larger weights placed on medical services and
nonmarket activities each of which comes with its own problems  because a numerical
objective could provide predictability and confidence in the purchasing power of money i favor
expressing our objective in terms of an overall inflation measure rather than the core measure
though core measures are certainly important for helping us to disentangle the trend in headline
inflation from temporary influences i think it is the overall inflation rate that is important in a
welfare sense  for that reason it makes sense to me to express our objectives in terms of the
overall measure
if the committee were to choose the headline cpi i would favor a midpoint target of
2 percent and an acceptable range around the midpoint of plus or minus 1 percentage point  if
the majority of the committee prefers the pce i would choose a midpoint of 1 percent  a few
years ago i gave a speech on this issue and noted that i would choose 1 percent but because of
the revisions that were received last year i moved that up to 1 percent  whichever measure we
might choose i would like to see the objective expressed in terms of an average over the medium
term say three to five years  to me the real discipline of an objective comes when it is
measurable but also realistic  so stating our objective in terms of an average achieved over a few
years provides a reasonable way for the public to explicitly gauge our performance  i should be
clear however that i dont think that any deviation from this performance objective should
automatically trigger action by the committee  however it is quite reasonable and useful for us
to provide an explanation or a plan of action depending on the circumstances if we look over a
recent threeyear to fiveyear period and find that we missed our stated inflation goal or if we
look forward and see that were likely to miss that goal
to the question of how often we set an objective i agree with president lacker
governor mishkin and a few others that we should just set it and forget it  laughter  the staff
may tell us that there are some governance issues to address and it might be desirable for voting
members to reconfirm the objective at the start of each year  but the presumption should be that
once its chosen the objective should be reframed only if there is a compelling and easily
explained reason to do so
in regard to the questions pertaining to the group my first choice would be to generate a
consensus objective and communicate the desired nearterm range to the public  if we cant
agree on the desirability of this option i do favor sharing individual preferences as part of our
discussion in the committee and i would have no objections to having my preferred numerical
objective made public in the meeting minutes  obviously this conversation is going to be public
five years from now through the transcript anyway  i do believe that sharing our own thinking
about inflation objectives among ourselves has value  so i wouldnt considerate it a dealbreaker
if others feel that we should keep this an internal discussion only  however if we do have a
conversation about it as others have pointed out i presume that it is going to be reflected in the
minutes and then people are going to wonder why were not sharing the information publicly
so it may be difficult to keep the details under wraps once we start making it public that we are
having these conversations
regarding the proposal for the forecast narrative trial run i think it is a good step for the
committee to take  i would also like to commend vincent and his staff for providing a useful
model  i like what the staff has proposed including the summary information provided in the
two tables and in chart 1  i only have two changes to suggest  others have already commented
on one of them and that is the issue around uncertainty  i do think its important for us to
convey that there is some uncertainty around our forecast but im not sure that using the
frbusgenerated confidence intervals is the right way to go  but we can talk about that detail
at some other point  the other issue is the reference to potential output  it may be a good idea
for committee members to comment on individual estimates of potential growth but it may not
be a good idea to use the staff reference to potential growth without explicit guidance from the
committee  but both of these are details  i support moving forward with the trial run and am
looking forward to seeing the outcome of that  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i too want to thank the staff  theyve done
a terrific job in helping us with this  im going to try to address the questions in vincents memo
with a little variation in order  on the first question i do believe that the fomc should have a
numerical inflation objective  weve discussed this before  briefly i think it would improve
internal policy discussions  importantly i think it would allow for clearer communication with
the public and the benefit of that is to help anchor inflation expectations and enhance the scope
for monetary policy to stabilize output  additional transparency would also foster greater
accountability which i think is important  all in all i dont think these gains would be
enormous  but they do come out in the plus column when i weigh them against the potential
costs  a cost i worry about and would not be prepared to pay is deemphasis on the other part of
our dual mandatemaximum sustainable employment  i worry that such deemphasis could
occur in the minds of the public and even affect our own decisions  so i think a numerical
inflation goal has to be enunciated in the context of clear and convincing statements about our
commitment to both objectives
like governor mishkin i thought it important to proceed out of order  i too would like
to turn to question 4 on the time frame because i think its extremely important to address that
first  i consider it critical that we define a numerical inflation objective as a longrun goal not at
a fixed time horizon  i would find it very hard to support a numerical objective without a long
run horizon to provide a lot of flexibility to respond to output and employment considerations  i
believe that a fixed time horizon is inconsistent with the dual mandate  the longrun nature of
the inflation objective would have to be clearly explained to the public in the context of the dual
mandate and i think we would need to stress that we would always take the implications for
nearterm economic and financial stability into account when deciding how to move toward our
inflation objective  ive said this on several previous occasions  i think our chairman proposed
a brilliant formulation of this in his remarks in st louis in 2003 and ive been long attracted to
the language and views that he put forward in that speech on how to express this
now let me turn to questions of which index and what number  on these issues i am
flexible  over the long run the various price measures appear fairly closely linked  on
methodological grounds of course im enamored with things like the marketbased core pce
and the chain cpi certainly has its attractions  laughter  a couple of years ago after our first
discussion of this in 2005 i decided to enunciate in my own speeches a socalled comfort zone
and i talked about it in terms of the pce  but partly because of that experiment i too have
come to appreciate the value of public familiarity  in my contact with the public when i start to
talk about the inflation rate and the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding
food and energy i still see quite a few blank stares  laughter  i dont think its just me  the
fomc has been providing pce price inflation projections in our monetary policy report since
february 2000  many of us have been talking about our goals in terms of the pce price index
but the cpi is still entrenched in the minds of the public as the measure of inflation  thats
probably why central banks around the globe define their inflation objectives in terms of the cpi
like others ive also found that the public is quite skeptical probably rightly so of measures
that exclude food and energy  those are important outofpocket expenses  i agree with the
argument that if we have a longrun goal there is an advantage to using a total rather than a core
index  of course we can refer to the behavior of the core index in explaining what we see going
forward in our own internal deliberations  so at this point i think ive changed my mind and i
would agree that total cpi is probably now my preferred alternative  but again i dont feel
strongly and i could go along with core pce
with regard to a point value for the inflation goal or a range i found very interesting in
the if paper that many central banks have both  the point serves as a focal point and i think
that there are good reasons particularly as governor mishkin emphasized for having a focal
point  the range seems useful as a communication device to remind the public that inflation
control is not perfect and that inflation is going to vary  im comfortable with that approach  as
for a specific number again i think economic theory and empirical evidencei agree with
governor mishkinsuggest that the welfare function is pretty flat over a range of possible
values  i dont think we should aim at zero properly measured because some cushion against the
zero bound seems prudent  i also worry about an adverse interaction with downward nominal
wage rigidity  that hasnt been important in recent years because productivity growth has been
high  but if productivity growth were to decline i believe that could become pertinent
however there is also nothing to be gained by setting a goal higher than where inflation
expectations are currently anchored  i remain comfortable with the goal that i enunciated some
time agoa longrun inflation objective of 1 percent for the core pce inflation rate  i agree
with governor mishkin that we have to take transition costs into account  its a question of
weighing the gains from being at a better number against the transition costs and i thought about
that tradeoff when i decided on 1  i know were not there and i guess i decided that the
tradeoff was worth making  i dont in any way want to say that the case was compelling but i
could certainly continue to live with that number  to cast it in terms of the overall cpi i think a
comparable number given the average measurement bias would be about 2 percent  the very
first fomc discussion of this topic that i participated in which was in january 1996 came out
with a numerical inflation objective of exactly 2 percent and i think we were referring to the cpi
at that time  as for my preferred target range for headline cpi which is more volatile i translate
the 1 to 2 percent for core pce that ive been talking about into a 1 to 3 percent range  again
id emphasize the 2 percent goal for the cpi and stress that the fomc would not be indifferent
among values inside the range
let me now turn to questions about the formulation of an inflation goal as a group
decision and the communication of that goal  ive long thought the best way to make this
decision is to arrive at a consensus or general agreement among the full set of fomc
participants  that is how we have traditionally decided on communication issues since we do all
have to live with the consequences  i favor that approach over a survey  i might support a
survey but i really think this is a preferable approach by far  it would produce much less
muddled communication  statement of a consensus view is probably preferable to a formal vote
which in some sense might up the ante visvis the congress  it might be appropriate for the
committee to revisit the setting of this objective from time to time  presumably it would not
and should not change very often  there could be reasons at some point that it might change  i
hope it wouldnt change very often but perhaps it should be reaffirmed and reconsidered
annually  if we do reach a consensus on the numerical objective i think it should be expressed
in the minutes
turning to the forecast narrative i very strongly support the proposed experiment  i
thought the staff summary of the january economic projections showed that a useful minutes
style narrative could be produced and i think that process is going to work even more efficiently
if we provide individual narratives of the type that are suggested for the trial run  on details i
agree with the point that president hoenig and i believe president pianalto made about the
confidence intervals  i think we should examine the track records for a broader range of
forecasts our own past projections those of the cbo and others and experiment with that  i
would also like to give some support to president plossers suggestion that at least in the
experiment we might want to include the federal funds rate or our own individual projections for
the federal funds rate
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you mr chairman  i suppose it comes as no surprise to anybody
who has been at the table here listening to these discussions over the pastit seems like forever but
i guess it has been only a couple of years laughterthat im not in favor of a numerical price
objective  however its funnyas president yellen was going through her thoughts that lead her
to believe that the benefits outweigh the costs i find myself in agreement with a lot of what she
said  i just come out for the side on which the costs outweigh the benefits
i found the material disseminated for this meeting very useful  i would have liked a bit
more time to look at some of it but it was very useful in my own thinking particularly vinces
encouragement implicit or explicit to think about ones personal definition of price stability  so i
did that a biti thought about that definition as opposed to just whether or not i was in favor of a
numerical target  i guess it comes as no surprise that my definition of price stability tends to be
more qualitative than quantitative  its a rate of inflation not a price level thats so low and stable
that it doesnt interfere with decisionmaking as businesses invest and consumers save and plan for
the future  achieving a rate of inflation that meets that sort of definition is the best we can do as a
central bank over the long run to achieve both of our objectivesthat is price stability and
maximum sustainable growthand i would take governor mishkins thinking on this in an
environment of financial stability  i know that this definition sounds simplistic it certainly isnt
original  but i think it effectively conveys the challenges we face as we strive to meet both of our
goals in the context of changing economic realities
i do recognize however that even in the context of a qualitative definition of price stability
some quantification is useful as one thinks about current progress  in that regard all other things
being equal i would worry about rates of inflation above 3 percent  similarly rates below 1 percent
seem to carry with them the potential for instability and certainly a lot of concern around this table
as we saw in 2003 and as president stern mentioned  based on the research ive seen i think it is
hard to distinguish the benefits of 2 versus 2 or 2 or 1 versus 2  i think our experience over
the years that ive been on the committee suggests that the 1to3 range is a pretty good definition
at least for the time being of what it means to have very stable prices  i have some doubts about
whether theres any single optimum inflation rate  i think things change and if we chose a
particular number as the optimum inflation rate it might cause us to fail to appreciate an evolution
in the way the economy works and to exercise our judgment
i think judgment is very important in policy formation  its important that we exercise
judgment about the right policy in a timely way and im afraid that stating a particular number as
an optimum inflation rate would end up making us more numbersdetermined and less judgment
determined and i think that would be a step backward in terms of policy formation  so although
my own notion of what constitutes stable prices is useful to me as a policymaker i think its
important that it not be seen as being determinant to policy action  one reason that being explicit
about price stability is thought to be useful is that it can shape market expectations  but price
stability isnt our only goal  maximum sustainable growth is a goal as well  in the short run there
can be tradeoffs between the two  markets need to know that shortrun policy will always be a
balancing act  we can tell them that but the action of setting a numerical inflation target will speak
louder than words  it will say we value one goal over the other  as the material prepared for this
meeting points out very well the benefits of a numerical target need to be weighed against the
potential for harm  communication and transparency may seem to be improved but confusion
could be created as well and that confusion could extend from the public to the congress which
would be difficult from time to time  now i know that we can meet all these concerns  i know that
we have a wide array of ways in which we can communicate  i know given all the many many
words that have been written on this subject that there are many ways to make clear all of the
tradeoffs that go into choosing a particular objective  but i wonder along with president fisher
why we want to spend our time and our political capital right now or anytime in the near future to
ensure that were conveying all the subtleties of an inflation target  i dont see that spending time
and political capital doing it brings us enough advantage
neither the market nor the public needs to be told a number to believe that we seek low and
stable rates of inflation  we have the credibility that comes from a long period of success on this
front  markets form expectations based on what weve accomplished not just on what we say we
will do  obviously if we didnt have some success here or if we were at the start of an inflation
control process like brazil or mexico perhaps at points of time in the past we could benefit from
establishing a target  even then wed have to have the right followup policy actions and results or
the target wouldnt be at all credible  our track record as a central bank proves our commitment to
low and stable rates of inflation and shows that were accountable for our actions  that
commitment and accountability work to shape expectations and combined with sound policy
would keep inflation low and stable in the future  in the end that will shape the best environment
for saving investing and longterm growth
now its clear and i have known this all alongonly a few of us think along the same
lines and maybe nobody thinks along the same lines that i do  so let me focus on some of the
answers from my perspective to the questions that are being posed  as an individual do i believe
that the committees price objectives should be defined numerically  no  i think the benefits of
doing that could be outweighed by the potential for harm  if we have to do it and that may happen
what is my preferred price index  well mine is not unlike that of janet and some others  i come
down on the side of headline cpi i think it encompasses the range of costs that are important to
people  food is important to people  energy is important to people  conveying our concerns about
inflation really needs to be done in terms of a headline number and i would pick the headline cpi
im also in favor of a fairly long and maybe flexible time horizon  the two of those work together
if you pick a headline number over a longish period the headline number isnt as volatile as it is in a
short period  it is something on which we can focus over a longish period of time as a goal thats
easily understood easily communicated and reached over that longish period
do i have a point goal or a range  as i mentioned earlier im more or less comfortable
right now with an inflation goal in a range of 1 to 3 percent  in terms of where in that range we
should be at any time i think its hard to make the call as to whether 1 is better than 2 or 2  i do
set some store by stability over time  like most of the rest of you id be worried if were in that
range but we thought we were going to get out of it rapidly at some point  as for the time horizon i
said a fairly longish period of time  i would go at least three years maybe five years or maybe an
indefinite time horizon because i think its important as janet discussed that we recognize both our
goals  if you pick too short or too fixed a time horizon you do imply that at some point youre
going to sacrifice the growth goal for the inflation goal  now i realize that if you set a goal you do
try to manage tradeoffs that way  but i think that youll be shaping expectations that when the
threeyear period or the fiveyear period ends youll be taking actions  maybe you dont want
those expectations to be out in the market
as a group should committee participants arrive at a consensus view of its goal  if we
arrive at a view i dont think a consensus view is necessary  it might undermine the diversity of
viewpoint that i think is the strength of the committee  if we had a consensus view that we arrived
at either formally or informally it would have to be communicated to the public  with regard to the
next questionparticipants being surveyed regarding their preferred level of a numerical
objectivei think that is sort of what were doing now  its probably helpful for internal
communication that i know where everybody else stands and you know where i standits
beneficial to the information flow around the committee  so if a survey of participants is done in a
way that is useful for developing policy and for communicating among ourselves i think it would
be helpful  if its done in a way that tries to force consensus im not so sure it would be as useful
all of this discussion will be public in the transcript  the fact that were having a discussion about
how each of us feels about price stability will be made public  im comfortable with its being public
in the transcript  whatever summary is done in the minutes is probably good enough unless we
should come to the decision that we are going to have a numerical price objective in which case it
has to be public and would be in the minutes and might even be subject to some further
communication
i think the trial run will be interesting  im all in favor of providing the information for a
trial run in may  i have a hard time seeing how you do a forecast narrative particularly if it has a
minutesstyle format like the draft that vince sent us in two weeks and then the minutes in three
weeks  i think the trial run is going to be useful in showing us how that feels  it may suggest that
we just do minutes in two weeks and incorporate the narrative into the minutes  but well see how
the trial run goes
i also want to be counted in the camp of people who worry about the range of uncertainty
the fan charts  i think theyre very hard to describe  just looking at for example our confidence
intervals around gdpour central tendency is slightly below 3 percent in most of 08 but our 90
percent confidence interval is somewhere between zero and 6  i dont know what the public makes
of that and i dont know if we further anything about our own credibility in explicitly identifying
that range of uncertainty over that short period  i have no doubt that the math is all beautiful and
correct  i just think that as a communication device the chart really is deficient  we need to think
about how to convey uncertainty which we certainly have in a way that is helpful and not hurtful
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  having been a president for three weeks i hope i can still get away
with some tentative or preliminary remarks on this subject  there really are two questions  the
first question is whether or not to go forward and the second is if we do go forward how to
implement it  regarding the first question having only today been privy to these discussions im
not going to make up my mind quite yet  but i would like to make a few comments on the how
side of the question in the event that we do go forward
first i favor a quantitative price objective  as to whether it is an explicit objective and
whether it has a point goal or a range i can see pros and cons to both  the point goal can help in
influencing longterm inflation expectations and an indifference range can be more compatible with
the dual mandate  on balance i favor a point goal with comfortable bands  regarding exact
numbers ive not settled on a specific number but i would think that something in the range of
1 to 2 percent depending upon the index thats chosen is a reasonable guide to policy and
compatible with the dual mandate  on my preferred price index ive been influenced by the
discussion today  my starting point was core pce based upon consistency with the past  im more
convinced now that an overall measure makes sense because we should be consistent with the
pocketbook experience of the public since were communicating to the broad public  so i would
favor one of the overall measures  id like to stress that i am very much in favor of an approach that
minimizes the political risk of conflict with the congress and dilution of the principle of central
bank independence  for this reason i think that an unspecified mediumterm time horizon would
work best especially at the initial stage
i believe that flexibility going into this policy is sensible and important  ive thought a bit
about how we really ground this decision and ground the specific choices that we make  in
simplistic terms i would say it should workmeaning that the policy should enable the
achievement of actual outcomes  given the difficulty and the complexity that im learning about
and the many domestic and international uncertainties i think we should be flexible enough to have
high confidence that well achieve the stated objectives  foreign central banks have changed the
details of implementation of inflation targetingsuch changes have apparently not affected their
credibilityand i believe that the fomc should be able to do the same thing  finally i believe
that for inflation targeting to be effective its goals should be communicated as a substantial
consensus  im making some distinction between the reflection of an actual consensus versus the
communication of some degree of unity on the part of the committee  mr chairman let me just
end there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think that yes we ought to define a committee
price objective numerically but its a close call and will depend on how the objective is
implemented  the benefits will be small but if we do it right the costs will be even smaller  the
benefits include slightly better anchored inflation expectations  the evidence across countries is
that the difference between inflationtargeting countries and noninflationtargeting countries on this
is very small  clearer discussions protection against cumulating changes in inflation either up or
downunder one of your successors mr chairman  laughter  i do think theres confusion out
there because many fomc participants have enunciated 1 to 2 percent comfort zones  people
assume that thats the committees target  its not mine  the committee has never voted on it  i
think we need to clarify that fact and frankly i hope we dont come out quite where 1 to 2 percent
core pce comfort zones are
the risk as president yellen noted is that the emphasis on inflation will detract from the
emphasis on output stabilization  i think output stabilization has value in and of itself  it is very
hard to plan personal spending when there are business cycles  output stabilization is not only a
means to inflation stabilization  we ought to pay attention to it and i think theres a risk that we
could pay too much attention to inflation and not enough to output  governor mishkin actually
crystallized my concerns when he said that he hoped that discussions in this committee would focus
on the inflation path  thats exactly what im worried about rick  laughter  the committee
should focus on the inflation path but not only the inflation path
mr mishkin  i agree with you on this  you want to talk about the implications of the
one for the other
mr kohn  i would have an inflation objective not a pricelevel objective  a pricelevel
objective has a lot of attractiveness in terms of planning and pinning things down but if we want to
proceed we ought to proceed in baby steps and i would start with an inflation objective  it
wouldnt be an average over time  we would always be aiming at our objective going forward
without making up for misses one way or another
like president yellen and governor mishkin i continued my answers to the questions after
number 1 with number 4 because that answer influenced the other ones  so i would as you can
imagine be very flexible and not have a fixed time frame  were talking about longterm
effectiveness  it depends on the size and the nature of the shocks hitting the economy how far you
are from your objective how long you want to take to get back the implications for the output gap
of returning through one path or another and other particular circumstances  in addition the
committee over the past fifteen to twenty years has worked very well with what weve called
buying insurance or riskmanagement type of techniques  those techniques imply that you aim
away from the central tendency from time to time because you see that the tails of the distributions
are fatter on one side or another  the cost of missing one way or another is greater  aiming away
from the goal every once in a while at least for a short time promotes stabilization  thats another
reason to be flexible and not have a fixed period  among the circumstances in which that might
arise as governor mishkin noted are times when theres a risk of financial instability like the fall
of 1998
on the index i agree with president minehan that theres no single index and we ought to
be looking at everything to determine what the underlying inflation process is and where its going
in terms of our communication im drawn to the total cpi  its most familiar to the public and
therefore it would perhaps help tie down expectations  theres no reason for a longrun target not
to be comprehensive in a way thats meaningful for longrun planning  the cpi is not revised and
its fully transparent in its construction  we have problems with the nonmarket prices in the pce
they get revised  we dont totally understand and cant replicate how theyre put together in the
pce and that bothers me  the revisions too bother me  the staff made a strong argument that
they shouldnt bother me because its only the implications going forward  but president fisher
crystallized a risk in a speech he made by saying that if we had only known in 2003 what the true
inflation rate was we would have acted differently  im not sure thats true  we were taking
account of a lot of things but i can understand how somebody who wasnt in the system would
think that it was true because of the focus on that particular inflation rate  id rather focus on
something that doesnt get revised so that people cant come back and say well if only you had
known this you would have done that  a lot of secondguessing is going on and id rather take
that revision of the price index off the table as one reason for that
i would do a point with a range around it with emphasis on the point  since theres no fixed
horizon we should be able to define our ultimate goal  by the way i would use core inflation and
the other things as intermediate targets  i wouldnt give up looking at core and everything else but i
would define the goal as total inflation  so then i would have a point  that point should have a
gravitational pull  generally we ought to be moving toward the point though exceptions might
arise if there were financial distress or reasons for moving away  our forecast ought to be pulling
us toward the center of the range  i would put a range around that point to communicate that shocks
happen  we cant be expected to hit the point all the time  ordinarily wed lie within the range and
be tending toward the middle  another thing that a range would do is give a sense of a nonlinear
reaction function  if things got outside the range then we might react even more strongly than we
would inside the range  that would be a useful signal to send as well  so i would say plus or minus
1 percent perhaps
i found the question of the level very difficult  i do worry about the zero bound  the
anxiety is not entirely in the public  it was inside this room in 2003 it was inside me anyhow as i
was voting on policy  in theory there were ways of dealing with this but in practice it wasnt clear
that they would work and i didnt want to test them  so i think the zero bound is an issue  that
concern led me to a cpi of at least 2 percent which i think takes care of most of the zero bound
problems  but we have inflation expectations anchored at 2 now  there is very little gain from
going from 2 to 2 i think  i dont want to count on a credibility bonus in getting there  i dont
think theres any evidence  if we could get that bonus it would be nice but i dont want to count on
it  so i think id go opportunistically maybe from 2 to 2  the transition costs of going from 2 to
2 are real  theyre palpable  they concern unemployment  the longrun gains from going from
2 to 2 are very theoreticalnominal illusions tax system trapezoids in marty feldsteins tax
system these types of things  laughter  i think they are obscure and theoretical  so if i had to
define something id start with 2 now and maybe tell the public that we could move down to 2
later  thats more consistent
where would we go on the decisionmaking  i think we should try to reach a consensus
we ought to have a good discussion  everybody sitting around the table ought to come together
partly because this will last more than a year and so people who arent voting are effectively
becoming bound even if theyre not literally bound  if we cant do that we ought to vote  but i
hope we can reach a consensus  as for how the public should be informed obviously it would be in
the minutes but also in the monetary policy report and testimonies  i dont think we need to
decide that now but i do think we need to decide in terms of informing the public and informing
ourselves  this issue is very complex with lots of ramifications  even if we found the center of
gravity as to what the committee agreed on wed have to think very very carefully about how to
express that and what it implies for policy choices under different circumstances  i view this at
least for this part of the inflation goal as just another step in a long process before the committee
should be comfortable with going public  we need papers that explore these implementation
problems and implications and then we need to agree among ourselves what all of that means
as for the proposed trial for producing a forecast narrative i strongly support that  the
issues that have been pointed out are key  how to express the uncertainty is very very hard  if
someone asked me to express my uncertainty i have no idea how i would do that  i would call
dave and ask him to run the model laughter and he would get the model results  thats exactly
what i would do  but there may be other ways of doing that and i think we need to explore that
issue further
the path for the fed funds rate is a very difficult issue as well  im not quite where president
plosser is about publishing fourthquarter levels  i have some concerns about whether that would be
viewed as a commitment or not  id prefer to let sweden and norway experiment with this a little
longer laughter before the united states joined the full frontal review here  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole has a comment
mr poole  given that i was so frugali think i was frugalin my initial comments id
like to provide some very quick additional comments  the biggest mistakes that central banks have
made historically have been when theyve allowed price stability to slip away and it has had very
very large effects on employment  if you have an intense interest in employment stability you
ought to have an intense interest in price stability and we can point in the history of the federal
reserve to the great depression and the period from 1965 to 1980  i cant guarantee that a price
stability numerical target written into the federal reserve act in 1913 would have avoided those
disasters but i think that it would have made a difference  we could also point to the japanese
experience  if japan had had a clear endorsement in its formal policy of price stability in 1990 a
decade of deflation and stagnation might have been avoided  those really big mistakes are what
worry me and are why i think that we should go in this direction  that point hasnt been made but
to me it is the biggest argument for doing it  the protection of high employment is the reason that
we want price stability
on the pce and the cpi issue the reason that i favor the pceand i could certainly go for
total pceis that the cpi is subject to changes in weights as a consequence of public policy
decisions  the reason that the medical care component of the cpi is only 5 percentand i think its
around 17 percent in the pceis that so many entities besides the consumer pick up medical care
expenses  other parts of the cpi are probably subject to distortion for that reason  i can imagine
public policy in the healthcare area taking two different tacks going forward  one would be a
move toward the single payer system in which you and i would pay our medical expenses through
taxes and not through copays and writing checks to physicians the other would go in the direction
toward health savings accounts and tax incentives in which case much more of the medical care
would come down on households and would show up in changed weights in the consumer price
index  to me that vulnerability of the index and the weights is a powerful argument  thats the
reason that housing is so big a fraction in the cpian unreasonably large fractionbecause other
components are affected the other way  i think that the case in terms of public understanding for the
cpi would have been very strong five years ago  but the federal reserve has been talking about
the pce for quite a long time now  in fact if we were to move toward the cpi it would be
backtracking from the direction that this committee has taken in recent years  so i think the
argument for continuity at this point is really for the pce  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i thought i would just state a few points as sort
of a predicate before diving into the questions  first i probably have a bit of a financial market bias
on this topic and i would begin by saying that the financial markets rightly or wrongly already
believe that we have some form of inflation targeting  so thats in some ways my own jumpingoff
point  ill admit that its soft  its confusing  its a little bit ugly  there is a lot of ambiguity but
the question thats ripe for consideration is what the relative benefits and costs are of establishing a
more crystal clear objective from that point  second as background with respect to the economic
forecasts the financial markets have necessarily been forced to construct their own narratives  in
fact until very recently really until the past year or so theyve not focused a lot on our projections
im quite encouraged that over the past twelve months theyve spent more time and attention on
them  so it strikes me that theres a much clearer case for real net benefits in elevating and
explaining our projections  as a final jumpingoff point i would say that the outcome that weighs
quite heavily in my assessment of this subject is what quadrant we want to avoid  i drew for myself
a simple twobytwo figure  establishing a target and not establishing a target are on the y axis
and success and failure are on the x axis  in some ways our job is to avoid establishing a target and
failing  were trying to avoid that quadrant  that quadrant strikes me as considerably worse than
staying in some ambiguity such as where we are now and over time as i think president poole
rightly warns worried that we might fail  it strikes me as important that there is somewhere to go
and that we still have an out  we can adopt some kind of shock treatment as other countries with
far less credibility have done  so i would say that the basis of my answer to these questions is really
trying to avoid that quadrant
in weighing the relative benefits and costs im more convinced that the benefits are small
than that the costs are small  im really not sure about the costs  for all the discussion that weve
had here and for all thats been written publicly about the inflationtargeting question what is far
more important than our enunciation of an inflation target is the way it works in practice  as to the
points that president stern made about our accountability and credibility we could agree on the
perfect inflation target with the perfect ranges and have that all work perfectly but if we and our
successors dont abide by the rules that we set then all is for naught  it reminds me a bit of the
discussion that occurs in the congress about tax policy  they fight over whether tax policy is
permanent they spend a lot of time debating that back and forth and it is not permanent because
other congresses can immediately undo what they did  so im a bit hesitant to suggest that even
with our best intentions and even with unanimity around this room over time we wouldnt be
sending mixed messages to the marketplace as our preferences change and as our membership
changes
with that let me go to the questions at hand  i would reserve the right not to make a final
judgment on the price stability goal questions until we conclude our thinking to a significantly
greater extent on the economic projections  should we define a numerical objective  ultimately
there may be net benefits to establishing the objective but im not yet convinced as to the gains
maybe even more important i would prefer not to implement any final decision on the numerical
objective until we have made progress and have implemented the economic projections and ive
really tried to focus on not prejudging the latter question  why should those two issues be
separated  i think they should for a couple of reasons  first these projections are going to be
terribly important and if we bundle them with our answer on the inflation target question we would
be stepping on our own message and on our own focus  theres a lot here for the capital markets to
swallow particularly as many people around this room have described what theyre trying to
achieve  i feel as though the projections would become relegated to the back burner in public
discussion if they were placed in tandem with an announcement on the numerical objective
im also worried about the timing of the rollout  its easy for me to say that i would rather
the times to be more benign before we make a decision on the numerical objective  that might be
foolhardy  there may just not be a perfect time in which to take this step but boy id certainly be
more comfortable if we announced an inflation target with which we were at that very moment
broadly consistent  to the extent that were not in my own thinking about credibility and
accountability i would in answer to the rest of the questions let my numbers be a little higher and
my timing be a little more robust  my vital sense in combining these two questions is that slow and
steady will win this race and that it would be hard to walk back from a numerical objective if were
unable to accomplish it properly whereas i think we have only gains to be made from taking this in
stages
regarding the question of whether it should be a point or a range my answer is perhaps too
practical  i think the rangesfor example those that weve given on economic projectionshave
been broadly misinterpreted by the markets  if we look at the monetary policy testimonies and lets
just say for purposes of exposition that each of our forecasts in the central tendency is between 2
and 3 percent that range gets reported and i think it is understood as the fomcs belief that the
economy will grow between 2 and 3 percent next year which is quite different from the statements
that weve made  that is we all have different uncertainty bands around our projections but the
range even in the context of a numerical objective is harder to explain  my preference would be if
we were to go down that path to establish a point and suggest that there could be variance around it
most of the time  in that way misses could be frequent and the judgments that we made would be
perceived to be less mechanical and less formulaic
with respect to the time horizon certainly these words would be discussed in association
with one another  the language with which i would be most comfortable would be that the goal
should be generally achieved in the long term in a manner consistent with the dual mandate  a
flexible horizon is more useful for us to demonstrate consistency with previous fed actions  its
more consistent with our focus on evolution and is more suggestive that were not somehow
crossing the rubicon here  this is really what we have long done and were simply taking a next
logical step  i dont feel strongly about the question of the price index  obviously as governor
kohn suggested the more long term the focus is the less the index matters
in terms of the group versus individual dynamics i find it hard not to argue that a consensus
view is far preferable  i would point out one consequence of the other way  if the judgments end
up being too diffuse too individualistic we might actually get some negative value on our
communication with the financial markets  my sense is that unanimous is great close to unanimous
is pretty good and if we get much below a strong strong majority i am worried about mixed
messages as this policy gets rolled out
in terms of the projections on which i dont think weve spent a ton of time in todays
discussionnor was that its purposei just reiterate that most of our judgments here are forward
looking  most of our determinations on policy are data dependent  by focusing on the projections
as a first step i think we can put the markets broadly defined in better recognition of what that
means  i support the trial run in may  i suppose that the confidentiality around that dry run is
essential to making it successful  if word of that dry run found its way into a broader constituency i
think wed very quickly find ourselves having to make decisions before being ready to do so  what
ive seen of the narrative from the staff i thought was very good but i still am troubled about
whether we can describe our uncertainty in a sufficiently robust way  i thought that was a very
good swing at it but i reserve the right to revisit that note so that it conveys our sense of uncertainty
without sounding too obscure  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i have two introductory comments  one
thanks to the staffthat was a great job as others have said  second mr chairman i am assuming
that youre going to seek a consensus of the participants on this not just of the voting members
chairman bernanke  yes
mr moskow  i guess i have the advantage or maybe the disadvantage of going near the
end  i think hearing the discussion is an advantage though  im reminded of the famous term that
alan greenspan usedconundrumand i view this as a kind of conundrum  we have the dual
mandate in our legislation of price stability and maximum employment or maximum output but in
our heart of hearts we believe that we really can influence only one of those in the long termthe
price stability objective  we also believe that influencing that objective helps us achieve the longer
term objective of maximum employment or maximum output as well  so if we set firm quantitative
guidelines for price stabilityand ill define firm laterwere then going to be pushed inevitably
to have some type of quantitative guidelines for output  that consideration leads you to the position
of well lets not set too firm a quantitative target for price stability  lets make it looser  lets
make it flexible  theres a sense of that from at least some people who have spoken here today
but then of course the looser you make it the more flexible the more the claimed benefits
decrease as a result  you have less of an anchor to inflation  you have less accountability and
discipline  you have less transparency and less facilitation of internal and external
communications which are the claimed benefits of it
so i just want to say that i clearly favor policies consistent with low and stable inflation and
i think weve done a pretty good job of it so far if you look back at the volcker years the greenspan
years and the bernanke years  im still not convinced that we should have a quantitative goal for
inflation at this time  its a huge decision  it sets us down a road that i think you just cant reverse
i dont see the overriding reason for it as ive listened to this discussion  ive heard phrases such as
its difficult to quantify the benefits the benefits are not enormous the benefits are small
its a close call  some people at least believe its a close call and if policy is working well now
why do it  i think it is risky  tom talked about the unintended consequences  kevin referred to
avoiding that corner of his grid which i agree with completely  so i would proceed very cautiously
on this
i too started at question 4 because given our dual mandate i think the time frame is in a
sense more important than the target  someone said that we need to specify a time horizon to be
held accountable and i agree with that statement  but then whats the accountability for the other
part of our dual mandate  wouldnt someone say that its appropriate that we be held accountable
for the other part of our dual mandate  this thought brings me back to the conundrum i mentioned
before  a twoyear time frame inevitably raises the issue about the dual mandate and that short a
time frame doesnt give proper respect to the dual mandate either  im not comfortable using the
medium term which other central banks have used  i think that over the business cycle is better  i
prefer to have no time frame or id be comfortable with the terminology that kevin had which
would work in that direction as well
getting back to some of the particular points what index would i prefer  ive talked
publicly about a comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent core pce but a long time frame says lets go to the
overall measure because the overall and the core should be the same over time  so i would shift to
the overall measure it is more understandable  i can see arguments for the pce or the cpi  i think
thats a secondorder question that we can talk about once we decide whether to go overall or core
whether to take a point goal or a rangeagain going to a long time frame pushes me toward a
point not toward a range  someone threw out a range of 1 to 3 percent or a range around that  i get
nervous when we have a wider range because it gets into the consideration of whether it is a zone of
indifference  are we indifferent at any point within that range  if someone said lets have a
point and then wed have brackets around it and that would give people the idea that were more
comfortable with its being within those brackets  but then if theres a shock and we go outside the
bracketslets arbitrarily say 2 percent and the brackets are 1 to 3 and then it gets up to 31are
people going to assume automatically that we will respond more immediately to that shock than if it
were 29  i think thats the type of situation you get into  so i would just stick with the point  i
dont see the benefit of going to the brackets  i am also nervous about starting with a high number
to me 2 percent is a high number  i think that number would appear to the outside world as
opportunistic and as a very high number for this central bank to be setting for its longterm
objective  so i would prefer a number below 2 percent
the time frame ive already talked about  on the consensus we dont want to change the
number once we set it  but we have a governance procedure and i think this would be an important
governance issue  wed be operating in the absence of a legislative mandate and we have turnover
among governors and presidents and some pretty soon  laughter  this would probably require an
annual reaffirming of the decision  i think youd have to do it given the turnover that would occur
i think it should be a consensus of all participants not just the voting members  on the survey
question i smiled when rick withdrew his suggestion which he made last october about having a
survey  the reason i smiled is that i read the transcript and its absolutely amazing  more than half
the people agreed with the suggestion that you withdrew  so rick i just want to say that you have
enormous influence over this committee laughter but i agree it should be dropped
mr mishkin  thank you  laughter
mr moskow  today  laughter  on the experiment it is worthwhile i think that we
should proceed with it  it will provide us with more useful information  we have some specific
suggestions on the details of it but we can give those later
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  since lunch is looming ill try to be as brief as possible
the key to what i hope we will be trying to achieve is better credibility to make monetary policy
more effective and to fulfill our dual mandate better  i very much agree with president pooles
comments that its valuable to make sure that we have some insurance against mistakes  it actually
fits well into the riskmanagement framework that governor kohn had articulated  thats what i
see as potentially valuable about this  i do think that there is value along the lines that president
stern discussed in terms of internal and external accountability and articulation  but it has to be
seen in the context of a broader riskmanagement policy that helps us to fulfill the dual mandate
thats why i would support moving in this direction although im also one of the people who see
that its somewhat of a close call  one can make a good argument that there is value in the
insurance but it is hard to quantify these things
with respect to the particular price index supposedly people have more familiarity with
headline cpi than with core measures or with the pce  im not sure in the real world that people
know much about the differences among the various inflation measures  we talk about headline
cpi  they look at the headlines about inflation and i dont think that the distinctions between core
and cpi and pce are well known  but part of this is uncertainty on my part  i dont understand the
exact nature of the expectations process or how expectations affect behavior  ultimately what i
want to do is enhance our credibility so that we can make monetary policy more effective  i lean
toward core pce because it seems to be a bit better correlated with the future paths of inflation
although in the long run theyre all very highly correlated  core pce seems to be a bit better
behaved  with this credibility approach and also with what affects behavior and expectations my
concern is that the more we deviate from our stated objective either temporarily or for the long run
the less that objective is taken seriously  the more times the chairman has to go to the congress
and say well you know our objective is 2 but we have special circumstances here and this
transitory part there that seems to be at odds with getting to our objective of enhancing credibility
now i may be wrong  it may be that if people are really familiar with cpi then thats the thing to
focus on  im just not convinced of that because i think we know very little about peoples
expectations the development process and their behavior process  i think its more just general
credibilitythat its clear the fed has tried to ensure that inflation doesnt stray out of a particular
range or away from a particular point  thats the message and that we achieve it  i think thats the
best way for us to achieve the dual mandate
on the third question whether a point or a range my answer is no  i want something in
between much the same as what president stern articulatedperhaps something like no more than
2 percent but not much below 2 percent something like what the european central bank does
because it is better not to have a range for the reason that many people have said but it is also nice to
have a little flexibility  this specification doesnt explicitly articulate the range but it gives us
flexibility and keeps us away from the zero point  i dont see a lot of welfare benefits with going
much below that and i dont see a lot of welfare benefits in moving dramatically from where we are
now which is not the best situation but is by no means a terrible situation
with respect to the horizon more flexibility is better  this fits in with the riskmanagement
approach  if push comes to shove if i had to say a number id say something like three years plus
or minus a year  but i think it would be better just to say over an intermediate term or a long run or
a business cycle or some other term that gives us flexibility to respond to shocks  i like president
pianaltos approach to set it and forget it  unfortunately in practice that will be difficult because of
turnover of the committee  if a goal is changed each year or is not reaffirmed each year the whole
enterprise is undermined  so we have to make sure that if we do articulate a goal we feel pretty
comfortable that members of the fomc at least into the foreseeable future would be comfortable
with that goal otherwise the whole purpose of having the goal is undermined  with respect to the
trial run for producing a forecast i think thats very valuable to do  i think well learn a lot by
actually doing it to see what we feel comfortable or uncomfortable with regarding uncertainty
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin you had a twohander
mr mishkin  yes  actually its an issue concerning some information that perhaps
karen can provide for us  the ecb has used less than 2 percent but close and in a way i find
that very attractive  but i do worry  i know the academics have been quite critical of that
articulation of a target as being a little waffley  i dont know if thats really accurate or not  karen
do you have any feel for what the reaction has been  maybe people in general have been a bit
concerned about the ecbs communication strategy  it may have to do more with the secondpillar
issue  but has there been any problem in this regard
ms johnson  well it is complex  i would say yes  there are three things  first
people find the statement rube goldbergish  it just seems odd to say that it is less than 2 percent
but close somehow right  if you mean 19 percent why dont you say 19  certainly criticism is
directed there especially  second the fact is that the ecb hasnt achieved it  on this back page if
you look at their 2 percent line youll see that very seldom do they ever achieve it  that hasnt
helped the communication piece  third in general the ecb had communication problems  i cant
sort out those three but i would say that my sense is that most people still see expressing it that way
as a weak point
chairman bernanke  initially they began with below 2 percent and they clarified
below but not too far below then that created at least a sense of a floor
mr mishkin  an issue that arose for the ecb too in this regard is that they had a whole
big reviewsimilar to the one were doingand then they came up with something that was
considered rube goldbergish
ms johnson  the policy people endorsed it even though all the papers that they had
prepared for the conference didnt
mr mishkin  it just is a concern that we want to learn from other peoples experiences
and on this particular issue there has been some experience that has not always been favorable
even though in one sense i actually liked that approach and thought about it i was a little concerned
about exactly the issues that karen has mentioned  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  this is sort of obvious but the further out you go the more uncertainty
there is about the purchasing power of the euro  what would you tell someone to assume for twenty
years worth of euro inflation  if you cant give them a number thats intensifying the uncertainty
in a seemingly needless way
ms johnson  i guess they would think that they had put on a ceiling and that it answers
that question at least as well as any other statement that has a number attached because they have a
ceiling  the fact that they have not hit it is a different question but they put it in place
mr kohn  a little information here  a chart in the right side of the blue folder from
karen shows that in consensus economics expectations for ten years out inflation has been pretty
firmly anchored at about 19 for the past three years
mr mishkin  for the euro
mr kohn   for the euro area without any real fluctuation  in fact there is less
fluctuation there than in the uk consensus economics and about the same fluctuation in their ten
year swap rate as in the united kingdom
mr lacker  thats great  im not surprised that there is some mean to the financial
markets estimate of longrun inflation there  thats consistent with the ecbs view about how
they conduct policyi mean this is more of an optics and communication issue  if thats how
theyre conducting policy why not say 19
chairman bernanke  vice chairman you have the floor absolutely  laughter
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i think three things about our
current regime are worth reflecting on as to whether we can improve them  they are first the lack
of clarity that exists about how we define our objective second the relative lack of texture that we
provide about the outlook and the risks that underpin our decisions relative to some other central
banks and third the way we run our internal conversation  in all these areas because institutions
are subject to inertia were probably short of the frontier of the achievable but i think its worth
thinking about whether we can get closer to the frontier  i just want to raise some questions that i
think are the hardest for us to work through in figuring out how we should evolveand i think we
should evolve
the first issue is about the balance between the benefits of the regime and the costs  the
problem we face is that based on what we know about the theory and the experience the gains on
expectations relative to what we have already achieved as a central bank look pretty small  i think
theres a broad consensus that theyre small  theres a greater dispersion of views about what the
costs are  some of them are transition costshow you get where youre going and the political
issues that surround that  some of the costs are more uncertainty about the effect on how you
operate going forward  the difficulty in judging the balance between what we think we know about
the potential gains and those costs is that its hard to narrow uncertainty around the costs even after
looking at the experience of other central banks  as many people have said the experience of other
central banks is pretty reassuring as to the costs  its hard to argue that they are worse off because
they have achieved this in terms of outcomes  but some of that uncertainty is difficult to narrow ex
ante and a lot of it will depend on judgments that we make about the design of the regime  but
even those judgments wont fully answer the questions because even if we tied them down now
they would still leave some uncertainty about the effect on our incentives our behavior and our
management of a regime that will have much more exacting demands on communication
this problem is magnified by the fact that it is hard for us to adopt a regime with an explicit
fixed relatively short horizon and to justify it as consistent not only with the dual mandate and the
politics that surround that but alsobased on what we know about the experience of other central
bankswith making sensible decisions about monetary policy that has multiple objectives over
time  i dont think that outcome is realistic for us as a committee  therefore youre talking about
a range of options that are much toward the softer endno fixed horizon a horizon that varies
according to the circumstances  the gains are going to look more tenuous thats one issue that i
think is interesting for us to think through
the second issue concerns the initial conditions and the transition costs  if youre going to
adopt an objective thats different from what people think your objective is and different from what
best estimates of trend core inflation or trend inflation are today those conditions and costs are very
complicated  the dialogue between rick and jeff was very interesting  both choices that exist
today if we were going to launch today look very unattractive  you can basically decide that you
will pick a target thats pretty close to what your judgment is about trend because that is slightly
above what the market infers our objective is  to validate a higher objective than what they have
been inferring is awkward and hard to see  it would be easy to say that youre going to adopt an
objective substantially lower than that and believe that it would be easy for us to make it a simple
compelling political endeavor to achieve  so i think that issues about timing initial conditions and
transition costs are very important and complicated to work through  but i thought you did a nice
job of laying out the obvious issues on both sides
the third issue that i think is interesting is the question about the strength of the consensus
necessary to go forward and how you deal with it  i think youd need a very strong consensus to go
forward  some would view this change in regime by the fed as the most significant since
humphreyhawkins maybe since well before humphreyhawkins and so youd want to have a
very strong consensus  when you decide on the strength of that consensus you had better move
forward  you have to have agreement  people have to agree that theyre going to operate under
that regime and i think we will in effect need to bind our successors to operate within that regime
even if you have a regime in which because of the legal or practical circumstances surrounding the
institution you have to have a periodic reaffirmation of that objective in effect youre binding our
successors because we all agree that once you do this you cant go back  we cant contemplate the
possibility that were going to adjust it in response to the changing preferences of different
committees over time
the fourth issue that i think is interesting for us is that we have to design a process of
internal deliberation before launch that allows us to get more comfortable with the way we would
operate  the aspects of our internal decisionmaking process that are least well suited to operating
comfortably in any of the variants of the regime that weve been discussing are the lack of clarity
that we live with about what our individual preferences are about how that informs our different
views about the structure about how we inform our choices about appropriate desirable paths for
inflation and about what monetary policy we think is consistent with that  as weve been
discussing we need to bring a little more internal clarity to that conversation  we need to know
why were disagreeing when we disagree if were going to be better at thinking through difficult
choices  there is also the related gap in how we talk about this stuff today as don kohn said
even if you only talk about a regime toward which you may be leaning or publicly disclose things
about your forecast or move in the direction of a quantitative definition of inflation were going to
have to have a more explicit conversation about what we think is the appropriate path or slope of the
path  even if we dont want to adopt a fixed horizon that varies over time and have that embedded
in what we disclose about our forecast were going to have to have more explicit conversations
about what we think is an adequate acceptable path toward trend  that is a complicated
conversation to have and in my brief experience on the committee we havent spent much time
thinking about those kinds of choices  wed prefer to live with squishiness lack of definition and
ambiguity around those kinds of things because it is easier  i dont think wed have that option in a
regime in which were moving toward morefrequent disclosure threeyear forecasts and a central
tendency of a path for these kinds of things  so my fourth issue is that we need to be careful in
thinking through how were going to get comfortable with the evolution in our internal regime thats
going to be necessary to live within these kinds of regimes before we launch
my last point isim not sure how to describe thisabout the stability in any proposal we
adopt  were all going to be tempted to soften the edges of what were agreeing on to make the
consensus as broad as possible  we need to be careful that if we adopt the intermediate things we
look at them and think they will stand up pretty well to external criticism and that were not going to
find ourselves uncomfortable with having moved to that intermediate position  i think were going
to get pulled naturally further toward more clarity  the discussion about the pastfor example
whether we reveal the conditioning assumptions of our forecastis the best example of that  thats
one instance in which you might decide that its expedient to agree today that were going to have
an unstated undisclosed appropriate policy conditioning assumption for a forecast that has more
clarity  but over time as weve seen in other cases theres going to be a lot of pressure to say but
what does this tell us really  we dont really understand this  so we want to think through this
question about how to do something that is going to look stable over time  it doesnt mean we have
to fix it and say we would never evolve beyond that  but if we know were going to adopt
something thats going to be unstable and subject to pressure to move lets try to think through a bit
in advance how wed anticipate that pressure and respond to it  we can make the same point about
the importance of thinking through the sequence of any evolution  i take ricks point about the
importance of being evolutionary in that respect  just as an example if we decide that we want to
go first with the transparency around our forecast before consensus or clarity on a quantitative
objective as publicly announced we should be sure that we think thats an optimal chain of
decisions too  so the questions about sequence are going to be important to work through  i have a
bunch of comments on the initial proposal for a narrative description of our forecast and the way
uncertainty is captured  but if the chairman permits i will submit those directly to the staff for the
record
chairman bernanke  certainly  thank you very much  let me thank the
committee for yet another very thoughtful and helpful discussion  i appreciate the time youve
spent preparing for this  thanks also to the staff  i thought the background materials were
excellent  im not going to say much  im just going to make a couple of comments  if we do
adopt an objective it needs to be consistent with the dual mandate  thats obvious and means a
couple of things  one is that the longrun inflation rate would have to take into account among
other things the zero bound  i think that is an issue  i would not be comfortable with a range that
involves having the inflation rate say below 1 percent a significant amount of the time
stochastically speaking  so i think thats a consideration  second because we have a dual mandate
and because its an implication of optimal monetary policy the horizon has to be quite flexible  is
that meaningless  i dont think so  in particular if we begin to use the projections more actively
the projections would give a good bit of guidance to the public about the time it takes to get back to
the target range  in particular we could also through our communications discuss how the
adjustment period depends on initial conditions the state of the economy and so on
im flexible on the choice of index  i heard a lot of interesting discussion today  i am
somewhat attracted to the headline cpi  i do think that people understand it more  it appears in
labor contracts for example and in other wage discussions  it obviously appears in the tips and
other places  so i think its worth considering  one possibility choosing a headline cpi around
2 percent would be reasonably consistent with a 1 to 2 percent core pce in a sense because of the
measurement difference  but thats an open question  i think it remains to be discussed  we have a
lot to digest here and were going to be thinking very hard about all the comments we heard today
the subcommittee i know will try to come up with some  don i hope by tomorrow youll have a
fewlaughter  again this has been very useful
id like to just make one comment on the projections which again i think are potentially
very valuable  this is about the assumption of appropriate monetary policy  the way thats
interpreted now is that each person chooses his or her own path for appropriate monetary policy
and i think that sometimes leads to somewhat confusing outcomes  if you have someone for
example who is pessimistic about where inflation will actually go but who has a low inflation target
and therefore has an appropriate monetary policy thats much more aggressive than everyone else
he or she will report a good inflation outcome and the press will report an optimistic fed as far as
where inflation is going to go  i would just like to put that out for consideration since were going
to do several dry runs  by the way i dont anticipate that we will be doing this live for the july
monetary policy report  this will take a while so dont worry about that  one alternative which i
believe i mentioned before would be for us to make an unconditional forecast by which i mean
that we would essentially be saying well what do we think the committee is going to do and
conditional on that what we would expect the economy to deliver  that i think would probably be
easier for the public to understand than the way we do it now with each person having his or her
own conditioning policy assumptions  but i leave that for further discussion and for the staff also to
think about
if there are no other comments again thank you  we will have lunch in the anteroom and
the next meeting will be may 9  we are adjourned
end of meeting
