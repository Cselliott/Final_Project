all right  we turn now to the business of the meeting  let me call on bill dudley to give us
the desk report
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the handout that you should have in front of you  over the past month term funding pressures for banks have generally subsided  but the bigger story remains the continued pressure on bank balance sheets the tightening of credit availability and the impact of this tightening on the outlook for economic activity  the travails of the monoline financial guarantorssome of which have already been downgraded by one or more of the rating agencieshave exacerbated the worries about the potential for further bank writedowns and have created risks that some financial instruments that rely on monoline guarantees might no longer be viable  at this juncture whether the major monoline guarantors will receive the new capital needed to keep or restore their aaa ratings remains uncertain
ill start today by noting that us and global equity and fixedincome markets have behaved in a way consistent with a darker economic outlook  as shown in exhibit 1 the major us indexes have fallen sharply since the december 11 fomc meeting  these declines in the stock markets have been mostly matched abroad as shown in exhibit 2  at the same time corporate credit spreads have risen in tandem with the equity markets decline  as shown in exhibit 3 highyield corporate bond spreads are up more than 100 basis points since the december fomc meeting pulling the interest rates on highyield debt significantly higher  investmentgrade spreads have also widened  but for investmentgrade debt the decline in treasury yields has been larger than the rise in spreads lowering somewhat the absolute level of yields  global credit default swap spreads have also increased sharply as shown in

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
exhibit 4  market price risk has increased  this is most visible in the rise of most market measures of implied volatility  for example the vix which measures implied volatility on the sp 500 index recently climbed back to the peak level reached in august exhibit 5 and the move index which measures volatility in the treasury coupon market has climbed to its highest level since 1998
the problems of the financial guarantors have been an important part of the story
in recent years the major financial guarantors have diversified into insuring structuredfinance products including collateralized debt obligations cdos currently their exposure to all structuredfinance products is about 780 billion exhibit 6 shows the distribution of exposure across three buckets  us public finance us abs and structured finance and the total nonus exposure for the six major monoline guarantors  because the structuredfinance guarantees have typically been issued against the highest rated tranches at the very top of the capital structure until recently the rating agencies did not think that these guarantees would result in meaningful losses  however as the housing outlook has continued to deteriorate and the rating agencies have increased their loss estimates on subprime and other types of residential mortgage loan products the risk of significant losses has increased sharply  this is particularly the case with respect to these firms collateralized debt obligation exposuresa portion of their total structuredfinance exposure  as i discussed in an earlier briefing given the highly nonlinear payoffs built into these products modest changes in the loss assumptions on the underlying collateral can lead to a sharp rise in expected losses on super senior aaarated collateralized debt obligations  unfortunately the cdo exposures of several of these financial guarantors are quite large relative to their claimspaying resources  as shown in exhibit 7 statutory capital for even the biggest firm is less than 7 billion the total capital for the entire group is slightly more than 20 billion and total claimspaying resources for this group from all sources is about 50 billion  exhibit 8 compares these claimspaying resources with the subset of cdo exposures that contain some subprime mortgagerelated collateral  for four of the six major guarantors these cdo exposures represent more than 200 percent of their total claimspaying resources  these exposures and the uncertainty about how these exposures will actually translate into losses are the proximate cause for the collapse in the financial guarantor share prices and the widening in their credit default swap spreads  this is why new sources of capital have been either prohibitively expensive or dilutive or both to existing shareholders

as i noted in last weeks briefing credit rating downgrades of the financial guarantors would likely lead to significant marktomarket losses for those financial institutions that had purchased protection  for example in its fourthquarter earnings release merrill lynch wrote down by 31 billion its valuation related to its hedges with the financial guarantors 26 billion of this reflected writedowns related to super senior abs cdo exposures  unfortunately there is not much transparency as to the counterparty exposures of the guarantors on a firmbyfirm assetclassbyassetclass or securitybysecurity basis  however major brokerdealers have considerable non abs cdo exposures to the financial guarantors  for example they are thought to
have hedged an even larger amount of the super senior tranches of synthetic corporate cdos with the financial guarantors  this suggests the potential for significant additional marktomarket losses for commercial and investment bank counterparties should the financial guarantor credit ratings get further downgraded  in addition such downgrades would increase market anxiety about counterparty risk because there would be considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and incidence of the prospective losses such downgrades might trigger  financial institutions are also exposed to the monoline guarantors via the wraps these guarantors have issued on certain money market securities including auction rate securities tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes the amount of these securities outstanding is significant  the total market size for these three types of securities is estimated to be about 900 billion  the major risk here is that the loss of the aaarated guarantee from the financial guarantor could undercut the demand for these securities  in the case of tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes this could trigger the liquidity backstops provided by major commercial banks and dealers leading to further demands on their balance sheets
in the case of the auction rate securities market the dealers would be faced with a difficult hobsons choice  they could either allow the auction to fail or take the securities onto their books to prevent a failed auction  in the case of a failed auction the investor receives a higher interest rate but has to wait until the next auction to try to redeem the securities  if failed auctions were to persist as would be likely then the securities would essentially become longterm rather than shortterm obligations failed auctions would undoubtedly distress clients that had purchased the securities on the assumption that they would be liquid and could be redeemed easily  failed auctions would also likely lead to broader distress in the associated municipal and student loan securities markets  we have already experienced a number of failed auctions for auction rate securities  moreover the recent downgrades of ambac and fsa have led to significant market differentiation among tender option bonds and some upward pressure on municipal bonds wrapped by weaker monoline financial guarantors  if the monoline guarantors are unable to find additional equity or other forms of support these pressures are likely to intensify in coming weeks
the travails of the financial guarantors have added to the pressure on major commercial and investment banks  as shown in exhibits 9 and 10 commercial and investment bank equity prices and credit default swap spreads have generally continued to widen  the cumulative writedowns reported for a selected group of large banks has now reached 100 billion over the past two quarters exhibit 11
coupled with balance sheet growth and other factors such as acquisitions these writedowns have put significant downward pressure on bank capital ratios  for example although all of the top five us commercial banks can still be characterized as well capitalized there has been significant erosion of their capital ratios over the past two quarters exhibit 12  this balance sheet pressure helps to explain why commercial bank counterparties continue to complain about their access to credit the tightening in lending standards and the wider spreads for assets such as jumbo
residential mortgages commercial mortgages and leveraged loans that can no longer be readily securitized and distributed into the capital markets
shifting now to what market participants expect from us from this meeting monetary policy expectations continue to shift in the direction of more cuts that are delivered more quickly  as shown in exhibit 13 the federal funds rate futures market currently implies that market participants now expect additional rate cuts totaling about 100 basis points by midyear  further out as shown in exhibit 14 the eurodollar futures curves indicate that about another 25 basis points is anticipated during the second half of the year  but these expectations are volatile and have been shifting considerably day to day  the primary dealer survey tells a similar story  the modal forecast of the primary dealers shows a federal funds rate trough slightly below
25 percent exhibit 15  compared with the previous dealers survey conducted for the december fomc meeting exhibit 16 the trough has moved down about 75 basis points  as of last friday seventeen of the twenty primary dealers expected a 50 basis point rate cut at this meeting  this sentiment appears to be generally shared by market participants  as shown in exhibit 17 as of last friday options on federal funds rate futures implied a rate cut at todays meeting with the highest probability on a 50 basis point rate cut to 3 percent  however it is important to recognize that the probabilities shown in exhibit 17 put a zero weight on the notion of another intermeeting cut in februaryso they should not be taken literally as to the outcome at todays meeting  the distribution of yields on eurodollar futures 300 days ahead suggests that there has been a regime shift since the december fomc meeting  as shown in exhibit 18 not only have expectations shifted down sharply but the skew has reversed direction  the mode of the distribution is at 175 percent and the skew of the distribution around that mode is toward less extreme rate outcomes  this could be viewed as market participants now pricing in considerable risk of a severe recession but maintaining some hope that a milder downturn might occur or that a recession could possibly be averted altogether
as shown in exhibit 19 the intermeeting rate cut was accompanied by a rise in inflation compensation at the fiveyear to tenyear time horizon  however it is unclear that this represents a genuine deterioration in inflation expectations for several reasons  first the rise occurred in part because breakeven inflation at the fiveyear horizon has fallen as nominal fiveyear treasury yields have dropped sharply  it is this decline that has lifted the fiveyear fiveyearforward measure  i would agree with the memo by board staff that was distributed to the fomc yesterday on this issue  the rise in fiveyear fiveyearforward inflation compensation likely reflects a greater liquidity premium for nominal treasuries  the rise in interest rate volatility is also a factor  according to tips traders the rise in fiveyear fiveyearforward inflation reflects technical factors such as a temporary increase in the demand for shorterdated treasuries monthend index extension flows and a greater liquidity premium for nominal ontherun treasuries  the general rise in interest rate volatility is probably also a factor  second the rise in fiveyear fiveyearforward expectations has not been accompanied by a broad set of other signals consistent with deteriorating longterm inflation expectations  for
example the four to fiveyearforward breakeven inflation measure shows a much smaller rise the dollar has been relatively stable and estimates of bond term risk premiums remain low  on the other side gold prices have increased sharply in the past week  third in our primary dealers survey there was very little change in long term inflation expectations  finally it is worth noting that following the 50 basis point rate cut in september which was more aggressive than expected the fiveyear fiveyearforward rate also rose but the rise proved temporary
i would also like to briefly discuss the state of play in bank term funding marketssome good news  as shown in exhibit 20 the spreads between the one month libor and the onemonth ois rate and the threemonth libor and the three month ois rate have fallen sharply since yearend  however over the past week there has been considerable volatility in these spreads  this could be due to a variety of factorsincluding a temporary increase in the demand by societ gnrale for term funds and the sharp shift in expectations about the nearterm federal funds rate path  currently these spreads are close to the narrowest we have seen since the market turmoil began last august  although the passage of yearend was the predominant factor behind the decline in term funding spreads the term auction facility taf also appears to have been helpful  exhibit 21 shows the results for the first three us auctions  completing the exhibit the results for the fourth auction which was conducted yesterday were minimum bid rate 310 percent stopout rate
312 percent propositions 375 billion bidtocover ratio 125 and number of bidders 52  in general the pattern is one of declining bidtocover ratios and a declining spread between the stopout rate and the overnight index swap rate  the results for the ecb and swiss national bank auctions show a similar pattern  at the latest auction the ecb had 124 billion of bids a bidtocover ratio of 124 and their number of bidders fell to 19 from 22 at the previous auction  the board of governors has said that on february 1 it will announce plans for the taf in february the staff has recommended to the chairman that the auctions continue on a biweekly basis that the size be maintained at 30 billion per auction and that the minimum bid size be cut to 5 million from 10 million to make it easier for smaller institutions to participate
finally there was no foreign currency intervention activity during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the december 11 fomc meeting  of course as always i am happy to take any questions
chairman bernanke  thank you bill  are there questions  president poole
mr poole  bill could you talk about the role of foreign banking organizations  what
fraction roughly are they responsible for
mr dudley  we have been very cautious about talking about the role of the foreign
banks but theyre definitely a significant factor  the best way to look at it is just to look at the new
york district which is taking an overwhelming share of not all but most of these auctions and most
of that is foreign  regarding the participation in terms of number of bidders the split is more even
between domestic and foreign in terms of the actual takedown of dollars it does skew a bit to the
foreign side but it has been variable  it is not the same in each auction
mr poole  if i may make a comment about thati think everyone is aware of my view
that the taf does not change the marginal conditions  its entirely an inframarginal operation
what it does is to save banks the spread between what their cost of funds otherwise would be and
what they get at the taf  so it increases bank earnings by that amount  it seems to me that there is
potentially some reputational risk to the federal reserve in the long run if a significant share of the
benefit is going to foreign banking organizations  i guess one question that i would pose is if we
think that this information would be terribly sensitive to release shouldnt we be careful about
whether we continue if the foreign banking organizations are taking a very large fraction
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  yes i have a couple of questions  i want to start with the issue about
foreign banks though  why are we sensitive about talking about foreign banksi mean is this a
public stance or is this in the committee  the information about the identity of the winning
bidders was sent to every reserve bank
mr dudley  i dont think were particularly sensitive but i think other central banks
would be very sensitive
mr lacker  well these are confidential proceedingsthis is a consequential policy
matter
chairman bernanke  brian
mr madigan  mr chairman if i could  i think president lacker just one point is that
the detailed information on the bidders was sent only to those reserve bank presidents and board
members who specifically asked for it so it was not distributed unilaterally
mr lacker  just the winning bidders
mr madigan  yes  well the spreadsheet of bidders
mr lacker  i thought that every bank all the discount officers received the identity of
the winning bidders and the other information about all the bids went only to those who requested
it
mr madigan  that is correct yes  the second point i would make is that i do not think
there is particular sensitivity about foreign banks but instead sensitivity about taking any chance of
identifying who the bidders are at all because of the great concern about avoiding stigma from the
taf
mr lacker  i wanted to ask a couple of questions about the term auction facility  first
id like to hear more from you about what your understanding is of the effects the term auction
facility had on the funding market  the first question under that would be to your knowledge
were these completely sterilized or just partially sterilized  another question would be for the
recipients were these additional funds that they wouldnt have otherwise borrowed or did they
displace some other borrowing  the next question would be this crowded out something and if it
didnt change materially the total amount of reserves in the system some lending ought to be shifted
from the recipients to someone elseso what do we know about other spillover effects in the
markets  the focus of our attention probably for data reasons was the libor market but there
was also discussion in december of the term fed funds market  what do we know about the
behavior of that since then  id be interested in your sense of whether bidders were riskier than
nonbidders and whether riskier institutions bid more than nonrisky institutions  weve done a bit of
empirical analysisits preliminarybut id be interested in your folks sense of that  about the
foreign institutions im interested in learning about what the advantage was of our lending dollar
balances via this mechanism to foreign banks versus the alternative of having them borrow dollar
balances from their central bank perhaps funded by a swap or out of the foreign central banks own
dollar balances  finallyand this is sort of the most important questionhow should we evaluate
whether this has been a success or not  to what sort of objective evidence should we look to decide
whether we achieved our objectives  related to that can a case be made for ending this facility
soon in light of the fact that the liborois spread is now half of what it was in september when
we decided that it had come down enough to shelve the plan
mr dudley  those are a lot of questions  laughter  okay ill take the easy one first
the taf is completely sterilized  for every dollar that goes into the taf we drain reserves and
weve been doing that mainly by redeeming maturing treasury bills  regarding whether these are
additional funds to those entities it is hard to know what they would have done if the taf facilities
hadnt been available  this may have funded some assets on their balance sheets that they
otherwise would have decided not to fund  i think it is very difficult to know what that
counterfactual is  it is hard to believe that in the system as a whole it led to a lot of additional
funding  i would be surprised by that especially given that we did sterilize reserves and didnt
allow expansion of the balance sheet  in terms of the issue of crowding out the way i think about
the taf is changing the composition of our balance sheet and changing the composition of the
banking systems balance sheet  its not crowding out  we are basically supplying treasury
securities by redeeming bills and then the treasury issues more bills that the markets want and we
are essentially absorbing collateral from the marketplace thats hard for them to finance elsewhere
so it is a change in the composition of the balance sheet  thats how i would think of the way it
works
in terms of how we should evaluate the success we dont know how much was the year
end  we dont know how much was monetary policy easing  but market participants view the
taf as very positive  i think that if we were to discontinue it abruptly they would be unhappy
theres no evidence to suggest that the taf has caused any great harm  it looks as though the
benefits to my mind are likely to significantly exceed the costs even though we cant measure
those benefits very accurately  regarding the foreign institutions issuethe choice between dollar
balances from us versus dollar balances from foreign central banksi think it was a little more
complicated than that because if i remember how we got to the foreign exchange swaps they were
essentially more or less conditional on our doing the taf  they were willing to do the swaps if
they could get the auctions in tandem with our term auction facilities  so my judgment would be
that we probably didnt really have a choice of getting the dollars to those foreign banks through the
ecb if we hadnt done the term auction facility
mr lacker  if i could just follow up
mr dudley  did i miss any
mr lacker  well on the last point thats a matter of the ecbs willingness to lend to
those institutions  youre saying that they would be willing to lend themselves to those institutions
only if we did this  its not about the economics of their borrowing from their central bank versus
borrowing from usnothing about the market functioning
mr dudley  i wouldnt say its about their willingness to lend to their institutions  its
their sense of what their responsibility is in terms of providing dollar liquidity to their institutions
to the extent that they could just passively take the dollars and funnel them through this auction
process in which their auction was very passivetheir auction was essentially a noncompetitive
auction that was based off oursthey were willing to do that  they were less willing to do
something in which they were taking responsibility for the problem and saying that they were going
to get the dollars and supply them to those banks
mr lacker  do market participants view foreign banking organizations as broadly
riskier than comparablesized institutions based in the united states
mr dudley  well its difficult to say  if you look at credit default swaps that would
say not  but as president rosengren and i were talking before the meeting those credit default
swaps may also contain different appetites to recapitalize banks when they get in trouble in the
united states versus abroad  so the one thing that we can probably say with confidence for the
period is that theres more anxiety that things are hidden in certain foreign banks that are probably
not as likely to be hidden in us banks  theres better disclosure in the united states on a faster
and more realtime basis  the market sense is that there isnt really the same kind of quarterly
disclosure process abroad that happens for us institutions
ms mosser  may i add one factual comment to that
mr lacker  absolutely
ms mosser  during the height of the dislocations in december the fed funds rate
overnight was regularly trading substantially higher early in the morningthis happened also in
august for a whileeither early in the us trading session or before that  our understanding from
market participants was that the reason for those higher rates in the morning was excess demand
from europeanbased institutions to borrow in the funds market and when the us institutions
became more active later in the day the funds rate would then go back down to the target
mr lacker  thanks  going back to the liborois spreadthat was what motivated
this  it has fallen a lot  the bidtocover ratio is falling  if we try to lend 30 billion three more
times we could get to a point at which we satiate the market in term funds
mr dudley  well first of all continuing that 30 billion is not supplying any additional
dollars so were just going to be rolling over maturing auctions
mr lacker  yes but the bidtocover ratio keeps falling
mr dudley  right  but second i would caution you that this last auction was right
before an fomc meeting and that may have diminished the appetite  we dont know with
certainty but our supposition is that the demand would have been higher if the auction had been a
week later if thats how the schedule had fallen  third february might be fine but march is a
quarterend  lastly the fact is that while the term funding pressures seem to be better a lot of other
things seem to be worse and clearly the pressure on bank balance sheets has not diminished at all
if anything it has grown more intense  so to remove this prematurely would be a risk especially
when market participants view this as helpful and it gives them a sense of confidence that the fed is
there
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  the questions that president lacker asked covered one of the questions i
wanted to ask  but as we go down in terms of the number of bidders as we proceed is the portion
that is foreign increasing relatively speaking  do we know
mr dudley  i dont remember any strong sense of that
mr lacker  its decreasing
mr dudley  what has happened as the auction has proceeded is that people have bid
more tightly around where they think its going to come except for a few institutions who just say
i want the money and they bid at very high rates because its a single price auction  you usually
see some behavior like that
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr lacker  foreign banks were 19 billion out of 20 billion at the first auction
18 billion out of 20 billion at the second auction and a declining fraction thereafter president
fisher
mr fisher  thank you president lacker
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  bill in your remarks you devoted quite a bit of time to the
deteriorating situation in the monolines the implication being that the risks they may have affect the
whole system  in the normal course do we have direct contact with them to get any insight beyond
what we get through analysts and rating agencies  i think you said that they are not terribly
transparent in terms of asset class and individual securities as to what they really hold  have we had
any direct dialogue just to inform ourselves as to what the real situation is
mr dudley  i havent had much contact with them  i dont know if tim has
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  we have not been in touch with them directly to get a
sense about their risk profile and so forth  we have had extensive conversations with the new york
state insurance commissioner who is the lead supervisor of many of them but not all of them  it
turns out that office also has very little information particularly on the stuff that is on the leading
edge of concern which is to whom they sold credit protection and on what  but it is in the process
of trying to remedy that and we have been giving them a little help in trying to figure out what they
need to ask for
mr dudley  another thing that is not very well known is what their assets consist of
we have rating buckets but we dont know what those ratings actually apply to  we dont know
who they have reinsurance with  some people think that theyre reinsuring each other to an extent
or they have reinsurance with subsidiaries that they own so that the insurance is not at arms length
so theres quite a bit of cloudiness about what their true condition is
vice chairman geithner  we have better information on the protection that banks
purchased from the monolinesby monoline and by underlying assetand it is important of
course to have that
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  yes  i would just note with the taf experience going back just for a
minute that the boston financial community has been overwhelmingly supportive  i dont know
whether you have gotten the same sense when you talk to the financial community in new york
but whether people were bidding or not they actually thought that it was quite a fruitful exercise  in
terms of the credit default swaps just looking at some of the institutions that were involved it
seemed as if the us institutions if you look at individual organizations may have had much
higher credit default swap rates than many of the foreign institutions  as you noted many of the
foreign institutions were substantially lower than at least a couple of the us ones that were
involved and we obviously thought the us ones were sound or we wouldnt have been willing to
have them participate  we should look at the libor rate but i think we should also look at the
treasury securities market because you dont have to do as much in open market operations if
youre doing some of it in the taf and weve had the interest rate on treasury securities quite low
so im wondering whether when we think about the analysis we look not only at things like
libor but also at the functioning of the treasury market and whether that was actually helped out
by this process  i dont know if youve done any work on that but it would be of interest to know if
that had helped with the better functioning of the treasury market
mr dudley  well i think the presumption is very much that it went in the right
direction in terms of the treasury market because basically the treasury has auctioned off larger
weekly onemonth threemonth and sixmonth bills to replace those that we were redeeming  so
the floating public supply of bills went up
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  very quickly we should not be surprised that banks like the taf  it
increases the banks profits because of the difference between the funding costs  the issue is
whether the taf improves the way the markets are functioning not whether its feeding profits into
the banks and whether they happen to like it
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i think its clear in bills presentation that theres a very
strong case that the taf the associated measures by other central banks and as important the
commitment and the signal that we would continue the taf longer than was necessary have been
very important to the improvement of market functioning and very important to the improvement
and confidence in liquidity and markets going forward  it is very hard to know how important it has
been to that but i think it has absolutely been very important and i think it is very important for us
to continue it until we can comfortably say it is no longer necessary in this context  i think we are
far from the point that we can claim that  it was 24 basis points in october president lacker and
there are a lot of reasons that we should be expecting to be living with a long period of fragility in
markets going forward  we all debated the merits of this going forward  theres a set of good
principled objections to this kind of stuff and i didnt expect that those objections would change on
the basis of the experience with this thing and i dont think weve learned anything new about the
merits of those objections except that theres a very good basis of evidence for suggesting it has
been important to the improvement in confidence and market functioning  one of our jobs isand
i think weve been pretty successful in doing ittrying to give some confidence to people that we
as the central bank have provided a quality of liquidity insurance more powerful than we can
through our classic instruments  i think it has been very successful in this context  to take it back
prematurely would be damaging to the improvements weve achieved
chairman bernanke  are there any other questions for bill  if not i need a vote to
ratify domestic operations
mr kohn  i move that we ratify the operations
chairman bernanke  objections  without objection  thank you  we turn now to
the economic situation  we begin with dave reifschneider whenever youre ready
mr reifschneider2  give me one second  on balance the news we have received since the december greenbook has been disappointing  the top panel of your first exhibit sorts some of the main indicators into two categoriesthose that were surprisingly weak and those that came in to the upside of our expectations  as you can see the list to the left is long  private payrolls fell in december and the unemployment rate jumped to 5 percent  manufacturing output has declined since the summer  singlefamily housing starts new permits and home sales have fallen further  new orders and shipments of capital goods were disappointing although a little less so after todays release of december data  business sentiment deteriorated joining already unusually low readings on consumer confidence  finally stock prices have tumbled and credit conditions have tightened  not all the news was bad
nonresidential construction activity has continued to be surprisingly robust and defense spending looks to have been higher last quarter than we anticipated
moreover retail sales in november came in stronger than we predicted and the figures for september and october were revised up  overall we read the incoming

data as implying an increased risk of recession  the middle left panel provides some evidence for this assessment  as was discussed at yesterdays board briefing based on the signal provided by 85 nonfinancial indicators the black line the estimated probability of being in recession now or over the next six months stood at 45 percent in december up from 19 percent in june  a similar exercise carried out using 20 financial indicators the red line yields an even bigger jump in the estimated likelihood of recession from 14 percent at midyear to 63 percent this month
as you know we are not forecasting a recession  while the model estimates of the probability of recession have moved up they are not uniform in their assessment that a recession is at hand  another argument against forecasting recession is that with the notable exception of housing we see few signs of a significant inventory overhang  in addition the recent weakness in the labor market and spending indicators is still limited for example initial claims have drifted down in recent weeks rather than surging as they typically do in a major downturn  finally a good deal of monetary and fiscal stimulus is now in process that should help support real activity  that said it was a close call for us  even without a recession our assessment of the underlying strength of aggregate demand has revised down markedly since the summer  this is illustrated in the bottom panel by the recent decline in the greenbookconsistent estimate of shortrun r the value of the real funds rate that would close the output gap in 12 quarters  by our estimate shortrun r has fallen more than 2 percentage points since the middle of last year and
1 percentage points since december  a jump in the equity premium accounts for most of the downward revision since the last greenbook although a further deterioration in the outlook for residential investment is also a factor
your next exhibit summarizes the current forecast  so how did we respond to all this bad news  as shown in the panel at the top we boosted real gdp growth a little from 2007 through 2009  in 2008 and 2009 however this faster growth is not demand driven but instead reflects upward revisions to the supply side of our forecast that i will discuss in a moment  for 2007 the upward revision to real gdp in the fourth quarternoted in the panel to the rightreflects the stronger data on nonresidential construction defense spending and retail sales that i just mentioned however because the incoming data point to a weaker trajectory for real activity in the near term we have trimmed our forecast of gdp growth for the first half of 2008 and we have marked down final sales growth not shown quite a bit  beyond the middle of the year we project real output to expand at a rate close to its potential
under these conditions we project greater labor market slack than in december with the unemployment rateshown in the middle left panelnow expected to edge up to 5 percent by next year  and as shown in the bottom two panels we continue to expect both core and total pce prices to decelerate noticeably by 2009 although inflation this year is likely to run a little higher than we previously projected
your next exhibit provides an overview of some of the key factors influencing the outlook  as shown in the upper left panel we conditioned our forecast on an additional 50 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and then held it flat at
3 percent  we made this revision in response to the weaker underlying level of demand in this projection but with an eye to keeping inflation on a longrun path to 1 percentthe midpoint of the range of 2010 inflation projections that you provided in october  another key element in the outlook is our assumption that concerns over financial stability and a possible recession will begin to abate once the economy gets through a rough patch in the first half of this year  as nellie will discuss in more detail this assumption implies that risk premiums on bonds and corporate equity should drift down over time  as a result we project that equity prices shown to the right will stage a partial recovery over the second half of 2008 and in 2009  these and other financial market developments coupled with an improvement in business and consumer sentiment should help to support consumption and investment over time
as regards fiscal policy odds now seem high for the passage of a fiscal stimulus package although the details are still up in the air  as a placeholder we built a
125 billion package into the baseline with two components75 billion in tax rebates that households will receive in the third quarter and a 30 percent oneyear bonus depreciation allowance that should cost the treasury about 50 billion in 2008 our judgment is that the rebate component will provide a significant albeit temporary boost to the level of consumer spending during the second half of this year and in early 2009 the period over which we expect most households to spend their checks  in contrast we think that bonus depreciation will have only a small effect on equipment and software outlays  as indicated by the blue bars in the panel to the right these assumptions imply a large fiscaldriven contribution from pce and es to real gdp growth in the second half of this year followed by a similarsized negative contribution in the first half of 2009  as a result the longrun contribution to real gdp growth from these two factors is essentially zero  we have assumed that inventories and imports in the short run will offset a substantial fraction of the swings in domestic demand thereby muting the overall effect of the fiscal package on real gdp growth the green bars
as i noted earlier we also have reassessed our supplyside assumptionsshown in the bottom left panel  specifically we have raised our estimate of potential output growth from 2005 to 2009 about  percentage point per year partly in response to the solid gains in output per hour recorded last year  these revised estimates have two important implications  first the upward revision to potential output translates roughly one for one into faster growth in actual output during the projection period because of its implications for permanent income and hence consumption and investment  second the revisions to potential output in history imply that the output gapshown to the rightcurrently is lower than we previously thought and we expect it to remain lower
your next exhibit provides some details on the realside outlook  as shown in the top left panel we have once again revised down the projection for new home sales in light of weak incoming data including those received after we put the greenbook to bed  however we continue to expect that sales will reach bottom in the first half of
this year and then begin to edge up as mortgage credit availability improves  this stabilization in demand should allow singlefamily housing starts shown to the right to level out at about 660000 units by midyear well below our december projection thereafter we anticipate a slow pickup in starts  as shown in the middle left panel builders still have a long way to go to bring the backlog of unsold homes down to a more comfortable level and this overhang should restrain construction activity into next year  we have also revised down the nearterm outlook for real business fixed investmentthe middle right panelin response to slowing sales tighter credit conditions and some deterioration of business sentiment but we now expect a greater cyclical rebound starting in the second half of this year as overall conditions start to improve  the bottom left panel shows our projection for consumption the blue bars together with the profile for spending excluding the effects of fiscal stimulus the green bars  absent the stimulus package we would expect consumer spending to increase only 1 percent this year but then to pick up around 2 percent in 2009 as confidence recovers and credit conditions ease  however the tax rebates will likely obscure this cyclical pattern by inducing sawtooth swings in spending with actual growth realigning with longerrun fundamentals only in the second half of next year as shown to the right some of these fundamentals are less favorable than before we estimate that wealth effects will hold down pce spending growth by  percentage point this year and almost  percentage point in 2009
your next exhibit reviews the inflation outlook  as indicated by the blue line in the upper left panel monthly readings on core pce inflation have moved up since the summer  we are inclined to take only a small signal from this movement much as we did early last year when price increases were unusually subdued  in part this is because a portion of the recent pickup was attributable to the erratic nonmarket component and quartertoquarter fluctuations in this category tend to fade away quickly  in addition while marketbased prices also came in higher than expected we are interpreting some of that surprise as a reversal of some earlier low readings in particular categories  that said we also think that a portion represents somewhat more persistent inflation pressure coming into 2008  we project both core and total pce inflation to moderate over time because of several factors  to begin with futures prices for crude oil imply the sharp deceleration in energy prices shown to the right  we also expect food prices the middle left panel to decelerate into 2009 partly as result of the increased production of beef and poultry that is now under way in addition the impetus to inflation from core import prices the middle right panel should diminish over time although by less than projected in december because we now anticipate a faster rate of dollar depreciation  these developments coupled with the additional economic slack built into this projection should help to keep inflation expectations anchored allowing actual inflation to fall below 2 percent in the longer run  indeed survey measures of longrun inflation expectations the blue and red lines of the bottom left panel remain stable  tips inflation compensation the black line jumped following the intermeeting fed funds rate cut as bill pointed out  but as was discussed in the memo by jonathan wright and jennifer roush that was circulated to the committee we are inclined to attribute most of this increase to changes in inflation risk and liquidity premiums not to a rise in inflation expectations
per se  putting all this together we project core inflationthe first column of the panel to the rightto remain at 21 percent this year but then to drop down to 19 percent next year the same as in december  similarly we continue to expect that headline inflation will slow to 2 percent this year and slide to 1 percent in 2009 as energy prices moderate  i will now turn the floor over to nellie
ms liang  as discussed earlier treasury yields and stock prices are down sharply since the december fomc meeting on news that indicated greater odds of a recession and large writedowns at financial institutions  as shown by the blue line in the top left panel of exhibit 6 the fall in stock prices pushed up the ratio of trend forward earnings to price  the difference between this ratio and the real treasury perpetuity yield shown by the shaded area and plotted to the right is a rough measure of the equity premium  as you can see this measure jumped in the past few months and is now at the high end of its range of the past twenty years  in the corporate bond market the spread on highyield corporates the black line in the middle panel widened sharply and investmentgrade spreads the red and blue lines also rose
forward spreads not shown rose especially in the nearterm suggesting particular concern about credit risk in the next few years  in the forecast we assume that the equity premium and bond spreads will recede some from their recent peaks as the risk of recession recedes and activity picks up but they will remain on the wide side of their historical averages  as shown in the bottom left panel our most recent indicators suggest that the ofheo national purchaseonly houseprice index the black line fell 2 percent in the fourth quarter we project further declines of about 3 percent in both 2008 and 2009  in some states with many subprime mortgages such as california arizona nevada and floridahouse prices the red line began to fall earlier and have declined by more  reports of spectacular writedowns from some financial firms may also have caused investors to assign greater odds of tighter financial conditions  as noted in the bottom right panel financial firms took writedowns and loanloss provisions of more than 80 billion in the fourth quarter
most of the reported losses were from subprime mortgages and related cdo exposures but many banks also increased loss provisions for other types of loans  in response financial firms raised substantial outside capital and cut dividends and share repurchases  still the risk remains that writedowns and provisioning will grow larger if house prices or economic activity will slow more than currently anticipated or if financial guarantors are downgraded further  moreover many of the largest firms are still at risk of further unplanned asset expansion from previous commitments for leveraged loans and their continued inability to securitize nonagency mortgages
consequently these firms are likely to be cautious in managing asset growth

your next exhibit focuses on business financial conditions  as shown by the black line in the top left panel topline operating earnings per share for sp 500 firms for the fourth quarter are now estimated to be about 23 percent below their
yearago level dragged down by losses at financial firms  for nonfinancial firms the green line earnings per share are estimated to be up 10 percent from a year ago
analysts estimates of q1 earnings for nonfinancial firms were trimmed a bit last week but suggest continued growth  robust profits since 2002 have put most
businesses in strong financial shape  as shown in the right panel loss rates on high yield corporate bonds the black line have been near zero for more than a year as very few bonds defaulted and recovery rates were high  however we project that bond losses will rise gradually in the next two years as the nonfinancial profit share slips from its currently high level  in commercial real estate the middle left panel the net chargeoff rate at banks the black line was low in the third quarter of last year despite a slight tilt up mostly from troubled loans related to residential land acquisition and construction  we project that this rate will rise fairly steeply reflecting weakness in housing and expected softening in rents for commercial properties
a similar outlook may lie behind the tighter standards for business loans reported in the january senior loan officer opinion survey  as shown by the orange line in the middle right panel the net percentage of domestic banks reporting having tightened standards on commercial real estate loans in the past three months reached 80 percent a notable increase from the october survey  in addition onethird of domestic banks tightened lending standards on ci loans in the past three months
large majorities of the respondents that tightened standards pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain outlook or a reduced tolerance for risk  despite wider spreads borrowing rates for investmentgrade firms are lower than before the december fomc meeting  as shown by the red line in the lower left panel yields  on tenyear bbbrated bonds the red line fell about 25 basis points and rates on thirtyday a2p2 nonfinancial commercial paper the blue line have plummeted about 200 basis points since just before yearend  in contrast yields on tenyear highyield bonds the black line are up and now are close to 10 percent  net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses shown in the right panel is on track in january to stay near the pace of recent months  net bond issuance the green bars has been sizable in recent weeks with most of that issuance by investmentgrade firms  unsecured commercial paper the yellow bars rebounded after substantial paydowns ahead of yearend
your next exhibit focuses on the household sector  as shown in the top left panel delinquency rates at commercial banks for credit cards the blue line and nonrevolving consumer loans the black line edged up in the third quarter as did rates for auto loans at finance companies through november  some of the recent rise in delinquency rates for credit cards is in states with the largest houseprice declines and could represent spillovers from weak housing markets  as shown to the right delinquency rates on subprime adjustablerate mortgages the solid red line continued to climb and topped 20 percent in november and delinquency rates on fixedrate subprime and on prime and nearprime mortgages also rose  looking ahead we expect delinquency rates on consumer loans to rise a bit from belowaverage levels as household resources are strained by higher unemployment and lower house prices
these developments have spurred lenders to tighten standards on consumer loans  as noted in the middle left panel responses to the january senior loan officer opinion survey indicate a further increase in the net percentage of banks tightening standards on credit cards and other consumer loans in the past three months  banks also
reported substantial net tightening of standards for subprime and prime mortgages with the latter up considerably from the october survey  in addition spreads on lowerrated tranches of consumer auto and credit card abs jumped in january amid news that lenders were increasing loanloss provisions  that said interest rates on auto loans and credit cards not shown are not up and most households still appear to have access to these forms of credit  as shown to the right issuance of securities backed by these loans was robust through january  securitization of nonconforming mortgages the grey bars in the lower left panel was weak in the fourth quarter of last year and there has been little if any this month  but agencybacked securitization the red bars was quite strong in the fourth quarter and appears to be again in january moreover as shown to the right interest rates have fallen appreciably  rates on conforming thirtyyear fixedrate mortgages the blue line and oneyear arms the red line fell and offer rates on prime fixedrate jumbo mortgages the black line are also down  the sixmonth libor the rate to which most subprime arms reset plunged in january although even at this level the first payment reset will still be substantial for many households
the next exhibit presents our outlook for mortgage defaults  the top left panel shows cumulative default rates for subprime 228 arms by year of origination  a default here is defined as a loan termination that is not from a refinancing or sale
the default rates for mortgages originated in 2006 and 2007 the red and orange lines respectively have shot up and for mortgages originated in 2006 about 18 percent will have defaulted by the loan age of eighteen months  this rate is higher at every comparable age than for mortgages made in 2005 the blue line and the average rate for loans made in 2001 to 2004 shown by the black line with the shaded area denoting the range across years  softer house prices likely played an important role in defaults on 2006 and 2007 loans because borrowers had little home equity to tap when they lost their jobs or became ill or they walked away when their mortgages turned upsidedown  these mortgages have not yet faced their first interest rate reset as shown to the right we expect a sizable number of borrowers to reset to higher payments about 375000 each quarter this year if these mortgages are not prepaid or rates are not reduced  while many borrowers still have time to refinance or sell before the first rate reset lower house prices and tighter credit conditions are likely to damp this activity  as noted in the middle left panel to project defaults on subprime arms we use a loanlevel model that jointly estimates prepayments and defaults
the model considers loan and borrower characteristics at origination subsequent msa or statelevel house prices and employment fluctuations interest rates and vintage effects  as shown to the right with data for the first three quarters in hand we estimate that defaults in 2007 about doubled from 2006 and predict that they will climb further in 2008 and stay elevated in 2009  these estimates imply that
40 percent of the current stock of subprime arms will default over the next two years
an important source of uncertainty around our projections is how borrowers will behave if falling house prices push their loantovalue ratios above 100 percent  as shown in the first line of the bottom left panel we estimate that 20 percent of
subprime borrowers had a combined loantovalue ratio of more than 100 percent in the third quarter of last year  if we assume that national house prices fall about
7 percent over the forecast period as in the greenbook an estimated 44 percent of subprime mortgages would have combined ltvs above 100 percent  a similar calculation for prime and nearprime mortgages shown in the second line indicates that a notinconsequential share 15 percent of these would also be upsidedown by the end of 2009  while prime borrowers likely have other financial assets upon which to draw in the case of job loss or sickness such high ltvs pose an upside risk to our baseline projection of defaults  another source of uncertaintythis one on the positive side of the ledgeris how loan modifications can reduce defaults or loss of a home  we have limited information but recent surveys indicate that loan workouts and modifications were modest through the third quarter of last year but likely accelerated in the fourth quarter  servicers are strained working on the large number of loans that are delinquent before the first reset  one survey indicated that servicers assisted about 150000 subprime borrowers in the third quarter which would represent about 15 percent of those with pastdue accounts but were not addressing current accounts with an imminent reset
as highlighted in the top panel of your next exhibit we summarize our projections for credit losses in the next two years for major categories of business and household debt  these projections rely on the paths for house prices unemployment interest rates and other factors from the greenbook baseline  we also present projections based on the greenbook recession alternative with the additional assumption that national house prices fall 20 percent  in this alternative scenario real gdp growth turns negative in 2008 and the unemployment rate rises above 6 percent in 2009  as shown in the first column of the bottom panel if we use the loss rates over the past decade or two as a guide to approximate losses under average economic conditions total losses line 6 would be projected to be 440 billion over the next two years  such losses could be considered what might be expected by lenders of risky debt in the normal conduct of business  but conditions over the next two years are not expected to be normal even under the baseline scenario  as shown in the second column losses under the greenbook baseline are expected to be considerably higher than average and total 727 billion given our outlook for only modest growth these losses might not greatly exceed the amounts that investors already have come to expect given signs of slowing activity  the aboveaverage losses are especially large for residential mortgages line 1 including those for nonprime mortgages line
2  in contrast losses for consumer credit line 3 and business debt line 4 are only a touch higher than normal  in the alternative scenario in which business and household conditions worsen further losses are projected to rise even more not only for mortgages but also for other debt  losses of this dimension would place considerable strains on both households and financial institutions creating the potential for moreserious negative feedback on aggregate demand and activity than is captured by our standard macroeconomic models  nathan will continue our presentation
mr sheets  your first international exhibits focus on the recent strength of the us external sector  as shown in the top panel of exhibit 11 us exports are now seen to have expanded at a moderate 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter following the 19 percent surge in the third quarter  with import growth in the fourth quarter stepping down to 2 percent net exports are estimatedas shown on line 3 to have made a positive arithmetic contribution to real gdp growth of 02 percentage point  going forward we see the external sector contributing 05 percentage point to gdp growth in 2008 and 03 percentage point in 2009  exports are expected to expand at a crisp 7 percent pace in both years supported by stimulus from the weaker dollar  the pace of import growth after stepping down on average in the first half of this year should pick up some through the forecast period broadly mirroring the contour of us growth  as shown in the bottom left panel some additional impetus to import growth should come from a projected decline in core import price inflation due to moderation in both exchangerateadjusted foreign prices the red bars and commodity price increases the blue bars  returning to line 4 of the upper panel we estimate that the current account deficit increased to 5 percent of gdp during the fourth quarter driven up by a surge in the oil import bill  we see the deficit declining to 4 percent of gdp in 2009 as the nonoil trade deficit narrows to just 1 percent of gdp  as shown on the bottom right the oil import billwhich has increased from around 1 percent of gdp early this decade to about 3 percent of gdp at presentlooms as an increasingly important factor influencing the evolution of the current account balance
your next exhibit examines us external performance from a longerterm perspective  as shown in the top panel the arithmetic contribution from net exports was persistently negative from 1997 to 2005 subtracting  percentage point on average from the growth of us real gdp  the contribution from net exports however has swung into positive territory over the past two years adding about
 percentage point to growth and we expect net exports to continue to make a positive contribution over the next two years  as shown in the middle left panel this upswing in the net export contribution has reflectedin roughly equal measurean acceleration in exports and a slowing of import growth  over the past two years export growth has stepped up to 8 percent more than twice its average 19972005 pace and it is projected to moderate only slightly in 2008 and 2009  in contrast import growth over the past couple of years has fallen off to less than half its 1997 2005 average and is expected to remain soft through the forecast period  the individual contributions of exports and imports to us gdp growth have both risen about  percentage point in recent years  this swing in us external performance has been driven in large measure by the cumulative effects of the decline in the dollar shown on the middle right  since its peak in early 2002 the dollar is down more than 20 percent in broad real terms including a 30 percent fall against the major currencies  we project that going forward the broad real dollar will depreciate at a pace of a little less than 3 percent a year with this decline coming disproportionately against many of the emerging market currencies including the chinese renminbi which have moved less since the dollars peak in early 2002  the bottom panel highlights another factor that has supported the shift in us external performance
from 1997 to 2005 us growth was on average just  percentage point below that of our trading partners  in recent years us growth has slowed relative to foreign growth and this gap has widened substantially reaching 1 percentage points on average in 2006 and 2007  this has consequently restrained imports relative to exports  our forecast calls for this gap to narrow only slightly through the forecast period  but this projection depends crucially on the resilience of growth abroadan issue that is examined in your next exhibit
recent data have confirmed our expectation that foreign activity slowed markedly in the fourth quarter  as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 13 economic sentiment in the euro area fell in december for the seventh consecutive month and the ecbs survey of bank lending pointed to further tightening of credit standards for both households and firms  in addition euroarea retail sales volumes and industrial production not shown have moved down in recent months  in the united kingdom the preliminary reading on fourthquarter gdp growth was surprisingly strong but other indicators seem to point to some softness going forward  as shown on the right the bank of englands new survey of credit conditions indicates a further decline in the availability of credit to corporations during the fourth quarter and the level of new mortgage lending has plunged  other indicators including consumer confidence have also slid of late  the japanese economy may be weakening as well as shown in the middle left panel the december tankan survey showed a further retreat in business confidence including a softening of sentiment among both large manufacturers and large nonmanufacturers  housing starts have declined dramatically lately as the construction sector adjusts to new tighter building standards  we also see signs that labor market conditions may be weakening  as shown in the bottom panel our assessment is that total foreign gdp growth slowed to about 2 percent during the fourth quarter distinctly down from the 4 to 4 percent pace recorded through 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007  notably the fourth quarter slowdown was broadly based  we estimate that growth in mexico line 8 declined sharply in line with a contraction in us manufacturing output  chinese gdp data which were reported after the greenbook went to press indicate that growth in the fourth quarter remained below its doubledigit pace in the first half of the year with exports posting a contraction
the middle right panel summarizes what we see as the key sources of this near term slowing  first a number of countries have experienced headwinds from the ongoing financial turmoil this is particularly the case for the euro area the united kingdom and canada  in addition sharp recent declines in equity markets have occurred in a much broader set of countries  the softening of us growth is a second factor weighing on activity abroad especially for countries like canada and mexico and many in emerging asia that have sizable trade linkages with the united states
third through 2006 and 2007 many of the foreign economies enjoyed exceptionally rapid cyclical expansions so some eventual moderation in the pace of growth seemed inevitable and we have been projecting a deceleration for some time  returning to the bottom panel we see these factors as continuing to weigh on foreign activity through the first half of the year  thereafter growth should gradually strengthen to
3 percent in the second half and to 34 percent in 2009 as financial turmoil subsides and as the us economy rebounds  nevertheless we expect that growth will remain well below the heady pace recorded over the past two years
as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 14 our foreign outlook is also supported by projected easing of monetary policy abroad  given mounting evidence of economic weakness and continued financial stress we see the ecb and the bank of canada cutting policy rates 50 basis points by the middle of the year and the bank of england easing 75 basis points  given the persisting inflation risks this is admittedly an aggressive call  but we see the case for monetary action as compelling and believe that these central banks will be persuaded notwithstanding their recent hawkish rhetoric  the futures markets also appear to be pricing in some easing albeit at a more gradual pace than we envision  finally we now expect the boj to remain on hold until the end of 2009  to be sure there are a number of risks surrounding our forecast most of which are on the downside  first the prevailing financial  headwinds or the slowing of us growth may be larger or more protracted than we currently project  second we do not yet have a good sense of the extent to which many foreign financial institutions have been affected by the recent turmoil and the release of yearend financial statements over the next six weeks or so could bring some bad news  a third risk is that overly optimistic expectations of decoupling may lead to policy mistakes  specifically to the extent that foreign authorities are convinced that they have decoupled from the united statesor that they are immune from spillovers due to the financial turmoilthey may be too slow to ease policy to address weakening demand  policy abroad may also be restrained by too narrow a focus on the recent rise in inflation a topic to which i will return momentarily
finally housing markets in some countries may be vulnerable  as shown in the bottom left panel many countries have experienced runups in house prices in recent years that are similar to or even exceed those recorded in the united states and house prices are now decelerating sharply in a number of these countries  further weakening of house prices poses the risk of adverse wealth effects  notably of the major economies shown in the right panel only the united states has yet seen a marked downward swing in the contributions from residential investment to gdp growth

your final international exhibit discusses our projections for foreign inflation  as shown in the top panel of exhibit 15 average foreign inflation jumped up to an annual rate of 4 percent in the fourth quarter with marked increases in both the advanced foreign economies line 2 and the emerging markets line 7  the sources of this rise in inflationincluding rapid increases in the prices of food and oilhave been well documented  going forward we see average foreign inflation moving back down to an annual rate of 2 percent in the second half of this year and continuing at that pace in 2009  despite the runup in realized inflation rates readings on longterm inflation expectations have remained well anchored  as shown in the middle left panel breakeven inflation rates for the advanced foreign economies have continued to hover around 23 percent on average and longterm inflation forecasts have stayed near 2 percent  for the emerging markets average longterm inflation forecasts shown on
the middle right have remained between 3 and 3 percent in recent years  the bottom panels show fourquarter percent changes for the prices of oil food and metals  given the marked slowing of global activity the stage seems set for some deceleration in commodity prices indeed metals prices are already on a downward trajectory  thus in line with quotes from futures markets we see the pace of increases in oil prices and food prices as declining significantly over the next few quarters  nevertheless we have been wrong on this score before and freely acknowledge that there are upside risks to this projection  brian madigan will now continue our presentation
mr madigan3  i will be referring to the separate package labeled material for fomc briefing on economic projections  table 1 shows the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008 2009 and 2010  central tendencies and ranges of the projections made by the committee last october are shown in italics  as for conditioning assumptions most of you see the appropriate nearterm path of the federal funds rate as at or below that assumed in the greenbook  eight policymakers explicitly assumed somewhat more nearterm easing than in the greenbook  however several of you assumed that policy would need to begin firming no later than 2009  many of you also projected that the funds rate would exceed the level forecasted in the greenbook by the end of the forecast period
as shown in the first row first column of table 1 the central tendency of your forecasts of real growth for 2008 has been marked down about  percentage point since last october  most of you remarked that a range of factors had prompted you to lower your growth expectations for the current year including the continued turmoil in financial markets and the resulting tightening of credit conditions the persistent deterioration in the housing market incoming data suggesting slower consumption expenditures and business investment growth and higher oil prices  a few of you suggested that stronger export demand as well as fiscal stimulus would provide some offset to weakness in private domestic demand particularly beginning later this year your halfyearly projections not shown suggest that you all think that more likely than not the economy will skirt recession  on average you see real gdp growing at an annual rate of about  percentage point over the first half before picking up to a 2 percent pace in the second half  as shown in the second row in view of the weak growth forecast for this year most of you revised up your expectations for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter about 04 percentage point to around
5 percent  most of you project slightly brisker growth this year than the greenbook doesperhaps partly reflecting the assumption that a number of you made that there would be more nearterm monetary ease than the staff assumed  as shown in the third and fourth sets of rows with incoming inflation data a bit higher than previously expected and despite projected weaker real activity the central tendencies of your projections for total and core pce inflation this year have increased about
03 percentage point  that upward revision is a bit larger than the 02 percentage point upward revision to the greenbook inflation forecasts but leaves the level of your projections close to those in the greenbook  most of you see total and core

inflation this year at a little above 2 percent  but as shown in the bottom section the upper limit of the range of your overall inflation projections for this year has moved up to 28 percent  your forecasts for total pce inflation this year remain a bit higher than for core inflation reflecting the expectation of higher energy food and in some cases import price inflation
looking ahead to next year your forecasts indicate that you expect economic growth to pick up as the drag from the housing sector dissipates and credit conditions improve  the midpoint of the central tendency of your forecasts for real gdp growth is 24 percent  your growth forecasts for next year are mostly above the staffs forecast of 22 percent perhaps again because a number of you assumed more aggressive policy easing in the near term and perhaps because at least some of you appear to see potential output growth as a bit brisker than the staff does  with most  of you evidently seeing growth a bit above trend next year the unemployment rate begins to edge lower but the central tendency of your unemployment projections still remains distinctly above that in october  although you are generally optimistic about improving conditions next year your views have become considerably more dispersed  as shown in the lower section the width of the range of the growth projections for 2009 has nearly doubled as has the width of the range of the unemployment projections  the third and fourth sets of rows in the upper panel indicate that most of you see overall and core inflation as moving below 2 percent next year  some of you said that those declines reflect less pressure from energy prices and with the unemployment rate above the nairu the emergence of some slack in the labor market  it is worth noting however that despite the easing of pressure on resources during 2008 and 2009 the central tendencies of your inflation projections for next year are essentially unchanged from october  this development presumably reflects your perception of some deterioration in the nearterm inflation output tradeoff perhaps prompted in part by the publication of surprisingly high inflation data for the fourth quarter of 2007 and an expectation that those effects will linger in 2009
turning to 2010 the interpretation of your longerterm projections is a bit less straightforward than it was in october  it was noted during the trialrun phase that a time may come when the economy is seen as unlikely to be in a steady state by the third year of the projection  to some extent that time seems to have already arrived in particular a comparison of the central tendencies for unemployment in 2010 from your january and october projections suggests that you now see a bit of slack persisting that year  the central tendencies and ranges of your total and core inflation projections for 2010 have changed just a bit from those in october but those changes might be viewed by outside analysts as significant  in particular the central tendency for total inflation in 2010 has inched up 01 percentage point and the lower limit of the central tendency for core inflation has increased the same amount  absent guidance to the contrary some analysts might now conclude that your comfort zone has edged up to 1 to 2 percent from 1 to 2 percent  to counter this impression presumably the published summary of economic projections should suggest that because a bit of economic slack is expected to persist at the end of 2010 inflation
could continue to edge lower beyond the projection period  this discussion however raises not only a presentational point but also a substantive one and that is why should your inflation projections for 2010 have revised up at all  true the inflationoutput tradeoff appears to have deteriorated a little recently but as dave reifschneider noted some of that deterioration is likely to be temporary  also higher inflation than otherwise might in principle be a consequence of taking out some insurance now against especially weak economic outcomes  but given the significant negative shock to aggregate demand embedded in your modal forecasts and the associated upward revision to slack across all three years of your projections as well as the absence of any upward revision to your inflation projections for 2009 even the small upward revision to your inflation projections in 2010 seems somewhat surprising
turning to the uncertainties in the outlook the upper panel of exhibit 2 shows that even more of you than in october judge that uncertainty regarding prospects for economic activity is higher than its historical level  even with the significant reductions in the target funds rate already in place and for many of you an assumption of more easing to come the lower panel illustrates that most of you still see the risks to growth as tilted to the downside  as reasons you again cited tighter credit conditions for households and businesses emanating from further disruptions in financial markets as well as the persistently deteriorating housing outlook  as shown in the upper panel of exhibit 3 more of you than in october see the uncertainty around your total inflation forecasts as close to that of the past two decades while a smaller minority viewed uncertainty as greater than in the past  as shown in the lower panel fewer of you now see the inflation risks as predominantly to the upside on balance as in october downside risks to growth were more frequently cited than upside risks to inflation which seems broadly consistent with each of the alternative policy statements that were in bluebook table 1  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  thats quite a bit of information to digest  does
anyone have questions for our colleagues  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i have a couple of questions that are somewhat
different  on the labor front im curious if you could offer some thoughts on how deterioration in
the labor market might be coming aboutwhether or not it would be from the hiring front or the
jobdestruction front  as the research literature has evolved over a long time i think it has moved a
bit away from job destruction playing the key role and more toward reductions in hiring  i wonder
how this informs the way you look at the data  any insights you have into that would be quite
helpful  then i wonder if you could just talk a bit more about the interesting memo that was
distributed on inflation compensation and the implications for expectations  as i read it it seemed
to indicate that inflation expectations if anything were coming down from the fiveyear forward
but that inflation compensation was higher  so does that mean that the variance of inflation is
higher  are people talking about the possibility of disinflation during this period  i would expect it
to come with that type of compensation  your thoughts on that would be great
mr reifschneider  do you want me to take that last question or do you want to
mr madigan  well i could start if you would like
mr reifschneider  go ahead
mr madigan  i think the points we are trying to make in that memo regarding inflation
compensation were that first of all its very difficult to make these judgments about what is going
on with inflation expectations inflation risk premiums and so on but our best reading of the
evidence was that probably inflation expectations have not moved up significantly recently  we
base that on a variety of indicators  i wont go through all of them now but to me the most
compelling evidence to support that point is that inflation compensation over the next five years has
actually come down over the intermeeting period and it is a little hard to rationalize why inflation
expectations would have risen so far out whereas in the near term they seem if anything to be
declining  of course various factors can affect inflation compensation including relative liquidity
and inflation risk premiums and we certainly dont want to exaggerate our ability to decompose
these changes into these various factors  it is possible that inflation risk premiums in particular
have moved up and some evidence does suggest that
mr evans  i neglected to say how interesting that memo was  the analysis is really
very good  i look forward to seeing more of it
mr reifschneider  the only thing i would add to brians statement is that i think
uncertainty about inflation in the long run could be moving up noticeably without really bringing
into play disinflation or something like that  in other words you could be more worried about going
down to 1 or 1 than you were beforei dont knowit could be more just as it was in the
forecast
mr mishkin  may i have a twohander on this
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  when you think about whats going on it is plausible that it is both up and
down  thats the key point here  because if you also look at the projections there is a lot more
uncertainty about whats going on in the real side of the economy  that could mean that inflation
could drift down and longerrun inflation expectations could drift down if in fact theres some
uncertainty about what the objectives of this committee are  on the other hand we actually did
take a very sharp interest rate cut and that could indicate that the committee might tolerate
somewhat higher inflation  so even though the action that was related to the big jump in inflation
compensation was a cut in interest rates i think there is a plausible argument that it could be
symmetric in terms of increasing uncertainty on both sides
mr evans  thats what i was focusing onthe meanpreserving nature of that
mr mishkin  i think it is consistent with your view but i just wanted to clarify
mr reifschneider  on job destruction versus a slower pace of new job creation its
hard to answer that one  some of those patterns have changed over time and in monitoring labor
market developments were trying to keep track of those two elements and that sort of thing
whether that would materially change the way we would look at say just what payroll employment
growth was doing it would still be one of our main reads coming in  as to exactly how that worked
out behind it im not sure it would make too much of a difference  i dont know whether dave
might want to add something to that
mr stockton  obviously we would be monitoring those developments  we are
monitoring the gross flows in the labor market and i think to a large extent the slowing that we
have seen thus far in employment growth has come more from a slower pace of hiring than it has
from an increase in layoffs  more recently in the jolts data as of november there has been a
significant increase in layoffs and discharges and there has been some further slowing in hiring
if we were to truly move into a recession you would still see a lot of layoffs and there would be
a fair amount of job destruction so the cyclical aspect would still likely show through pretty
strongly
mr evans  i guess i was thinking that if you talk to people you hear more about the
job destruction aspect but you dont hear quite the same information about hiring except you
might hear more nervousness  thats all
mr stockton  hiring plans have come off a bit in most of the surveys that we
follow but just a bitnot a lot yet
chairman bernanke  president lockhart did you have an interjection
mr lockhart  yes  my staff is suspicious that the employment numbers have
actually been weaker than the data have shown  they have been focusing on the birthdeath
model and the payroll survey is based upon assumptions related to the birth of construction
firms which logically would not be creating jobs in this environment  do you have a take on
that issue
mr stockton  well if bill wascher who is our expert in this area wanted to say
something i would certainly let him go ahead and say something
mr wascher  sure  the birthdeath model basically assumes that the cyclical
properties of births and deaths are the same as for continuing establishments  the bls has only
about five years of experience with the birthdeath model so i think it is pretty difficult to judge
whether they need to make any additional adjustments in births and deaths other than the same
pattern that occurs in terms of net employment changes in continuing firms  but without much
to go on they dont take a very strong stand on whether they do a very good job of picking up
the turning points because they dont have any history on which to base their analysis  so i think
there are reasons to suspect that that is possibly the case but i dont think there is any strong
evidence that it is and it is important to note that they do assume some cyclicality in births and
deaths in their procedures
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  brian i want to ask you about the projections
well it is more than an exercise nowthe projections that we are offering are for real  what is
the message that comes out of the projectionsthat is if i am talking to the press or to others
and they say what do i make of all of this  my question to you is what do you make of all
of this  what is the message for the implications for policy or the implications for anything
you know the data dont really speak for themselves  we are throwing out a lot of stuff here to
the market and what is the market supposed to make of it
mr madigan  well that is a hard question actually  you know obviously in some
sense the numbers at some level do speak for themselves
mr poole  okay  what are they telling us  laughter
mr madigan  i think they say that the committee is expecting relatively slow
growth in the period immediately ahead but that the economy avoids a recession  there is some
recovery over the subsequent years  it is not extraordinarily brisk  it is a fairly gradual recovery
in terms of growth  the unemployment rate moves up a little as you would expect with a period
of growth below trend but does not get extraordinarily high and inflation after coming under
some upward pressure of late gradually edges back down to levels below 2 percent  i am not
sure that i am saying anything terribly enlightening here  of course one point that i should
emphasize is that the full summary of economic projections we hope gives more texture than i
was just able to give to the committees views about the modal outcome and to the committees
concerns about the risks to both growth and inflation
mr poole  the reason i raise the question is that it seems to me very important that
we have some interpretation as to what we make of all this and what we want the market to make
of all this  in particular lets say the observation that the projections or the risks are weighted to
the downside  you might get some people saying well if we get some employment reports or
others that in fact come in weaker than anticipated that means that the committee is on the edge
of pulling the trigger to respond to it  that might be a possible message that people would take
from this  if that is not the message that we want to convey then we had better be very careful
how we talk about these
chairman bernanke  president poole i would just point out that when these are
released it will be simultaneous with my testimony to the congress and so i will have
opportunities to put some context on it at that time
mr poole  i guess my question is directed as much to the chairman as it is to brian
which you will answer in the testimony
chairman bernanke  i will answer in the testimony  laughter  president
fisher
mr fisher  first i too wanted to thank you all for the paper on forward inflation
compensation  i agree with the conclusion that it is difficult  especially in times of strained
trading conditions i think that is the conclusionwhether you interpret the outcome the way it
was interpreted in the paper or the way i do it more cynically i think that is the key underlying
point  i thought that was a very valuable useful paper and i want to thank you governor
mishkin for commissioning it
my question is to nathan on your inflation projections  reading through the
greenbookeven though the section on the international side is very thinwith the exception
of china where i think we can sell a lot of whip inflation now buttons and of argentina
where the numbers are rigged but even in those countries what i took home was that everybody
was surprised on the upside in every country ranging from the advanced countries as we call
them to turkey  then if you look at the exhibit 15 that you just presented to us those numbers
are confirmed in the fourth quarter and then there is a sharp falloff proceeding from there  you
gave us a good analysis of the risk to the foreign outlook in growth and then you concluded your
comment on inflation by saying that we have been wrong before that there is some upside risk
so my question is what are the risks on the inflation side  could you elaborate on them just as
you elaborated on the risks to growth in the foreign outlook
mr sheets  we are happy to hear that there is demand for a bigger international
section  laughter  you had better be careful what you wish for
mr fisher  but i am very serious about this  suddenly there is a falloff  would you
give us a sense of the risk  it cant be all onesided
mr sheets  right  just a word of background  the rationale for the falloff is the
expected decline in these commodity prices and the expected slowing of global demand  now
thinking about the risks i am reasonably convinced that global demand is going to slow which i
believe will translate into reduced demand for many of these commodities that have driven up
inflation  however that says something only about the demand side of these commodity
markets  there is also a lot going on on the supply side  at the last fomc meeting we talked
about ethanol and the fact that many of these emergingmarket countries are wealthier that they
want to eat better than they used to that the relative price of energy has risen and that it takes a
lot of energy to raise these crops  so there are supply factors as well as demand factors at work
in driving up these commodity prices  it is very hard for us to forecast the supply side of these
markets  it is driven by things like weather and geopolitical developments and so on and so
forth  on the commodities my sense is that demand is going to shift in to some extent  as long
as the supply doesnt shift in as well we should be able to see a decline or at least a slower rate
of increase in these prices  a very important point here is that in order to get less of an impetus
coming from commodity prices and inflation in these countries we dont necessarily need oil
prices to come down in level terms  we just need them to stop going up at such rapid rates  if
we get slower rates of price increases that will be disinflationary relative to where we have been
that is how i would characterize the risks around this forecast mainly on the supply side of
these commodity markets
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  nellie i have two
questions for you  one is on exhibit 9 where you forecast in the middle right panel the rate of
increase in defaults on subprime arms  if you compare that with your reset rate estimate and
your houseprice assumption or the houseprice assumption in the market i wonder whether that
looks a little optimistic  can you just say a little more about why under the baseline scenario
given what has happened to house prices already and what is ahead you wouldnt think that
would be substantially greater
ms liang  we have revised this forecast up quite a bit since the first time we looked
at this maybe in june or august in part because of lower house prices and tighter credit
conditions  the model requires as inputs defaults and prepayments and the prepayment rates
have been fairly slow but not zero  the 2006 vintage as it approaches its first reset has been
that 20 to 25 percent are able to prepay  they are able to find something  so we dont want to
assume that none of them will be able to  the model would approach both of those so that is the
positive side  the downside is that our forecast with the national houseprice assumption of
roughly minus 7 over the forecast period does imply houseprice declines on the order of minus
20 percent a year or more in california florida and some other places  that does leave the
loantovalue ratio as i mentioned pretty high for many borrowers  we have never had this
kind of episode so we have to make a judgment about the point at which subprime borrowers
walk away from their houses  the current assumption is that at about 140 percent we just say
you are out but it has to be almost an assumption that if by then you hadnt defaulted we would
push you out  so there is an upside  on the other hand saying 40 percent of the outstanding
stock will default over two years sounds like a big projection as well  so we tried to balance
there are risks on both sides for sure
vice chairman geithner  thank you  my second question is about your
projected credit loss and i apologize if you said this in your introduction  are these losses
across all holders of that credit risk
ms liang  yes  we have not distinguished between who is holding the securities
banks or investorsso mortgages would include the 20 percent or so that are commercial banks
and it would also include those held by investors in the primary form
vice chairman geithner  we being the fed know a fair amount about what
banks hold  do you have a crude estimate of what share of this banks hold or what share of this
would end up being eaten by banks
ms liang  in mortgages 20 percent is actually probably a pretty good estimate
vice chairman geithner  for all the credit
ms liang  they have that much of the business sector and that much of the
mortgages so that pretty much covers it
vice chairman geithner  i am just trying to get at how you interpret this  so
20 percent of the additional 600 billion relative to normal or relative to bank capital cushions
now is what  is it a lot or not so much
ms liang  one issue here is whether you want to do it relative to current capital
cushions  banks can raise capital  if they anticipate that they will need to raise capital they can
cut dividends further  i havent done that sort of exercise  one way to think about this is that the
average longrun rate is about 60 basis points on debt in the greenbook baseline it runs to about
1 percent and in the alternative it gets close to about 1 percent of debt  so it is not outside the
realm of history  it is on the high side
vice chairman geithner  we have had some bad points in history  i am not
trying to force you to give a prediction but were you reassured by this or troubled by it
fundamentally in terms of the capacity of the financial system to absorb it
ms liang  no i understand  i think the third alternative gets beyond what most are
expecting at this point
vice chairman geithner  yes i would agree with that
ms liang  in that sense it does represent a risk that you are going to get dynamic
feedback between losses and household spending and lendingit is a high risk  so i wouldnt
say comforted  i think we were saying that this is beyond probably what our models could
respond to in our typical way or it would be another dynamic feedback loop of some sort that we
dont typically adjust for
chairman bernanke  president plosser  oh i am sorrya twohander
mr rosengren  just a quick followup this doesnt include losses from securities  it
is only the loans right
ms liang  the loans could be packaged in securities  this is debt  it includes all
debt  now whether it is repackaged into an mbs it would be there  it wouldnt be if it got in a
cdo or something
mr rosengren  just in corporate bonds for example
ms liang  yes  it includes corporate bonds
mr rosengren  okay  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have three questions  let me go to brian
first  this is more of a comment  in your description of the forecast you referred several times
to the notion that there might be slack in the economy in 2010 based on these numbers  i guess
my reaction to that while i was kind of skeptical i am not sure exactly how you infer that from
what was reported  certainly that seems to be true in the greenbook forecast but trend growth
seems to be as good as or better than it was in the last projection  in 2010 inflationtrueis a
little higher  the unemployment rate may be a 01 or 02 percentage point higher  but unless
you infer something about what people thought the nairu might be i dont know how you
would necessarily infer that the reason inflation went up in these forecasts was that there was
slack in the economy in these projections  so i just wanted to caution about the language we use
in how we describe what we see here without necessarily inferring something about whether in
any individual persons forecast there may or may not have been slack  in mine there wasnt in
2010 but i dont see that necessarily follows from what these numbers look like  that was my
only observation here
mr madigan  maybe i can respond to that  it is very inferential and it is based
partly on the twotenths difference from the october exercise when it was actually cleari
think clearer at that timefrom participants forecasts that many participants characterized their
nairu as being in the vicinity of 4 percent  unfortunately the writeups this time were not all
that explicit on this point but it is the comparison with october that i was leaning on fairly
heavily
mr plosser  i have two other questions that i would like to pose  one is the change
in the greenbooks assumption about the increase in potential gdp  in particular i am curious
because what it essentially does it seems is to build in a significant amount of slack or output
gap in 2009 and 2010 that didnt exist in the last greenbook  i am inferring that part of the
reason the moreaggressive easing in the policy assumption does not have any effect on inflation
to speak of is that it is offset by the increased gap that you have built in  so i would like a little
more explanation about the justification for building in a greater gap or a higher potential  but i
am also curious to know if you hadnt done that what your forecast for growth and inflation
would look like in lets say 2009 and 2010  could you give some guesstimate of how that
might have affected it
mr reifschneider  in terms of the rationale for increasing potential going back
over history some of that as i think i mentioned was just that actual productivity performance
has been better than the last time we reviewed this in the summer and we are taking that on
board  that is part of the motivation  another part of the motivation is what we perceive is a
somewhat growing tension between the way we saw labor market slack developing and the way
we were looking at slack in terms of the product side through the output gap  we had arrived at
a point this round where those tensions had increased over time and this revision mitigates some
of that tension so those two things are in better alignment with each other  we also were taking
the opportunity when we opened up to look at some other technical factors we used that get
involved in going from say the nonfarm business sector to gdp that sort of thing and those
also pushed us in the direction of being a bit more optimistic on growth going back  so we did
view it if you look at it in terms of product markets as that there was more slack now than we
had previously been thinking and that there was also more slack in the labor marketbut that
was from the actual data that came in  going forward we have more slack  we have more slack
just in the labor market because we have revised up the unemployment rate  with that and
taking on board these assumptions of potential output we have more slack on the output side
now one question would be to address your second question how would things have
changed if we hadnt taken that on board  well going forward we would have written down a
lower gdp forecast because what we are really saying here is that it is not that households and
firms have changed their perceptions this is just us the poor econometricians trying to infer
what is out there in the real world  so the poor econometricians have inferred that potential
output is growing stronger  we have to look at it and say well so the prospects going forward
for permanent incomes corporate earnings and that sort of thing will be stronger and that
implies basically a oneforone ratcheting up  if we had said well no potential output
growth going forward wont be stronger we would have revised down the gdp growth rate
with it so there wouldnt have been any change in the output gap from that  that would have
been shifting one for one  it wouldnt have changed our sense of what resource utilization would
be going forward
mr plosser  so are you saying that your path of the gap would have been
unchanged
mr reifschneider  the path of the gap would have been to a first approximation
unchanged going forward  some of the greater resource utilization now and going forward is a
combination of the fact that we havent really changed our view on the labor market aside from
once we took on board the new unemployment rate data but that we did change on the product
market  going forward the way it evolves further on we see the labor market gap opening up a
little more and the output gap opening up a little morethat is driven primarily by our sense that
the economy in an underlying sense is weakerand we have made an adjustment for that with
the monetary policy assumption  but it is not quite enough  we havent lowered the funds rate
as much as we would have needed to do to totally wipe out that fact and keep resource utilization
constant going forward on the product side  this is a difficult question  it was a difficult one for
us definitely going through it because we had many moving parts
mr plosser  well it does really change the character of the forecast substantially i
think
mr reifschneider  if you think about the forecast as resource utilization and
inflation then it has an effect on resource utilization that is bigger now going forward in the
product market  we also see a bigger effect in the labor market and if that were the only thing
it would have put more downward pressurebut not a loton inflation  but as i mentioned we
are coming into this forecast with somewhat worse inflation performance lately and we think
that has some persistence  so that is helping balance it out
mr plosser  my last question is also related to some adjustments that struck me in
the panel you talked about where you constructed the revised estimates of r  the first item on
your list that you talk about was that the equity premium had gone up and that was a big factor
so i have a couple of questions  that was an adjustment factor  now the way i would think
about the stock market declining would be primarily having a wealth effect that works its way
through consumptionthat would be the normal channel  yet the greenbook and this
discussion seem to suggest that somehow there was an additional adjustment made because of
the rise in the equity premium  is that correct or not or is it just the wealth effect that you are
talking about  are these separate
mr reifschneider  no it is not separate the equity premium is a large reason that
we had the big drop in stock values
mr plosser  but is the mechanism through a wealth effect on consumption growth
mr reifschneider  mostly but not totally
mr plosser  well what does that mean
mr reifschneider  i would say a couple of things  one you can think of the cost
of raising capital through equity as having some small influence on business investment  that is
pretty small  the big effect would be primarily on consumption as you mentioned  wealth
effects to a smaller extent would affect housing as well  but i think of that as a wealth channel
but there is a bit of a costofcapital effect through raising funds through equity that you might
think of as well  another thing i would say is that the difficulty here is distinguishing the equity
premium from general risk concerns risk premiums in general or increased compensation for
higher risk or default risk in a number of these credit spreads we are talking about those are sort
of related  it is hard to keep these things separate in any kind of an accounting  also these
things tend to be correlated with consumer and business sentiment  again that is another thing
that is hard to keep separate
mr plosser  so are these extra channels if you want to call them thattypically
part of the forecast change and how you evaluate  that is to say in the fall when the stock
market booms 10 percent are we going to get another kicker upward in r due to these same
factors
mr stockton  yes
mr reifschneider  it might not happen  i mean you could have a situation in
which business sentiment would not take a hit for example simultaneously with the stock
market tumbling and you would not see some risk premiums on bonds going up  that would be
very unusual
mr plosser  i am just reacting to this very large change in your estimate of r and
attributing it to equity premiums and i was just trying to figure out both
mr stockton  we just had a really big drop in the stock market and that is the
biggest piece of what is going on  but we have also marked down considerably our housing
forecast  that is in an exogenous shift in aggregate demand the is curve  that is another chunk
of what is going on here  we have had some increase in risk spreads not just in the equity
premium  despite the fact that treasury rates have fallen corporate bond yields have not as
much and we dont have as much there so there is in general a widening of risk premiums
mr plosser  well i am just trying to sort out how much of this is really due to the
stock market moving around
mr stockton  a big chunk of this is due to the stock market so i dont know what
we can do other than to take that on board in our forecast  as dave noted there are a few other
small wrinkles and we didnt just invent those extra wrinkles this time around  they have
always been there  but most of this is working through the wealth effect on the consumer
spending side  so it is a weaker stock market and much weaker consumption  that is the
aggregate demand channel  the other piece is housing which i dont want to minimize because
in fact that is another nontrivial factor holding down demand and we think depressing our
estimate of the equilibrium funds rate here over the intermediate term
mr plosser  i didnt understand that this was just primarily the wealth effect or
whether you were referring to something different
mr stockton  no nothing different  again the way the stock market and other
elements of spending operate is a little more complicated than just a consumer spending channel
but it really is wealth effect
chairman bernanke  i wonder if i could entice anybody for a cup of coffee
laughter  why dont we take a fifteenminute break and then well commence with the go
round  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  if it is okay with everybody we can start the economic go
round at this point  president poole you are up
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i am not sure how i got to be first here but i
guess i was being unusually agreeable when debbie asked me  laughter  the general tenor of
comments that i hear from our directors and people around the eighth federal reserve district
these are the community bankers and smaller firmsis that things are slow but not disastrously
slow  the comments that i hear from a series of phone calls to much larger national companies
are decidedly more pessimistic with one exception that i will talk about in a moment  my
contact at a large national trucking firm says that they are in a 20month recession in
transportation  they are cutting their capacity cutting the number of trucks and i think the
numbers on their capex illustrate the situation  for 2006 410 million for 2007 336 million
and their plan for 2008 is 200 million  that is down a little more than 50 percent in two years
so they are really cutting back  i also called friends at ups and fedex and generally things are
not a whole lot different but a little weaker than they have been  neither firm has any particular
issues with labor supply  domestic express business is flat and customers are switching to the
lowerpriced services instead of overnight delivery at the end of the afternoon shifting to ground
services and that sort of thing  on international business usoutbound volume for fedex is
up 6 percent  that would be consistent with the export increases that we have seen  reports are
that asia is a bit slower but is still growing very rapidly  asia to the united states is up
80 percent 20 percent to europe and latin america  the freight market is deadthat is the way
my contact put itdown 5 percent year over year  that is consistent with my trucking industry
contactand pretty much the same with ups  my contact with the fast food industrythe
quickserve restaurant or qsr businesssays the demand there is definitely weak  they are
coming in roughly flat i guess or actually down so far this year  prices are up because of the
increase in food costs  the casual dining industry is in worse shape than the fast food industry
my contact also follows retail in general pretty closely and finds that retail business in general is
weak  that is consistent with a lot of the reports that we have been receiving
a major exception is in the it areasoftware  i have contact with a large software
company and the contact noted that as announced microsoft had a fantastic quarter  the
earnings were up sharply  pc hardware sales are growing at a rate of 11 to 13 percent expected
in the first half of this year so we see strong growth in the pc market  consumer demand is
stronger than business demand  both however are pretty strong  the international business is
doing better in part because the industry is having some success in reducing the amount of
software piracy  the biggest problem is finding software engineers  this particular company is
running 8 percent behind its hiring forecast and cannot find software engineers  positive for us
old guys some of the retirees are coming back to write code  laughter  thank you  that is all
i have
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i broadly agree with the greenbook forecast
for economic growth this year and with the assessment that the downside risks to that forecast
are considerable  the severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the
economy at if not beyond the brink of recession  my forecast incorporates fiscal stimulus of the
same magnitude as the greenbook and monetary stimulus that is somewhat larger  i have
assumed a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and an additional 25 basis point cut during the first
half  my forecast shows growth of 1 percent in 2008 like the greenbook but it has a more
pronounced acceleration in 2009 as the monetary and fiscal stimulus kickstarts the economy
the unemployment rate edges up this year to 5 percent before dropping gradually next year
toward the natural rate of 4  i am especially concerned about the outlook for consumer
spending  the combined hits to equity and housing wealth will extract a considerable toll and
consumer spending will be further depressed by slower growth in disposable income due to
weaker employment growth  delinquencies and chargeoffs on most forms of consumer debt
have already risen and slower job growth seems likely to exacerbate this trend prompting
financial institutions to further tighten credit standards and terms  in my forecast such
developments reverberate back negatively onto economic activity
like the greenbook i downgraded my economic outlook substantially since our last in
person meeting  the december employment report was probably the single most shocking piece
of real side news prompting this revision  but knowing that it is unwise to put too much weight
on any single piece of data i have been examining the question of whether that report was more
signal or noise  the drop in initial ui claims to relatively low levels in recent weeks makes such
an assessment important  because the behavior of both series may have been affected by
seasonal factors near yearend it seems worthwhile to examine a broad range of data bearing on
the labor market  my conclusion is that the labor market has indeed been weakening since
mid2007 and the extent of weakening while relatively modest thus far is quite typical of
patterns seen when the economy is tipping into recession
independent evidence of a weakening in the labor market comes from the household
survey  even when adjusted for definitional and measurement differences from the payroll
survey the household survey shows a fairly smooth trend of declining employment growth
during 2007  the drop in payroll employment in december helped bring the establishment data
into closer alignment with the household employment data  in the payroll survey the slowdown
is concentrated in construction and finance  in the household series higher unemployment is
actually widespread across sectors  the household survey also contains other signs of a
weakening job market  a 25 percent increase in the unemployment rate for job losers which
accounts for the lions share of the overall increase in aggregate unemployment an increase in
the number of newly unemployed job losers which can be thought of as a broader measure than
ui claims of inflows into unemployment and an increase of 5 to 10 percent in the estimated
expected completed duration of an unemployment spell suggesting a reduced pace of outflows
from unemployment  the labor force participation rate of men and women of age 16 to 24 years
has also fallen notably in recent months  labor force participation rates for this group have been
edging down since the last recession but the decline accelerated in 2007 and historically this
group is among the first to respond to weakening labor market conditions
data from the jolts survey which we discussed in the qa round confirm the
weakness revealed elsewhere  the job openings or vacancy rate is down consistent with the
reduced pace of outflows from unemployment as reflected in continuing ui claims and
unemployment durations and layoffs and discharges are up sharply  other data cited in the
greenbook part 2 such as net hiring plans for manpower and nfib and survey measures of job
availability and unemployment expectations further corroborate a slowdown  with the aggregate
unemployment rate now up only 06 percentage point off its low i would describe the
deterioration in the labor market thus far as modest but it is noteworthy that an increase in
unemployment of this magnitude in the space of 12 months has occurred only twice since 1948
outside of recessions
while my modal scenario contains a nearterm slowdown rather than a contraction it is
actually pretty rosy compared with what i fear might happen  my contacts have turned decidedly
negative in the past six to eight weeks and further financial turmoil may still ensue  on
consumer spending two large retailers report very subdued expectations going forward
following the weak holiday season which involved a lot of discounting  on hiring and capital
spending my contacts have emphasized restraint in their plans due to fears that the economy will
continue to slow  a serious issue is whether the tightening of credit standards that is under way
will deepen into a fullblown credit crunch  the new senior loan officer opinion survey shows
a noticeable tightening in lending standards and this is confirmed by my contacts  for example
senior officers of a large bank in my district recently described a variety of new steps they are
taking to protect against credit losses  they are tightening underwriting practices across the
entire consumer lending and small business loan portfolio  a recent strategy has involved
classifying msas according to whether their real estate markets are stable soft distressed or
severely distressed using both historical and prospective views of property values  based on
these designations the company has reduced permissible combined loantovalue ratios in their
home equity portfolio and going forward they intend to apply them across the entire consumer
portfolio  on the positive side though they note that lower interest rates have spurred a surge in
applications for mortgage refinancing and a recent analysis shows that the reduction in the prime
rate is having a significant impact on arm reset expectations shifting a large number from
increases to reductions at reset  in fact an analysis conducted before our most recent rate cut
that assumed a 7 percent prime rate in february 2008and it is now at 6estimates that
twothirds of the subprime arm portfolio would now experience a decrease in their monthly
payments at reset  this is a sharp contrast from an analysis in june 2007 with a prime rate of 8
percent
now let me turn briefly to inflation and inflation expectations  i project that inflation will
decline over the forecast period to around 1 percent and i see the risks around that forecast as
balanced  admittedly though the recent data on inflation have been worrisome and they raise
the issue of whether or not we can afford to cut rates as much as needed to fight a recession
without seriously risking a persistently higher rate of inflation and inflation expectations  i tend
to think this risk is manageable largely because of the credibility we have built  it appears to me
that this credibility has reduced the response of inflation to all the factors thought to influence it
including energy prices the exchange rate and business cycle conditions  thus i consider it less
likely that rising energy prices are going to push up core inflation very much or that the pass
through that does occur will easily get built into inflation expectations  so i view inflation as
less persistent now than it once was tending to revert fairly quickly to the publics view of our
inflation objective  i do hope that our longrun inflation forecast will help people identify what
that objective is  but even if inflation expectations turn out to be less well anchored than i think
i still see the inflation risk going forward as roughly balanced  with less well anchored inflation
expectations there is greater risk that higher energy and import prices will pass through into core
inflation and inflation expectations  by the same token there is also a greater likelihood that
inflation will decline should a recession occur  we looked at the behavior of core and total
inflation in the first three years following recessions from 1960 to the last one in 2001 and
inflation declined in most of these episodes  the exception is 2001 when core inflation
remained essentially unchangedwhich seems consistent with my view that inflation has
become less responsive to the business cycle over the past decade or so as we have acquired
more credibility
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
vice chairman geithner  excuse me  could i ask
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  president yellen i think you answered this but could
you say a bit more about your monetary policy assumption in your forecast  how did you get to
an additional 75
ms yellen  we assumed 50 at this meeting
vice chairman geithner  fifty plus 25
ms yellen  we assumed an additional 25 which would be held in place through
2009q1 and then a gradual rise
vice chairman geithner  i mean the why not the what  sorry
ms yellen  the why
vice chairman geithner  yes  why that much rather than
ms yellen  a larger amount  i wouldnt attach too much significance to the precise
figureits somewhat more
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the fifth district economy has shown
additional signs of softness in recent weeks  according to our surveys manufacturing activity
drifted lower in the past few months although we also heard reports of stronger overseas demand
for us goods  revenue growth in the districts services firms also weakened in january and
our index for that sector dipped into negative territory for only the second time in the past four
years  our retail index which in december had blipped up to neutral after three negative
months dived again in january  our retail respondents say that the holiday sale season finished
up weaker than expected and that big ticket categories continue to slump especially furniture
and appliances  business spending seems to have softened as well in recent weeks as an
increasing number of firms reported that they were delaying capital spending projects such as it
upgrades
at our december meeting i reported on a former director who headed a firm that owned
a large portfolio of retail properties and said that he described the sector as in the best shape he
had ever seen in his life  well he is singing a different tune  although his portfolio is in good
shape so far he is hearing a lot about cancelled projects as a result of financial constraints from
lenders or equity interests and he says that the environment that he is operating in is completely
different from what it was when he talked to me sixty days ago  we are hearing very similar
comments from a wide range of contacts in commercial real estate and community bankers
residential real estate markets in the district remain generally weak  home sales and
construction remain dormant in many markets  several realtors reported seeing more
prospective buyers but they seem interested only in kicking the tires in part because of
difficulties in selling their current homes
turning to prices concerns about rising input costs were more widespread among our
contacts in recent weeks  our survey measure of manufacturing raw material prices was up
sharply in january at 43 percent the second highest reading in the fourteenyear history of the
survey  the pricespaid measure in manufacturing was a touch lower but still in an elevated
range  expected price trends in manufacturing were off sharply however perhaps reflecting the
softening in demand that many respondents said they expected  in the service sector both
current and future price trends picked up outside of retail  labor market conditions in the fifth
district have deteriorated in the last month  in a noticeable shift from previous surveys
numerous contacts told us they had begun to trim payrolls  the job cuts were concentrated in
machinery and building material manufacturers financial services firms and general contractors
in some regions howevernorthern virginia for examplesome labor markets remain tight
and we continue to hear of difficulty finding highly skilled workers
i spent a bit more time than usual on our regional picture because right now i am placing
a bit more weight than usual on our district reports and what i read in the beige book  one can
be skeptical about the incremental value of anecdotal reports in typical times but at times like
these i believe they can and do provide a more timely read on what is going on  these regional
reports have shaded my outlook to the downside relative to the picture painted by the national
data which is itself a somewhat discouraging picture  home construction has continued to
decline and the fall in permits last month suggests that further declines are in store  consumer
spending appears to have slowed somewhat at the end of last year and seems to be carrying less
momentum into this quarter as the greenbook likes to put it  the december employment report
certainly was weak and has added considerably to fears of a recession  the greenbook forecast
just skirts the border of an outright recession  my own projection is fairly similar but a bit
weaker in the first half and with the weakness stretching out a bit longer this year  i am inclined
to see the bottom in housing as occurring later than in the greenbook which has housing starts
flattening out relatively soon and i am a bit less hopeful about business investment particularly
structures  i agree with the greenbook that the main effect of a stimulus package will be to shift
consumption growth from 09 to late 08 but that the effects are uncertain  i think the risks are
on the side of a smaller boost to spending though  but there is a chance that many ruleof
thumb consumers will find that their rule is telling them to pay down debt  in sum i expect very
weak growth in the first half of this year with only gradual recovery to trend  while i think weak
growth is the most likely scenario similar to president yellen i do think that a recession is a
quite distinct possibility this year  if that happens i think it will be due to a more sizable
pullback in nonresidential construction than we are expecting right now
turning to inflation it is hard to put a good face on the recent numbers  the greenbook
describes the recent upside surprise as transitory and expects inflation to diminish this year
indeed we have been getting some relief on retail gasoline prices in recent weeks  but i dont
think our problems with inflation are transitory and i dont want to lose sight of them in the
midst of the current weakness  if you look back over the past four years the overall pce price
index has averaged 2 percent  on a 12month basis the index has been below 2 percent only
four months in that span  now one could interpret this as a regime of 2 percent inflation with a
series of misses that happen to be virtually all on the plus side  alternatively you could view
this as a regime in which inflation fluctuates around a mean of 2 percent  market measures of
inflation expectations seem more consistent with the former right now  but the longer that
inflation averages well above 2 percent the more risk we run of seeing expectations rising to
match actual inflation rather than the other way around  another way to see this is that the
fragility we need to focus on now is our credibility  i mention all of this because it is why in my
economic projections this round i wrote down a relatively sluggish recovery after the first half
of this year  i am skeptical that we have seen nothing but positive inflation misses around a 2
percent trend for four years because of chance alone and i am not optimistic about inflation
coming down in a sustained way on its own  as a result i believe that in order to keep
expectations from drifting up and to bring inflation down we will need to raise rates later this
year even if that means a longer and slower recovery  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  you know listening to the staff discussion i
have certainly come to understand why everyone continues to believe that economics is a dismal
science  laughter  it is quite a dismal picture  but more seriously recent economic data have
certainly helped feed that view and the third district is no exception  economic activity has
weakened in our district since december and to double the fun firms continue to face
increasing price pressuresnot a very comfortable position for monetary policymakers  the
philadelphia staffs state coincident indicators indicate that overall economic activity has been
moderate in new jersey flat in pennsylvania and declining in delaware over the past three
months  our business outlook survey of manufacturers fell sharply in january  the index fell
to minus 209 from minus 16 in december  now some of that we have to remember is
sentiment in the sense that the question has to do with general activity and doesnt necessarily
reflect just their firm  but it is a sentiment of pessimism that certainly is more prevalent than it
once was  a reading that low of minus 20 indicates declining manufacturing activity in the
region and is usually associated with very low gdp growth or perhaps even negative gdp
growth at the national level  more related to the firms own performance though the surveys
indexes of new orders and shipments also declined in january and both are now in negative
territory although much less so than the general activity index
on the other hand while expectations of activity six months from now have moved down
somewhat this month they remain firmly in positive territory and firms capital spending plans
over the next six months remain relatively strong  district bankers are reporting weaker
consumer loan demand but business lending continues to advance at a moderate pace from their
perspective  loan quality has shown slight deterioration mainly in residential real estate and
auto loans to a lesser extent in credit cards and to an even lesser extent on the business loan
side  this downtick in quality follows a period of extraordinarily low delinquencies and default
rates and thus is well within historical norms so it has not greatly alarmed our banking
community  thus far our district banks apparently have largely escaped the credit problems
plaguing the larger money center banks and investment banks  while there has been some
tightening in credit conditions and standards around the district most nonrealestaterelated
firms i spoke with are not finding it difficult to obtain credit for any reasonable project they want
to do and so they have not identified largely with the credit crunch scenario
despite the softness in the activity firms in our district report higher prices in their
inputs and outputs  as president lacker said inflation seems to be alive and well  the current
pricespaid and pricesreceived indexes in our business outlook survey accelerated sharply in
january and are at very high levels almost record levels of the past twenty years  firms also
expect prices to rise over the next six months  these forwardlooking price indexes too are at
very elevated levels relative to their twentyyear history  i am hearing from business contacts
and from one of my directors for example that they are planning to implement price increases to
pass along costs they are experiencing  thus even though they are pessimistic about growth in
the future they are not pessimistic about price increases  this adds to my skepticism about
arguments that link inflation too closely with resource utilization
the national nearterm economic outlook is also deteriorating as we have been hearing
and i have revised down my growth forecast for 2008 compared with my october submission  it
is hard to find much positive news in the data released since our last meeting and the board staff
has summarized that quite eloquently and so i wont repeat them  nevertheless in general my
forecast is probably slightly less pessimistic than the boards forecast  however i must add that
at the same time that growth has slowed inflation has trended up  both the core cpi and the
core pce accelerated in the second half of 07 compared with the first half  the core cpi
advanced at a 26 percent rate in the second half of 07 compared with a 23 percent rate in the
first half and the core pce was up at a 24 percent rate in the second half compared with 19 in
the first half
as we know the pce price index gets revised  recent research by dean croushore one
of our visiting scholars has shown that between 1995 and 2005 the average revision from initial
release until the august release the following year was positive on average for both the core pce
and the total pce  this suggests that inflation is likely to be even higher in the second half of
07 than the current estimates indicate  i am also concerned that over the past 10 year period
core and headline inflation for both the pce and the cpi have diverged on average about
50 basis points  headline rates have exceeded core rates in 8 of the last 10 years for the cpi and
9 out of the last 10 years for the pce  while i would like to believe that these two rates should
be converging on average i am concerned that core rates may not be as indicative of underlying
trend inflation as we might have thought  this line of thinking also leads me to question
estimates of ex post real funds rates calculated by the staff and presented in the bluebook which
are based on subtracting core pce from the nominal funds rate  i am not convinced that the core
pce is the right measure of inflation in this context  even if you thought it was then the
reported real rates are likely to be overstated for recent quarters given the apparent systematic
bias in the preliminary estimates of the pce that i have noted before  moreover some measures
of inflation expectations are not encouraging  in particular the michigan survey oneyearahead
measures and fiveyearahead measures are up  we have already discussed a bit the acceleration
in some of the tips measures  i will return to that in a minute  the livingston survey
participants have also raised their forecast for cpi inflation in 2008 from 23 percent to 3
percent
my forecast overall is similar to the greenbooks and i expect a weak first half and a
return toward trend growth later this year and into 09 and inflation at the 17 to 2 percent range
but the policy assumptions that i make to achieve the forecasted outcomes for the intermediate
term are different from the greenbooks  the ongoing housing correction and poor credit market
conditions are a significant drag in the near term on the economy and i expect growth in the first
half of the year to be quite weak probably around 1 percent  as conditions in the housing and
financial markets begin to stabilize i expect economic growth to improve in the second half of
the year and move back toward trend which i estimate to be about 2 percent about 50 basis
points higher than the greenbook i think in 2009
the slowdown in real activity suggests a lower equilibrium real rate  how much lower is
difficult to measure with any precision  tenyear tips have fallen about 100 basis points since
the beginning of september  in such an environment optimal policy calls for the fomc to
allow the funds rate to fall as well  and we have the funds rate is down 175 basis points since
septemberor more if we cut today  but we also must remain committed to delivering on our
goal of price stability in this environment of rising prices  to my mind that means we must
continue to communicate that commitment to the markets and to act in a manner that is
consistent with that commitment  i want to stress that while many of us myself included have
argued that inflation expectations remain well anchored we cannot wait to act until we see
contrary evidence to such a claim because by then it will be too late and we will have already
lost some credibility  i also might add that the staff memo on inflation compensation which i
thought was very good suggests that one reason for the increase in forward inflation
compensation might be a greater inflation risk premium rather than a rise in expected inflation
that may in fact be true and i think the memo was very well done  but if that is the case if the
rise is in the inflation risk premium then i think it might be worth asking ourselves if the
increase in inflation uncertainty might be an early warning sign of our waning credibility
this perspective leads me to a different policy assumption from the greenbooks  in
particular once the real economy is stabilized the fomc must act aggressively to take back the
significant easing it has put in place in order to ensure that inflation is stabilized in 2010
employment is a lagging indicator so we will likely have to act before employment growth
returns to trend should output growth pick up in the second half of the year as forecasted  thus
i expect we will need to begin raising rates by the fourth quarter of this year and perhaps
aggressively so  in contrast the greenbook assumes a flat funds rate at 3 percent throughout the
forecast period  despite the real funds rate remaining below 1 percentand well after the
economy has returned to trend growthinflation expectations remain anchored in the
greenbook  in my view this seems somewhat implausible or at best a very risky bet  it
appears that the greenbook achieves this result through an output gaprelated to the question i
was asking earlier this afternoon  i think all of us understand the very real concerns that many
researchers have with our ability to accurately estimate the level of potential gdp  furthermore
in the recent research on inflation dynamics that we have discussedand president yellen was
referring to thisinflation becomes less persistent and appears to be less related to other
macroeconomic variables as well  we do not know whether these changes are an outcome of a
more aggressive and credible stance of monetary policy against inflation or are due to some
fundamental changes in the world economy  if the lower persistence is due to enhanced policy
credibility then it is incumbent upon this committee to maintain that credibility  otherwise we
cannot expect inflation persistence to remain low
thus if the economy performs as forecasted on the growth side with a return toward
trend growth in the second half i would be very uncomfortable leaving a real funds rate below
1 percent  the bluebook scenarios involving risk management indicate that the inflation
outcome is poor when there is a gradual reversal of policy  better outcomes are achieved under a
prompt reversal strategy  given that forecast i believe we must begin thinking now about what
our exit strategy from this insurance we have put in place is going to be  how we communicate
our monetary policy strategy will also be crucially important because of the effects such
communications will have on expectations  we need to better understand in our own minds i
think what our reaction function looks like so that we can be more systematic and articulate in
our implementation of policy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  in my view the decision we took on
january 21 reflected a broad consensus that economic fundamentals were weakening at a rapid
pace in an environment of continuing even heightened concern about financial market stress
and fragility  my contacts over this last week in the business and financial markets may add a
little texture to the picture on which we based our january 21 policy action  conversations with
these contacts in various industries provide information generally consistent with a downward
revision of the outlook  forwardlooking sentiment of the directors of the federal reserve bank
of atlanta turned decidedly pessimistic in january  retail contacts noted quite disappointing
results through midjanuary and are taking a conservative approach to 2008 in terms of hiring
and inventory  regarding the residential construction industry regional weakness continues and
is spreading from coastal markets to interior markets  in addition i had a conversation with the
ceo of a large public homebuilder of national scope  he cited historically high contract
cancellation rates especially on the west coast and the dc area because of the buyers
difficulty selling existing homes and getting financing  this limits their market to firsttime
buyers  his judgment is that a change in market atmosphere will require inventories falling to
around six months  he pointed out that the spring is traditionally the key season for sales so the
next several months will be particularly telling
weakness in the regions commercial real estate market appears to be spreading  the
retail segment is continuing to experience declining leasing activity and weakness is now
emerging in the warehouse and office markets as well  in partial contrast reports from the
manufacturing sector are more mixed  activity remains very weak in housingrelated industries
one ceo reflecting the concern of others predicted business failures in lumberyards and
construction supply firms because of excess capacity and the slow response to a lower building
environment  the trucking sector continues to slump  however industries related to oil and gas
production importsubstituting industries such as steel aerospace and defense and the foreign
brand auto sector are all performing quite well  atlantas national forecast is largely consistent
with the greenbook in direction and our differences with the greenbook in magnitude and
timing are not material  like the greenbook we premise our forecast on a lower funds rate at
the level of 3 percent
so the principal risk to the forecast in my view is the fragility of the financial markets
uncertainty and fear continue to loom large  i made a number of calls to financial market
players and my counterparts cited a variety of concerns relevant to overall financial stability
for instance one of the recent concerns as bill dudley depicted has been the situation of the
monoline credit insurers  several of my contacts had comments but i spoke to the newly
appointed interim ceo of one of the two monoline insurance firms most prominent in the news
and he characterized the firms solvency and liquidity fundamentals as in question only toward
the far end of current independent forecasts of subprime losses  perhaps predictably he
contrasted his assessment with what he views as alarmist atmospherics resulting from press
coverage quixotic rating agency actions and state regulator political positioning  a regional
banks cfo cautioned that more data on actual mortgage performance in 2007 will soon be
available and that could force restatements in 2007 bank earnings  commenting on market
illiquidity one source said that in some fixedincome markets where many on the buy side
currently depend on moderate leverage to achieve the required rates of return banks have greatly
reduced their lending  he also indicated that even though there are real money investorsas he
called theminterested in return to the structuredfinance securities markets but currently on the
sidelines they are reluctant to expose themselves to volatility that arises under marktomarket
accounting using prices set in such illiquid markets  these anecdotal inputs simply point to the
continuing uncertainty and risk to financial stability with some potential i think for selffeeding
hysteria
i share with my colleagues on the committee worries about the heightened levels of
inflation and uncertainties around my working forecast that inflation will moderate in 2008  the
assumptions about energy prices are the most precarious  nevertheless i am prepared to take the
position that the economy with its apparently rapid deceleration compounded by continuing
financial volatility is a greater concern than inflation at this juncture  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  let me talk a bit about the region  the
tenth district is generally moving forward at a fairly steady pace but there are some mixed data
the obvious wide variances are in real estate  housing is weaknot as weak as some parts of
the country but still weak  also it is interesting that commercial real estate in each of our major
cities right now continues to do well  i recently talked with several developers  they are all
doing well but are very concerned and they are beginning to cut back on their plans and move
away from them  so you can see the worry carrying forward in terms of what actions they are
taking  in the agricultural area and in the energy area real estate is a different story  it is
booming  land values have gone up in the ag partnonirrigated land something like
20 percent over the past year  if you are near an ethanol plant it has gone up 25 to 30 percent  it
is also interesting that the ag credit system is helping to fund that  their increase in lending was
about 12 percent this past year  that is up from about 9 percent the year before so they are
providing that  they are also now involved in lending to these ethanol plants in a very
significant way helping to carry that boom forward  that gives me some pause in terms of what
is going on in some of the rural areas  related to that the energy and lease values are also
accelerating at a fairly high rate  i found it reminiscent and somewhat disturbing in talking to a
couple of individuals when they noted that the land values have about doubled over the past two
or three years in some areas and they said that i should relax because on current ag prices they
should have tripled  laughter  where have i seen that before
on the other side actually manufacturing in our region has held steady  we have a lot of
aircraft manufacturing which is really strong and some other smaller manufacturers providing
support in both ag and energy and they seem to be doing well  technology is also doing well in
the region especially in the mountain areasthe colorado and denver areas  engineering firms
are still very strongthe strong demand for engineers and the unfilled positions continue  they
are supplying that service across the globe and see continued demand there  so it is mixed but
overall probably our region is doing better than average relative to the rest of the nation
on the national level my projections suggest that we are going to grow below our
potential growth rate  i am not as pessimistic as the greenbook  i also have inflation coming
down but that is on the assumption that we are able to reverse our monetary policy at a fairly
quick pace as we move through this year and into 2009  i will leave it there  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  let me talk about the economic outlook  my
initial comments are organized kind of along the lines of dave reifschneiders exhibit 1  there
are certainly still some positive things going on  growth in exports and i think that is likely to
continue strength in the agricultural sector and in natural resources in general outside of lumber
and wood products state and local construction spendingthere seem to be a lot of schools
hospitals sports stadiums et cetera being built now and the labor market may be a bit better
than the december household and payroll surveys depicted given the low level of initial claims
but i think those considerations are really overwhelmed by several factors on the
negative side and let me summarize those quickly  first is the breadth of the negative news on
the national economy that we have received recently  the vast bulk of the news has been
negative  it doesnt suggest to me that there is a lot of positive momentum or latent strength left
in the economy  the second factor i would citeand this is not newis the persistence of a
large volume of unsold unoccupied houses with implications for activity in that sector for
prices for wealth and for foreclosures  of course as somebody already noted many recessions
turn out to be inventory recessions  if we have one this will be an inventory recession too and
the inventory in question is housing  third maybe even more important are the financial
conditions themselvesprominently but not exclusively the impaired capital positions of large
banks and likely prospects for growing credit quality problems in auto loans in credit cards in
commercial real estate and perhaps in other areas as well  adding up those considerations i
think what we confront resembles the aftermath of the 199091 recession when socalled
headwinds restrained growth in real gdp and my forecast anticipates something similar going
forward something like the persistent weakness scenario in the latest greenbook  so i expect
subpar growth both this year and next year before better growth resumes in 2010  i further
expect lots of inertia in both core and overall measures of inflation this year and next before
some diminution below 2 percent in 2010  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  first mr chairman i want to say a good word about president poole  i
have sat next to him since i got here  i would give him hyperbolic praise if he hadnt handed me
the it oversight committee otherwise i think he is a wonderful human being  laughter
much of what i was going to say has been said  i think president plosser president lacker and
others have summarized what i would have said about my own district  we continue to grow
but at a decelerated pace and our current forecast is for employment growth of 2 percent for our
district for 2008  that is relatively healthy and i really am not going to take more time on that
subject
i am delighted to hear all this anecdotal evidence  we were talking governor mishkin
and i about woody allen earlier  if i remember correctly he had a wonderful quipthat he
cheated on his metaphysics exam by looking into another boys soul  laughter  basically
what we are doing at this time of transition is almost cheating on the data by looking at the
anecdotal evidence  my broader ceo soundings indicate pretty much the same as what we are
seeing in our district and what others have mentionedshipping rail express delivery
manufacturing and other activities are much slower  retail sales are soft  as president poole
and others pointed out truckers are suffering  receivables are being stretched out
delinquencies are rising  i could bore you with specifics company by company as i am tempted
to do but i will not unless you wish me to  the point is that while there are tales of woe none
of the 30 ceos to whom i talked outside of housing see the economy trending into negative
territory  they see slower growth  some of them see much slower growth  none of them at this
juncturethe cover of newsweek notwithstanding a great contraindicator which by the way
shows the road to recession on the issue that is about to come outsee us going into recession
i will just give you two indicators there  if you look at mastercard and dig into their data their
december retail sales exauto exgas were up 5 percent and in january to date were up 4
percent  president poole mentioned ups and president lockhart has the incoming ceo of ups
on his board  year over year to january they are up 2 percent  so it is anemic  it is not
negative  the expectation is not to be negative  my ceo soundings indicate pretty much what
we have forecast as a groupmuch slower growth not necessarily a recession
where the difference comes mr chairman is on the inflation front  others have spoken
eloquently about inflation  i just want to make a couple of comments here  it is uncanny in the
charts that we show in exhibit 5 for example that we have food pce prices and energy pce
prices peaking almost as we speak  that may be true in the spot markets  that is not the way it
works in reality  att has 100000 trucks  southwest airlines has i dont know how many
airplanes  they contract and hedge out forward their energy costs and the kickin of any
turndown does not occur immediately but rather is stretched out over a time period  i would ask
our staff as we go forward to try to get a better feeling for that  we are certainly struggling
with that in dallas  as far as food prices are concerned which again i remind you are twice the
weight of energy prices in the headline pce and the cpi i heard some very disturbing news
fritolay for example which when we last met i reported was going to increase prices
3 percent has inched them up another 3 percent to 6 percent and that is their planning for the
year  this is the first time in memory according to my contacts that grocery prices are rising
faster than restaurant food  yet it is not simply food where we are seeing this kind of pressure
and i want to come back to the lag effect that occurs  this morning the ceo of burlington
northern told me that the socalled rail adjustment factor which captures fuel labor supply and
other costs from the previous quarter and is contractually input into contracts for the coming
quarter rose at the highest rate in history11 percent  that means that even if you are shipping
lumber even if you are shipping whatever goes into housing by contractof course that can be
negotiated i am surefor the coming quarter the price rise from the shippers the railers will be
11 percent  finally going back to food and other items bought by consumerswhen you drill
down deep into walmart which has 127 million customers and you talk about the specifics of
their sales their expansion is not coming from unit sales it is coming from price inflation  a
senior official there tells me that they are budgeting a 2 to 3 percent increase for nonfood items
for 08 6 to 7 percent for food items  it is the first time in his fifteenyear history at the
company that they are going to use their price leadership strategy on the plus side of the inflation
ledger  so i do worry about inflation expectations mr chairman  i will summarize with the
statement that was in todays new york times by the ceo of tyson foods who said because
of the unanticipated high corn and soybean meal costs we have no choice but to raise prices
substantially  that is my major concern besides the additional weakness we are seeing in the
economy  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  my assessment of the national economy is
that we are in the midst of a period of very weak growth and that there is a significant chance of
a serious downturn  the threemonth average of our chicago fed national activity index in
december was minus 067  historically by my calculation such a value has been associated
with a recession about 70 percent of the time  now in the board briefings yesterday and again
today i noticed that thomas laubachs estimate is 45 percent based on the same data and that is
certainly large enough for concern
reports from my business contacts seem broadly consistent with this slow but positive
growth scenario  the most positive news i received was from firms whose international
businesses were strong  as one would expect the most dire reports were from those in
residential construction and related industries  while i was surprised to hear from the ceo of a
national specialty retail chain that its business over the past 60 days was the worst he has seen in
45 years much of his business is in housewares and furniture but he indicated that many other
segments of the retail sector were also struggling  i also spoke with the ceo of general motors
his outlook was a lot like what president fisher was just mentioning from other ceos  they are
looking for slow economic growth overall and they are concerned about the risk of a serious
downturn  that is not what they are planning on  the industry is clearly facing softer demand
but his expectation for 2008 as a whole is for only a moderate decline in light motor vehicle
sales down to a pace of about 15 million units  gms current production plans are not
premised on recessionlevel sales but they are prepared to cut production quickly if they see the
economy turning down  he also reported that while the performance of gmacs auto loans
currently was okay the credit quality of prospective buyerspeople coming into showrooms
has declined and that lenders have tightened underwriting standards for those loans  in addition
if auto loans became more difficult to securitize it would be a big additional problem
apparently so far they are robust though
turning to the forecast details my modal outlook for 2008 is close to that in the
greenbook  i expect that we will eke out positive growth in the first half of 2008  this
expectation largely reflects the judgment that businesses have not begun to ratchet down
spending plans in the nonlinear fashion that characterizes a recession  my assessment also has
been influenced by some positive developments that we have seen  the most notable ones in my
mind are that ui claims have moved down that major banks are having some success raising
capital from a variety of sources and that the orders data today were better  for the second half
of 2008 i see growth increasing toward potential by yearend  this assessment depends
importantly on accommodative monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy  our cumulative
actions following this meeting should provide noticeable stimulus to the economy by midyear
tax rebates should also help somewhat this year  in addition the financial system should
continue to sort through its difficulties making further headway in price discovery and repairing
capital positions  so in the absence of further negative developments growth should improve in
the second half of this year  i then see real gdp rising at a pace a bit above potential in 2009
although this seems like a plausible projection it has the feel of threading the needle
which brings to mind nimbleness and governor kohn is our expert at nimbleness so i start
thinking about how his nimble fingers will be critical for threading this needle  the downside
risks are large and the recession scenarios are quite possible  any of the factors currently
holding back growth could intensify  for example a reduction in bank lending capacity could
make financial conditions much more restrictive  this along with increased business pessimism
and caution could cause a more pronounced cutback in investment and hiring  even a
moderately weaker job market would add to the factors already weighing on consumer spending
now unfortunately even while we are dealing with concerns on the growth front the
inflation picture is difficult and quite uncertain  the inflation outlook will likely be affected by
more crosscurrents than usual  headline inflation has been quite high driven largely by
increasingly high energy food and commodity prices  although our best assessment is that
these pressures will come off later this year these influences have lasted longer than typical and
could well continue to do so  i had calculated the same type of statistics that president plosser
calculated but only since 1999  headline pce inflation has been running about 04 percentage
point higher than core pce since that time  this is a source of some concern and cautions us
against relying too heavily on core inflation measures  i dont think that is a big issue today but
we need to be thinking about that in our inflation strategy  in addition core inflation has not
improved as much as i expected  as the greenbook discusses the decline during the second
quarter of last year may have reflected technical quirks in the indexes rather than true
improvements in underlying inflation as i had hoped  the weakening us economy is likely to
diminish inflation pressures somewhat in 2008 but it is unclear how big a factor this will be or
given our projection that growth improves how long it will last  so i think that inflation risk
will be rising next year  consequently recalibration of shortterm interest rates will be an
important element of monetary policy in 2009  looking at the writeup it seemed to me as
though 10 out of 17 participants had that viewpointdifferent timing  our inflation projection
has core pce running 21 percent in 2008 and edging off to 2 percent by 2010  in the context of
what brian was talking about in terms of slack we have a higher inflation path and inflation
coming down with a bit of slack  much of the committees discussion today has suggested that
2 percent is slightly higher than most participants benchmarks  for me the trajectory of my
outlook is satisfactory as long as i see inflation prospects continuing to improve as we move
beyond the end of our current forecast period  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  in my view economic conditions have
deteriorated significantly since our december meeting  taken as a whole the stories that have been
relayed to me by my fourth district business contacts have been downbeat and several of the
contacts are concerned that we may be slipping into a recession  im hearing that consumer
spending has declined appreciably since the soft december retail sales numbers were reported  the
cfo of one of the nations major department store chains told me last week that her companys
january sales are shaping up to be the worst that they have seen in the past twenty years  she said
that they had already cut back some of their buying plans because of the weak holiday sales but
after seeing the numbers for the first three weeks of january she is concerned that they have not cut
back buying plans enough  in december i had heard some upbeat assessments about the demand
for capital goods and exports but in january the incoming numbers are softer and expectations for
the coming year are less optimistic than they were just a month ago
im also concerned that im now detecting the first signals of a credit crunch  bankers in
my district tell me that theyre finding it much more difficult to issue debt and that they are
safeguarding their capital  ive heard several motivations for this depending on the institution
some bankers are simply preparing for further losses  some are expecting to have to bring some
downgraded assets back onto their balance sheets  even those bankers who have adequate capital
say that they have become much more disciplined about how theyre going to allocate that capital
collectively the concerns that bankers have expressed to me about capital have convinced me that
credit will be less available and more expensive than it has been in quite a while  deals that bankers
would have done for creditworthy borrowers not long ago are simply not being done today  of
course its possible that nonbank financial companies will step in and fill the gap but it is not clear
to me that they have the capital and the risk appetites to do so
these developments have had a significant influence on the economic projection that i
submitted for todays meeting  like many around the table i continue to mark down my outlook
for residential and nonresidential investment in response to the incoming data and also in response
to greater business pessimism about the economic prospects  in addition ive built in a sharper and
more protracted slowing in consumer spending stemming from greater deterioration in the
household balance sheet and tighter credit market conditions  these adjustments have caused me to
cut my 2008 gdp growth projection about 1 percentage point since the december meeting and
some of that weakness spills over to the out years  if credit conditions deteriorate further than i
have expected then my projection would more closely resemble the persistent weakness alternative
scenario described in the greenbook  but that isnt my projection for the economy  rather my
projection is roughly in line with the greenbook baseline
my inflation outlook hasnt changed much from where it was in decemberor october for
that matter  like the greenbook i still project inflation to moderate as commodity prices level off
and business activity wanes but the risks to my inflation outlook have shifted to being weighted to
the upside  the december cpi report was not much improved from the troubling november data
and my business contacts continue to report that commodity prices are being passed downstream
so i have less conviction in the inflation moderation than i did a month ago  that said the
downside risks to the economy still dominate my thinking about the outlook today  i do believe
however that our policy response to date combined with an additional rate cut tomorrow will allow
the economy to regain some momentum as we move into the second half of 2008  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  the contours of our forecast are broadly
in line with the greenbook  growth well below potential for the first half of this year results in
additional slack in labor markets with a consequent reduction in the core rate of inflation over time
our forecast returns to full employment by 2010 only if we reduce interest rates more than they are
in the greenbook  thus our baseline forecast assumes that we reduce rates 50 basis points at this
meeting followed by additional easing in 2008 which eventually results in core inflation below
2 percent and the unemployment rate settling at our estimate of the nairu somewhat below
5 percent  but even with this easing there are significant downside risks to this forecast
historically increases in unemployment in excess of 06 percent and forecasts of two or more
quarters of real gdp growth below 2 percent have almost always been followed by a recession  in
fact a variety of probit models looking at the probability of recession in 2008 indicate an
uncomfortably high probability of recession in most cases above 50 percent
several factors make me concerned that the outlook could be worse than our baseline
forecast  first we have consistently underestimated weakness in residential investment  while our
forecast assumes a gradual decline in real estate prices it does not have a substantial feedback
between rising unemployment rates causing further downward pressure on real estate prices and the
health of financial institutions  were we to reach a tipping point of higher unemployment higher
home foreclosures increased financial duress and falling housing prices we would likely have to
ease far more than if we were to act preemptively to insure against this risk  second our weak
consumption is driven by negative wealth effects induced by weakness in equity markets and
modest declines in real estate prices  however the heightened discussion of a potential recession
could easily result in a larger pullback by consumers  this would be consistent with the behavior of
rates on credit default swaps of major retailers which have risen significantly since the middle of
december  third banks are seeing increasing problems with credit card debt  capital one one of
the few concentrated credit card lenders has had their credit default swap rate rise from less than
100 basis points to more than 400 basis points as investors have become increasingly concerned
about the retail sector  while liquidity concerns have abated credit risk for financial institutions has
grown  rates on credit default swaps for our largest banks have been rising since december
despite the announcement of additional equity investments  in addition the greatest concern i hear
raised by the financial community in boston is a risk posed by the monoline guarantors  the
movement in equity prices last week as a result of highly speculative statements on resolving the
monoline problem indicates a sensitivity of the markets to significant further deterioration in the
financial position of the monolines  fourth our model does not capture potential credit crunch
problems although supplementary empirical analysis conducted by the boston staff suggests that
such problems pose additional downside risks to our outlook  bank balance sheets continue to
expand as banks act in their traditional role of providing liquidity during economic slowdowns
while the balance sheet constraints are likely to be most acute at our largest institutions further
deterioration in real estate markets is likely to crimp smaller and midsize banks that have significant
real estate exposures
given my concerns that we could soon be or may already be in a recession i believe the
risks around our forecast of core inflation settling below 2 percent are well balanced  inflation rates
have fallen in previous recessions and i expect that historical regularity to be maintained if growth
is as slow as i expect  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  let me just start by saying
its not all dark  laughter
mr mishkin  dont worry be happy
vice chairman geithner  im going to end dark but its not all dark  the world
still seems likely to be a source of strength  you know we have the implausible kind of goldilocks
view of the world which is its going to be a little slower taking some of the edge off inflation risk
without being so slow that its going to amplify downside risks to growth in the united states  that
may be too optimistic but the world still is looking pretty good  central banks in a lot of places are
starting to soften their link to the dollar so that they can get more freedom to direct monetary policy
to respond to inflation pressure  thats a good thing  us external imbalances are adjusting at a
pace well ahead of expectations  thats all good i think  as many people pointed out the fact that
we dont have a lot of imbalances outside of housing coming into this slowdown is helpful  theres
a little sign of incipient optimism on the productivity outlook or maybe a little less pessimism that
were in a much slower structural productivity growth outlook than before  the market is building
an expectation for housing prices that is very very steep  that could be a source of darkness or
strength but some people are starting to call the bottom ahead and thats the first time  it has been
a long time since weve seen any sense that maybe the turn is ahead  it seems unlikely but maybe
theyre right
in the financial markets i think it is true that there is some sign that the process of repair is
starting  we have seen very very substantial adjustment by the major financial institutions very
very substantial deleveraging ahead as the institutions adjust to this much much greater increase in
macroeconomic uncertainty and downside risk very very substantial early equity raising by major
firms pretty substantial improvement in market functioning and easing of liquidity pressure
those are useful encouraging things  there is a huge amount of uncertainty about the size and the
location of remaining credit losses across the system  but based on what we know i think its still
true that the capital positions of the major us institutions coming into this look pretty good relative
to how they did in the early 1990s  of course as many people have said many times theres a fair
amount of money in the world willing and able to come in when investors see prices at sufficiently
distressed levels  one more encouraging sign of course is that the timing content and design of
the stimulus package look as though the package will be a modest positive  it could have been a
worse balance of lateness and poor design but i think it looks to be above expectations on both
timing and design and it will help a little on the downside and take out some of the downside risk
having said that though i think it is quite dark still out there    like everyone else we have
revised down our growth forecast  we expect very little growth if any in the first half of the year
before policy starts to bring growth back up to potential  the main risk as has been true since
august is the dangerous selfreinforcing cycle in which tighter financial conditions hurt confidence
and raise recession probability causing people to behave on the expectation that recession probably
is higher reinforcing the financial headwinds et cetera  the dominant challenge to policy is still to
arrest that dynamic and reduce the probability of the very adverse outcome on the growth side  of
course we have to do that without risking too much damage to our inflation credibility and too
much damage to future incentives and future resource allocation
like many of you i think the inflation outlook for the reasons laid out in the greenbook is
better than it was  its not terrific but its better  the risks are probably balanced around the
inflation outlook  our inflation forecast still has core pce coming down below 2 percent over the
forecast period  theres obviously a lot of uncertainty around that but i really think that you can
look at inflation expectations in the markets as somewhat reassuring on the credibility front to date
so again i think the key question for policy is how low we should get real shortterm rates relative
to equilibrium and our best judgment is that were going to have to get them lower even with
another 50 basis points tomorrow  were still going to need to try to reinforce the signal that were
going to provide an adequate degree of accommodation or insurance against this very dangerous
risk of a selfreinforcing cycle in which financial weakness headwinds reinforce the risk of a much
deeper and prolonged decline in economic activity
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you  thank you vice chairman geithner for a little less gloom here
i didnt expect the bright side from that source  laughter  like everyone else around the table i
have revised down my forecast which looks very much like the greenbook  a couple of quarters of
very slow growth before a pickup in the second half of the year spurred by monetary and fiscal
stimulus  the collapse of the housing market has been at the center of the slowdown and most
recent information was weaker than expected  there is no sign in the data anyhow that a bottoming
out is in sight  sales of new homes have dropped substantially and that must reflect reduced
availability of credit especially for nonprime and prime nonconforming loans and perhaps buyers
expectations of further price declines  as a consequence a steep drop in housing construction has
made only a small dent in inventories and those will continue to weigh on activity and prices
indeed houseprice declines in the caseshiller index picked up late last year  i think we just got
november
it looks increasingly as though other sectors are being affected as well slowing from the
earlier pace of expansion and slowing a little more than expected  you can see this in broad
measures of activity as president stern pointed out  industrial production purchasing manager
surveys and the employment report  i think it is also evident in some measures of demand  retail
sales data suggest a deceleration in consumer spending late in the fourth quarter  orders and
shipments for capital equipment excluding aircraft picked up in december but that followed a
couple of months of flat or declining data  a slowdown in consumption and nonhousing investment
probably reflects multiplieraccelerator effects of the drop in housing a decline in housing wealth
and additional caution by both businesses and households given the highly uncertain and possibly
weakening economic outlook  certainly the anecdotes weve heard around the table reinforce the
sense of business caution
but like other people i see the softening outlook and the spread beyond the housing sector
as importantly a function of whats going on in the financial sector and of the potential interaction of
that over time with spending  we have seen improvements in shortterm funding markets in
spreads and in the leveling out of the abcp assetbacked commercial paper outstandings but
investors and lenders seem increasingly concerned about the broader economic weakness and
spreading repayment problems and they are demanding much greater compensation for taking risk
in nearly every sector  to me one of the defining characteristics of the period since say mid
november is the spreading out from the housing sector of lending caution to other sectors in the
economy  nonfinancial corporations have experienced declines in equity prices  credit spreads on
both investmentgrade and junk bonds have increased  a substantial portion of banks reported
tightening terms and standards for ci loans  commercial real estate sector lenders are very
concerned about credit  spreads on cmbs have risen substantially and most bankslike
80 percenttightened up on commercial real estate credit and that has to affect spending in that
sector over time  banks tell us that they are being more cautious about extending consumer credit
as president yellen noted  a number of large banks noted a pullback in this area and deterioration
in actual and expected loan performance when they announced their earnings over the past few
weeks  there have also been increasing doubts about how robust foreign economies will remain
and this was evident in equity markets around the globe and in rising risk spreads on emerging
market debt  the staff has marked down its forecast of foreign gdp growth again this round  the
total decrease in projected foreign growth in 2008 since last august has been around  percentage
point and this is at a time when we are counting on exports to support economic activity
the extraordinary volatility in markets is i think indicative of underlying uncertainty and
that underlying uncertainty itself will discourage risktaking  the uncertainty and the caution are
partly feeding off the continued decline in housing the stillunknown extent of the losses that will
need to be absorbed and the extent to which those losses are eroding the capital of key institutions
like the monolines  the monoline issue raises questions about who will bear the losses and provides
another channel for problems spreading through the credit markets through losses being felt or
credit being taken back on bank balance sheets making them more cautious and even more
directly into the muni market through the monolines  despite these developments my forecast for
2008 was revised down only a few tenths from october  but that is because of the considerable
easing of monetary policy undertaken and assumed in my forecast  i assumed 50 at this meeting
and unlike that piker president yellen i assumed another 50 over the second quarter
ms yellen  ill see you and up you  laughter
mr kroszner  this is a bad dynamic
mr kohn  i thought we needed some insurance and i also assumed some fiscal stimulus
as in the greenbook  i still see despite these policy responses risks around my outlook for activity
as skewed to the downside and its because of the potential further increases in required
compensation for risk and tightening standards for extending credit and the feedback on demand
although inflation has been running higher than expected of late and that is troubling i
expect it to ease back even with my more accommodative policy  the combination weve seen of
slower income growth and higher inflation suggests elements of a supply shock and thats
obviously coming from the energy sector and its spillover into food  it is true as president fisher
pointed out that some of those increases in food and energy prices are coming from demand from
emergingmarket economies but to the extent that such demand is putting upward pressure on our
prices and its not really sucking exports from the united states at any great rate i think that it acts
more like a supply shock on the us economy than a demand shock  energy and other commodity
prices should level off in an environment of slower global growth and theyve started to do that
they have at least showed signs of leveling off recently  greater slack in resource utilization and
product markets should discipline increases in costs and prices  at least some of the reports about
airlines suggest that they have tried to pass through fuel surcharges and have been unable to do so
and i think thats an encouraging sign from the inflation perspective  any easing of inflation
pressure does require that inflation expectations not begin to ratchet higher  i agree with everyone
else  im persuaded that the balance of evidence is that they have not despite the rise in fiveyear
forward inflation compensation and despite the persistently higher rate of increases of total headline
than of core inflation  but this is something we will need to monitor very carefully  i interviewed
paul volcker yesterday afternoon for our oral history project  the discussion with him reminded
me again of the high cost of reversing a rise in inflation once higher inflation expectations become
entrenched  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i will endeavor to stay out of the growing
creeping pessimism caucus  laughter  you can judge for yourselves whether ive been successful
doing so  let me talk briefly about two economies that are in a tugofwar and rather than
reference the housing and nonhousing economies let me try to talk about it in the context of the
economy of financial services versus the real economy  on one level of course financial services
are not so large a share of gdp that they could threaten the macroeconomy  but the transmission
mechanism between credit markets and the real economy whether it be through the credit channel
or other channels while imperfectly understood is having very negative effects on the cost and
availability of credit for real businesses and households with the risks there to the downside
financial institutions as many of you said are open for business but i would say somewhat less so
than when we met in december  as we approach the credit line renewal season that is happening
amid a period of depleted credit availability and significantly tighter lending standards  in addition
financial institutions as a group are in my view undercapitalized even with the recent capital
infusions  finally the dynamism that i would be hoping to see among financial institutions is
clearly lacking and while i think as president pianalto referenced that there are new market
entrants like hedge funds that are pretty keen to provide mezzanine financing its a pretty slow
process to match providers and users of capital  so at least for the nearterm forecast i wouldnt
expect that to come much to our rescue
if the us financial institutions were an economy all to themselves they would probably
already be in a recession  while that doesnt necessarily equate to a recession for the broader
economy it sure doesnt help  the repair process that president geithner referenced among
financial institutions strikes me as very fragile and quite incomplete  income statement shortfalls
due to falling profits poor visibility weaker pipelines and the need to reduce headcounts very
meaningfully strike me in some ways as a more urgent and troublesome issue for large financial
institutions than their balance sheet weakness  on the balance sheet front however im also
concerned that more impairments are to come for large financial institutions and more dilution is
expected for current shareholders  although the window for foreign investment is open now i
wouldnt expect that window to stay open throughout 2008  so even though id say that income
statement concerns should be more pressing for them these balance sheet issues are very real  in
some way these institutions have been built or i should say rebuilt over the past six years to
prepare themselves for a low volatility high liquidity world and what they found is the exact
opposite  they are at different levels of understanding the new world and it will take them quite
some time to rebuild their businesses to be profitable in it
rolling capital calls across financial institutions are continuing  many are hoping to play for
time but i think theres a risk that time will run away from them as new events find their way into
the front pages  virtually no financial institution strikes me as immune to these pressures and while
we see that new problems and new acronyms are emerging daily they strike me as having the same
underlying problems affecting different asset classes  regional banks have begun to fund their
balance sheets successfullycertainly a good signbut i suspect that they are also in the early
stages of needing to raise considerably more capital
as governor kohn said there is a hope and an expectation that global institutions would be
a source of strength at least in financial services  again in financial services my sense is that non
us financial institutions especially those in the united kingdom and europe are in the midst of
playing catchup to their us counterparts  i expect the yearend reporting process for them which
really begins now but will be at full speed by midfebruary through early march will find many of
the landesbanks needing to be recapitalized  i think were going to find that both large and small
institutions are having a hard time getting through the bank reporting season in europe  equity
prices in europe and cds spreads are already giving us some indication of whats on the horizon
its not just about subprime in europe contrary to some of the indications we received  perhaps
even more than us institutions many european financial institutions have incorrectly believed that
high credit ratings across asset classes would in and of themselves serve as protection  the
overreliance on credit ratings that we see in the united states strikes me as even more pronounced
in europe  the shocks caused by these financial institutions could have a dramatic impact on their
economies probably more so than the effect of us financial institutions here in the united states
that obviously has a consequence in terms of a further shock and also a consequence on the real
side in terms of us exports
let me turn to the other side of that that is the real economy itself excluding financials  i
think many of you referred to the labor market data which strike me as mixed  im perhaps a touch
more optimistic that were going to see some improvement at least in the short term there but i
cant have the conviction that id like  the real economy is doing its best to resist these financial
shocks  we can see that fight playing out around es spending around business fixed investment
and around capex more generally  you have nonfinancials with strong corporate balance sheets
excess cash and high profit levels that are debating in corporate boards about the uncertainty posed
by the macroeconomy  its hard to say which side is going to prevail in that battle  the backdrop
as many of you mentioned has weakened with risk premiums widening across the board  real
pce for january is not showing much of a snapback from a weak december but also i would say
not much more deterioration from december levels according to the credit card companies that i
spoke to  the bottom line on the real economythe trends in the real economy may be a bit more
positive coming into the first quarter from the fourth quarter than the greenbook projections but i
would say i am a little less optimistic that the fiscal stimulus package is as likely to be as
constructive as the greenbook would have us believe
the forecast as a result overall depends on the ability of nonfinancial corporations to hire
and invest despite this macroeconomic uncertainty  i have some confidence that the fortune 500
will be willing to continue to push along this path of moderate growth but small companies
particularly those that are really the source of job creation may be more negatively affected while
the credit channel is impaired and this is happening at a critical time  the greenbook base case or
the faster recovery pace depends to a degree on improvement in credit intermediation or at least
not another shock and its that other shock that worries me  if deterioration among credit
intermediaries continues the real economy will suffer  of course the correlation is hard to pin
down
finally on the inflation front i share the concerns expressed by several of you that the
persistence of recent inflation information coming into this period is a cause for concern  im less
sanguine than the greenbook that were going to see the power of that inflation fade in the event
that the economy softens some  the backdrop of stubbornly high commodity prices despite lower
global demand in recent weeks and a lower exchange value of the dollar are likely to put pressure
on the inflation front  the data as we have all talked about on core and total inflation are not
promising so i would consider that also to be an upside risk  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  well if thats the optimistic scenario i think we
had all better pray  but i think its a relatively balanced scenario that accurately reflects the risks
that are there  the greenbook has done a very good job of trying to thread the needle and i think
making a close call for contraction but not actually calling it seems to be very reasonable  the
kinds of insurance discussions in both the greenbook and the bluebook and that weve had
preliminarily here make a lot of sense  our models have never been successful at assessing turning
points and that is true whether they are the typical linear models nonlinear models probit models
markov switching models or other things like that  we sort of know once weve switched but its
hard to get that transition  as many people have suggested there are an awful lot of indicators that
would go into those kinds of models that would flash for contraction being likely  i think that is
correct but that makes it very difficult for us to assess what will happen  so i thinkas well
reflected in the projectionsa lot of downside risk is there
i do share some of the optimism about improvements that weve seen in the financial
markets but i had that feeling in october and november and it is hard for me to really understand
exactly what drove the subsequent deterioration  certainly there were some issues around yearend
but it seems that more issues than just the yearend were driving the fairly significant reversal of
improvement that occurred during october through midnovember and the fairly sudden backing
up  so im concerned that since i dont really understand what happened there i dont want to take
too much comfort from what has happened so far  but i also dont want to dismiss what has
happened so far because its certainly conceivable that things will move in a more linear way
forward for improvement
one issue that i raised both at the last fomc and in our various conference calls related to
some discussions ive had with the major credit card companies which in some sense have a very
good feeling for realtime consumption  ive talked with two major credit card companies and they
both had very negative views of what had happened in the very sharp transition consistent with a
switch into a contractionary state from the discussions before the october fomc versus before the
december fomc  but in the most recent discussions basically it flattened out  its certainly not
recovering but it is not a continuing downward trend which at least in my view provides a great
deal of comfort because i was very concerned about the nonlinear break to a very low consumption
state and i think theres less evidence of that  i wont go through the specifics of what they said
but basically were still seeing challenges and increases in personal bankruptcies slower repayment
rates more people slipping from 30 days overdue to 60 days overdue et cetera et cetera  but its
not as dramatic a change and its sort of within the range that they have been anticipating given the
data from december  also as someone mentioned and i have forgotten who these numbers are
still at relatively low levels  now the change is in a very bad direction and certainly could move
very quickly and weve seen that in other recession scenarios  but fortunately it seems at least
from this anecdotal evidence that it isnt a significant change to the downside and its possible that
it could just be reflattening out  my concern is still that sort of slow burn scenario that ive
talked about and that nellie and others have fleshed out on the pressures on banks balance sheets  i
liked nellies very politically correct phrase unplanned asset expansions  thats a very nice way
of putting like oh my goodness something is suddenly on the balance sheet that we didnt
expectsivs assetbacked commercial paper and so forth  i think people are still waiting for the
other shoe to drop and the other shoe certainly could drop  there may be things that we havent
fully anticipated but we know that there are still leveraged loans that they cant get off their books
a pipeline thats still coming on  we know that many banks are still making mortgage loans and
cannot get those off their booksat least the jumbo ones  its conceivable that raising the limits at
freddie mac and fannie mae may help in the short run even if there may be costs in the longer run
a number of other things could suddenly come on the balance sheets  the example of what
happened at socgen is just another uncertainty that could be out there  so even at a major financial
institution that was generally quite well respected something like this could happen  a lot of finger
pointing and a lot of uncertainty can come from that and thats broadly reflected in the cds
spreads  about the point that bill dudley made in conversation with president rosengren about
being careful to say well cds spreads are lower in europe and that suggests theres less risk in
europeyou have to take into account the reaction function by the governments by the regulators
in terms of recapitalization as governor warsh made reference to  there are very real challenges
but overall we have seen these cds spreads go up quite a bit  so i think that concern about the
negative dynamic scenario that people talked about is real and thats why it is very important to be
thinking about buying insurance
with respect to inflation certainly some of the numbers have been worrisome  it is clear
that inflation uncertainty is up  we can disagree as to exactly what that means either about
credibility or whether it is just uncertainty or whether its upside or downside scenarios but i think
it is up and that is something we should be concerned about  we should carefully craft our message
to take that into account because uncertainty can lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations and
that is something that we certainly dont want to see  i dont see evidence of unanchoring yet but i
do see a potential first step in that direction which does concern me  the simple fact that a memo
had to be written about what was going on with respect to some of these sharp movements suggests
that its not clear  although the memo was excellent i think there are elements in it that suggest we
dont fully understand and we need to be very careful about that  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i think were all trying to be cheery here  it
reminds me a little of one of my favorite scenes in a movie which is monty pythons life with
brian  i remember the scene with them there all on the cross and they start singing look on the
bright side of life  laughter  so let me talk a bit about my views on this  my personality does
do that but it is really that im strapped a bit to the cross  my view on the economy is that we are
going to have quite a weak first part of 2008 in which were going to skirt recession  this is my
modal forecast  i do think that the economy will be stronger in 2009 and 2010 but thats because i
decided to be even less of a piker than governor kohn  he accused president yellen but i was
going to accuse him because i did actually assume a 75 basis point cut at this meeting and then
another 50 basis point cut at the meeting following  then i hoped that afterward we would be able
to reverse  of course this is something to discuss tomorrow but it has to do with my views on how
you deal with financial disruptions and risk management  so ill talk about that tomorrow
even though i have a scenario that looks okay i do want to point out that four very
significant downside risks really worry me  we all talked about them  of course the first is
housing  but i worry about a particular dynamic which is that the negative price movements that
we currently see could be getting worse  people could be expecting that theyre getting worse and
therefore they want to hold off from buying a house because the effective cost of capital is higher
as somebody who stupidly is just going to contract on a new house because i have to please my
wife i actually thought exactly along these lines and was thinking about pulling out but then
decided that my marriage was more important
mr stern  it was close  laughter
mr mishkin  by the way if you know my wife no it wasnt close  the second issue is
that the potential for weaker house prices which really is a significant possibility not only could
lead to lower household wealth but more important also could reduce the value of collateral for
households and as a result mean that the relaxation of credit constraints that collateral affords is no
longer there  that could have major implications in terms of household spending so it is also a very
substantial downside risk to pce  the third issue is that we also see that the financial disruption has
already gotten worse  the good news is that there has been improvement on the liquidity front and
i give a lot of credit to the taf which was superbly thought out by our staff and has been quite
helpful  however credit conditions have worsened  particularly worrisomeand something that
hasnt been discussed muchis that the senior loan officer opinion survey had substantial
tightening  usually when you see this kind of tightening it could indicate that we could have
serious negative economic consequences  again that actually makes me very nervous  finally to
get even more depressed there really is potential for a negative feedback loop that has not yet set in
the financial disruption that were seeing right now could then mean a more substantial worsening
of the aggregate economy and that could make the financial markets have even more strain and
you have a problem  so i really worry about the downside risks and think that they are very
substantial and that we should be very concerned about them in thinking about what the appropriate
policy stance is
on the issue of inflation im more sanguine  i see inflation going down to 2 percent by
2009  the key here is that i think that inflation expectations are groundedin fact are grounded at
a level that is consistent with my inflation objective around 2 percent on pce which might be
different from others views but thats where i am right now  in that context given that inflation
expectations plus expectations about future slack in the economy are the primary drivers of inflation
dynamics i actually think that inflation will come down  it is true that the recent inflation numbers
have been very bad but in thinking about the overall risks im a bit different from the average
person on this committee because i think the risks are balanced and actually somewhat to the
downside  the reason i say this is that i think that inflation expectations are grounded  at the same
time there is a substantial downside risk in the economy that could really widen slack in the
economy and that would mean that inflation would come down
i dont want to be too sanguine on the issue of inflation expectations being grounded  in
fact one thing that i think we have to monitor very closely is whats happening in terms of inflation
expectations particularly financial markets views of inflation expectations  in a sense i think of
that as the canary in the coal mine  we are also going to want to look at expectations spreading to
professional forecasters and to households but i think information would come in first in terms of
the financial markets for the reason that they put their money on the table and react quickly  thats
one reason i think its very important to look at things like inflation compensation  but we do need
to look at this and do the analysis  my reading of the analysis that the staff gave and my thinking
about the issue is that there is just no evidence that inflation expectations have gone up  the story is
extremely hard to tell to go in that direction  however it is very easy to tell a story that inflation
uncertainty has gone up a lot and this is something that president evans talked about and we talked
about at the very beginning of a long day  in this context that does concern me and it really tells
me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflation expectations  so i think that
this is something that we have to be concerned about but i do not think that what has happened in
inflation compensation is that the canary is dropping dead at this stage  but we do have to monitor
this very very closely and again its part of the riskmanagement strategy that i think we have to
pursue  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you all for succinct and very insightful
comments  laughter  im going to try as usual to summarize what ive heard but even more so
than usual no warranty is expressed or implied  again trying to bring together some of the
comments we noted that incoming data since the last meeting have been broadly weaker than
expected and anecdotes generally suggest slower growth in some cases significantly slower
growth  housing demand construction and prices have continued to weaken and inventories of
unsold homes are little changed  housing weakness has implications for employment consumer
spending and credit conditions
with respect to households consumption growth has slowed reflecting falling house and
equity prices and other factors including generally greater pessimism about the labor market and
economic prospects  the labor market has softened by a range of measures with unemployment
jumping in december  however workers in some occupations remain in short supply  together
with financial indicators weaker labor and consumption data suggest that the economy is at a risk of
recession in any case it is likely to grow slowly for the first half of the year  the second half of the
year may be better the result of easier monetary policy fiscal stimulus and possible improvement
in housing and credit markets  however there are significant downside risks to growth including
the possibility of an adverse feedback loop between the economy and credit markets
reports by firms are mixed  investment may have slowed reflecting uncertainty and slower
growth in demand  commercial real estate activity may be constrained by tighter credit conditions
manufacturing is slow to mixed though it energy and some other sectors continue to be strong
financial markets remain stressed  credit conditions more generally appear to be worsening and
the problems may be spreading beyond housing  additional risks are posed by the problems of the
monoline insurers  credit losses have induced tighter lending standards and a key question is how
severe those may become and how persistent they may be  one offset is the ability of banks to raise
capital
core inflation and headline inflation have remained stubbornly high and are a concern  one
risk is the ability of some firms to pass through higher input costs  inflation compensation has risen
at long horizons reflecting some combination of higher inflation expectations and inflation risk
premiums  going forward a slowing economy anchored inflation expectations and possibly
stabilizing food and energy prices should lead to more moderate core and total inflation  however
some see upside risks especially the possibility that higher headline inflation might affect inflation
expectations  so thats my attempt to summarize  theres a great deal more detail and a great deal
more color in the conversations around the table
let me try to add a few points  again much of what ill say has been said  i do think that
there has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for economic growth and an increase in the
downside risks to growth  it was sufficiently severe as to prompt me to call the january 9
videoconference that we had and i think that since then we have had further deterioration  a
number of things have happened and are going on  very important perhaps most important is the
continued further deterioration in the prospects for the housing market  housing of course feeds
directly into the real economy through employment income and wealth and i think there are some
indications that spillover from the housing sector to the rest of the economy is increasing  however
the critical aspect of the housing outlook is the relationship to the financial system which ill come
back to
consumer spending has slowed  i think theres little doubt about that at this point  there
are a lot of factors now that are acting as headwinds in the consumer sector  let me just point out
the basic fact that most households in the united states have very little in the way of liquid financial
assets  therefore when they on the one hand are denied access to home equity if they see tighter
credit conditions on cards autos and so on and if at the same time they see greater uncertainty in
the economy and the labor market then their natural tendency would be to be much more
conservative in their spending  i do note that fiscal action may be of some help particularly for
people in that kind of situation  like president yellen i think the indicators of a weakening labor
market are broader than just the payroll report  there are a number of other things as well  we may
get a better report this week  the ui claims are a little encouraging but i do think that the
weakening economy is going to drag down the labor market to some extent  certainly the financial
markets have deteriorated reflecting greater concern about recession  we see it in the equity
markets but also in shortterm interest rates and a variety of credit measures as well  finally just
going through this list of items we continue to see problemscredit issues banks concerned about
additional losses not just in mortgages but perhaps in other areas as wellwith the potential
implication of a further tightening of credit conditions
those are some of the developments that weve seen since the last meeting  on our
january 9 call i talked about the regimeswitch model and those ways of thinking about the
business cycle  others have talked about that today  i think many of those models would suggest
that the probability of recession at this point is quite high at least 50 percent or more  i dont think
any of us would be happy to see a garden variety nber recession but if we had that there would
probably be a few benefits including correction of some imbalances that were seeing in the
economy and perhaps some reduction at the edge in the inflation picture  but like others i am most
concerned about what has been called the adverse feedback loopthe interaction between a
slowing economy and the credit markets  a phrase you might have heard which is getting great
currency among bankers is jingle mail  jingle mail is what happens when otherwise prime
borrowers decide that the value of their house is worth so much less than the principal of their
mortgage that they just mail their keys to the bank  i wonder if that 140 percent is the right loanto
value number  maybe its less than that  even if prime mortgages hold upand i think in some
regions of the country there will be significant problems with prime mortgagesthere is a lot of
other potential trouble  were just beginning to enter the period of maximum subprime arm
resets  second lien piggybacks and home equity loans are all questionable at this point  we havent
begun to address the option arm issue which is about the same size as the subprime arm
category and of course we have the issues with the monolines and private mortgage insurers
outside of mortgages expectations for credit performance are worsening in a range of areas
including commercial real estate and corporate credit  so i think that even under the relatively
benign scenario that the greenbook foresees were going to see a lot of pressure in the credit
markets and perhaps a long period of balance sheet repair tight credit and a drag on the economy
again our experience with financial drag or headwinds has been that it can be quite powerful and
deceptively so and i think thats a significant concern
now the central issue here though ultimately comes back to the housing market  certainly
by this point there must be some pentup demand for housing  weve had obviously very low sales
for a period  house prices are soft  mortgage rates are low  affordability is better  whats
keeping people from buying houses is the fact that other people arent buying houses  if there were
some sense that a bottom was forming in the market or in house prices we probably could actually
see a pretty quick snapback an increase in housing demand and that in turn would feed back into
the credit markets i think in a very beneficial way  so theres the possibility that if the housing
market can get restarted we could get a relatively benign outcome
mr mishkin  i hope so
chairman bernanke  however there appears to be a law of nature that the
turnaround in the housing market is always six months from the present date  we simply dont have
any evidence whatsoever that the housing market is bottoming out  we have guesses and estimates
about how far prices will fall and how far demand and construction will fall  the key issue is
prices and we are far from seeing the worst case scenario that you could imagine in prices  so long
as we dont see any stabilization in the housing market or stabilization in house prices then i dont
think we can say that the downside risks to the economy or to the credit system have been
contained  until that point i think we need to be very very alert to those risks
everyone has talked about inflation as should be the case  i am also concerned  the pickup
in core inflation is disappointing  there are some mitigating factors such as the role of nonmarket
prices which tend not to be serially correlated  we havent discussed owners equivalent rent in
this meeting for the first time in a while but we know that it can behave in rather odd ways during
periods of housing slowdowns  the hope is that energy and food prices will moderate in fact if oil
prices do rise by less than the twothirds increase of last year it would obviously be helpful
nominal wages dont seem to be reflecting high inflation expectations at this point  so i think there
are some reasons for optimism but as many people pointed out there are upward pressures
including the point that president fisher made that the lagged effects of the previous increases in
energy food and other commodity prices have probably not been fully realized in core inflation
furthermore as well talk about more tomorrow to the extent that we decide at this meeting to take
out some insurance against downside risks then implicit in that insurance premium might be a
greater risk of inflation six months or a year from now  so we have to take that into account as we
think about policy and about our communications as president plosser and others have pointed out
in particular as governor mishkin and others have noted we need to think about a policy strategy
that will involve not only providing adequate insurance against what i consider to be serious
downside risks but also a policy strategy that involves removing the accommodation in a timely
way when those risks have moderated sufficiently
so my reading of the situation is that its exceptionally fluid and that the financial risks in
particularas we saw for example after the october meetingcan be very hard to predict  there
are a lot of interactions between the financial markets and the real economy that are potentially
destabilizing and so we are going to have to be proactive in trying to stabilize the situation
recognizing that we have a confluence of circumstances that is extraordinarily difficult and that no
policy approach will deliver the optimal outcome in the short term  were just going to have to try
to choose a path that will give us the best that we can get given the circumstances that were facing
all right  any further comments or questions  we will reconvene tomorrow at nine
oclock  there is a reception and dinner optional available in the martin building  thank you
meeting recessed
january 30 2008morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  lets begin our meeting by
calling on dave stockton to report on the gdp data
mr stockton4  thank you mr chairman  my dictionary defines a miracle as an event so improbable that it appears to defy the laws of nature  along those lines we distributed a gdp report that compares our forecast with the actual number that was published this morning and they are exceedingly close  laughter  as you can see comparing the greenbook and advance estimate columns in fact it wasnt just close on the top line but it was really quite close in terms of the various components  personal consumption and business fixed investment were very close to our estimate  residential investment was not quite so weak in the advance release as it was in our forecast that might reflect either a different estimate by the bea about cost per start or something they know about additions and alterations that we dont
in the opposite direction federal spendingin particular defense spendingwas weaker in the advance estimate than we have incorporated in the greenbook estimate at the bottom of the table are the price indexes  both total pce and core pce were spoton with the forecast  really i didnt see anything in this report that would alter our outlook at all going forward  i would just note obviously that both the advance estimate and our greenbook estimate are based on partial data  there is still a lot left to be learned about the fourth quarter and even more about the first quarter going forward
one other piece of information that became available this morning was the adp report for private nonfarm payroll employment  that report showed an increase of 130000  looking at that report and thinking about our forecast of 20000 wed probably up our forecast to about 50000 for the month following our normal rules of thumb in responding to that  quite frankly i dont think that particular piece of information would alter my view about the state of the labor market going forward
as we noted yesterday we have seen a fair number of other indicators suggesting that there has been some softening in the labor markets  i think that is probably still the best bet going forward so i dont think at this point we would change too much our employment forecast
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any questions for dave  if not
brian would you like to talk now
mr madigan5  thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  your policy decision today takes place against an unusually complicated and uncertain backdrop over recent months reverberations from the contraction in the housing sector have

4  the materials used by mr stockton are appended to this transcript appendix 4
5  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 5
spread to the subprime mortgage market to financial markets and institutions more generally and now evidently to the broader economy  it seems clear based on the senior loan officer opinion survey and numerous other sources of information that these factors are interacting with mortgagerelated writedowns and concerns about the economic outlook triggering a broad and substantial tightening of credit to businesses and households and the tightening of credit feeding back onto the housing market and the economy  at the same time recent inflation performance has been disappointing the nearterm policy tradeoff appears to have deteriorated somewhat and inflation compensation has risen  meanwhile investors have been rather skittish and in the environment of heightened uncertainty have sought more clarity in your communications and more assurance about policy prospects than you can reasonably provide  the combination of all these factors has left financial market prices unusually volatile  in these circumstances the committee faces a difficult task in reaching judgments as to the outlook and the balance of risks gauging the appropriate policy course and communicating your views to the public
to provide some assistance in your policy deliberations today a box in the bluebook explored the possible implications of addressing pronounced downside risks to growth through monetary policy and the charts from that box are replicated in exhibit 1  the panels in the lefthand column consider the possible benefits of risk management under the assumption that a recession does develop  the recession considered in this exercise is the same as that examined in an alternative scenario in part 1 of the greenbook  as you may recall that scenario was calibrated to match the typical degree of weakness relative to fundamentals in expenditures other than those for housing in six past recessions  the dotted line shows the results as gauged using the frbus model if the committee were to respond to emerging evidence of an unfolding recession by adjusting policy in a manner similar to its past behavior as captured by the staffs estimated outcomebased policy rule  in this case the committee lowers the federal funds rate gradually to about  percent by mid2009
the unemployment rate peaks at about 61 percent and inflation eventually falls below 1 percent  the blue line shows the results that would be predicted if instead the committee responded more aggressively  here we have arbitrarily assumed that the committee lowers the federal funds rate to 1 percent this quarter and holds the rate at that level through the second quarter  from that point forward it follows the outcomebased rule  if the recessionary conditions do eventuate the timely policy stimulus moderates the downturn in activity trimming about  percentage point off the peak unemployment rate and helps keep inflation from falling toward a region that some of you might find uncomfortably low
although aggressive policy easing would help mitigate economic weakness it would also raise the risk that policy could add unduly to inflation pressures should recessionary weakness not develop a possibility explored in the righthand column the simulations underlying this column are carried out under the baseline greenbook scenario  as shown by the blue line the cost of an aggressive nearterm easing in the absence of a recession could be limited if policymakers were to recognize quickly that the economy was not weakening to the degree feared and boosted the federal
funds rate rapidly  in this simulation the committee increases the funds rate about 2 percentage points in six monthsthat is at a pace of more than 50 basis points per meetingto around 4 percent  this prompt reversal brings the funds rate
1 percentage point above the baseline providing an offset to the earlier period of excessively easy policy  in this case core inflation would run slightly higher than baseline for a couple of quartersas shown in the bottom righthand panel by the distance between the solid blue line and the dotted black linebut would subsequently return to baseline  in contrast as shown in the dashed red line if policymakers were slow to recognize that no recession was in train and so reversed policy more gradually after the first two quartersthat is in line with your historical behaviorconsiderable momentum could be imparted to economic activity with the unemployment rate the middle panel running roughly  percentage point below baseline into 2011  the cost of responding more aggressively to the risk of a recession in this case could be inflation that remains 01 or 02 percentage point above the baseline path for several years the bottom righthand panel  concern about such an outcome could give you some pause as you consider how much insurance you wish to seek at this and coming meetings
your concerns in this regard may also be exacerbated by the fact that the inflation picture seems to have deteriorated somewhat in recent months  your current projections reflect some worsening of the inflationoutput tradeoff with more slack apparently required over the next three years to push inflation down toward what would appear to be your preferred outcomes  also as was discussed yesterday five yearforward inflation compensation increased notably over the intermeeting period while there are reasons to question whether much of that rise represents an increase in inflation expectations it might be due in part to a higher inflation risk premium perhaps signaling that inflation expectations are becoming more loosely moored and are hence more prone to drift in response to various shocks
if you were particularly concerned about a possible unmooring of inflation expectations you might be inclined toward alternative d shown in the righthand column of table 1 which is included as the next page  under this alternative you would hold the stance of monetary policy steady at this meeting but would indicate that the risks to growth remain tilted to the downside  however based on the interest rate assumptions provided with your forecast submissions the recommendations of most reserve banks to reduce the discount rate by 50 basis points and your comments yesterday it appears that most if not all of you see some easing today as appropriate  consequently i will dispense with a detailed discussion of alternative d rather the questions for todays meeting would seem to be not whether to reduce rates but how much and what to say about the outlook for growth inflation and policy
under alternative c the committee would reduce rates 25 basis points today
the rationale section of the statement would note that financial markets remain under stress cite the tightening of credit availability and mention the deepening of the housing contraction and the softening of labor markets  with regard to inflation the
committee would note its expectation that inflation should moderate but it would also cite a range of factors that could put upward pressure on inflation  the statement would conclude by indicating that the policy action combined with actions taken earlier should help promote moderate growth over time but it would also warn that downside risks to growth remain  the committee might see alternative c as appropriate if it believes that some further easing of policy is warranted by the deterioration in the economic outlook and the associated risks but feels that a moderate move is preferable today given the policy steps you have taken to date the possibility that the fiscal stimulus could still turn out to be larger than currently envisaged and questions about how firmly inflation expectations are anchored
market participants currently put considerably greater odds on a 50 basis point move today than on a 25 basis point action  moreover market participants reportedly expect you to issue a statement similar to the january 22 announcement but the addition of the sentence on inflation risks in the third paragraph would likely suggest to investors that you have significant concerns about inflation  the combination of a smallerthanexpected policy move and the statement drafted for alternative c would likely suggest to investors that monetary policy had shifted into an incremental mode shorterterm interest rates would likely rise somewhat and equity prices could decline noticeably
should the committee see an outcome along the lines of the greenbook forecast as most likely it might be attracted to the 50 basis point easing of alternative b under alternative b the committee would issue an announcement that closely resembles the january 22 statement  however the fourth paragraph would include a sentence indicating that the policy actions to date should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate downside risks to growth  in the second sentence of that paragraph the word appreciable used in the january 22 statement would be dropped from the characterization of the risks presumably in recognition of the significant further adjustment of policy under this alternative  as discussed yesterday the greenbookconsistent measure of r has declined more than
1 percentage points since the december meeting to about  percentage point  a 50 basis point move today would leave the real federal funds rate just below
1 percent gauged on the same basis as our r measure  thus by the r metric policy would remain slightly restrictive under alternative b consistent with applying modest downward pressure to inflation going forward  policymakers might view such a policy stance as appropriate if they saw the downside risks to growth as roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation following such a policy action  however given the views expressed in your economic projectionsin particular the assessment expressed by many that the trajectory for the funds rate would probably need to be a little lower in the near term than assumed in the greenbookit seems more likely that you would prefer the approach of alternative b if you believed that further easing will likely be warranted but should be implemented somewhat gradually perhaps to provide time to assess the effects of the policy easing already put in place  with investors placing greatest weight on a policy choice at this meeting along the lines of alternative b this approach would likely prompt relatively little
reaction in financial markets this afternoon  given recent developments the committee may place a larger premium than usual on avoiding policy surprises
if you have lowered your economic outlook even more sharply than the staff or if you see the downside risks as particularly large you might not see moderation as a virtue and prefer to ease policy aggressively by 75 basis points at this meeting as in alternative a  this approach would seem consistent with the concerns and policy assumptions expressed by many of you in your forecast narratives  indeed some of you have espoused a riskmanagement approach to policy in which the federal funds rate is lowered sharply in the near term to provide greater assurance of continued economic expansion and then that policy easing is reversed quickly once it becomes clear that risks are diminishing  as suggested by the riskmanagement simulations that i discussed earlier this approach relies heavily on your ability to recognize promptly that the stimulus is not needed and to reverse field rapidly  binary options on target fed funds futures suggest that over the past few days market participants have essentially priced out the possibility that you will take such aggressive action today  thus money market rates would likely decline sharply in response to implementation of this alternative downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase and equity prices could rise somewhat although any rally could be damped by a sense among investors that you were motivated to take this action by concerns about pronounced economic weakness  obviously a significant concern with a step of this magnitude today would be the possible implications for inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty  although the relative contributions of various factors to the recent increase in inflation compensation can be debated last weeks policy move seemed to be well understood at the time as a response to incoming evidence of a sharply deteriorating economic outlook  by contrast the motivations for a largerthanexpected move today might be less clear to market participants potentially elevating the risk of loosening the inflation expectations anchor  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for brian  governor
mishkin
mr mishkin  i would like to ask a question and possibly make a comment about the
riskmanagement strategies  am i correct in understanding that the treatment of expectations is
basically backwardlooking
mr madigan  that is correct governor mishkin
mr mishkin  so even though you know i am a fan ofwell lets put it this way you
said moderation and i am not a fan of moderation in many dimensions  but there is a potential
cost here that is not articulated which is that if there is a very aggressive easing and it has an
effect on inflation expectations then the more benign scenario that we have in terms of cost may
not be there  this is one of the reasons that if we think about a riskmanagement approach we
have to think about whether we can do it more systematically  what kind of communications
would be attached to it  also what kind of information would we have to watch out for to make
sure that we dont unhinge inflation expectations  so although i think this is a terrific box and it
was very very useful there is a bit of a qualm here  it is also very hard to model the issue of
what would happen to expectations  so i am not complaining in any way about the usefulness of
this but we should have another concern which is how we would manage inflation expectations
if we pursued an approach like this  thank you
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  my question is related to what governor
mishkin just asked about  the riskmanagement analysis was very helpful it was a very good
addition and it captures a number of things that we have talked about  one is sort of a quick
policy reversal or the potential for that if things go well  my question is how do you see the
path of communications likely to evolve  what is it going to look like  what will it sound like
if we are thinking about reversing policy and we get to the bottom and then we start taking it
back a little more quickly than normal  a lot of times when we have done this before you heard
the phrase that markets need to be prepared for this and they have to understand it  would that
somehow get in the way of the stimulus  i think this gets a bit at what governor mishkin was
talking about in terms of expectations  in particular do you have any thoughts about how the
slope of the yield curve might help inform how people are going to be thinking about this  are
we going to move from something that is potentially inverted or flat to a rising yield curve that
could inform a better outlook and then raising rates could maybe in a parallel fashion move the
yield curve up  i am just curious whether that could be helpful for the communications strategy
mr madigan  i think my response is that it is very difficult to say how your
communications should or will evolve going forward at this point because of the very substantial
uncertainty in the economic outlook which shows up very clearly in the committee participants
economic forecasts  presumably what you say will depend on evolving circumstances  in terms
of the yield curve again i think that is difficult  that will depend on the interaction of market
participants perception of incoming economic information with their sense of your own policy
reactions
mr evans  im just curious if in the path of this simulation the yield curve behaves
in that fashion or not  this gets at what the mechanism is for the stimulus  is it to improve
market liquidity market functioning long rates or an expectation of short rates  if they start
expecting a tightening is that going to get in the way of something and so we are going to view
that as more difficult to move at that time  i think everybody is quite committed to the idea that
we need to do the right type of policy reversal when it is called for but it is going to be very
difficult to identify in the moment  so the yield curve could help
mr madigan  in these simulations the standard channels of monetary policy are
working through things like the yield curve asset prices the foreign exchange value of the
dollar household wealth et cetera
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  brian i want to compliment you and the
staff for presenting these riskmanagement strategies  i think it is really useful for the
committee to see and think about these in terms of strategies rather than sort of oneoff policy
choices and thinking through a sequence of actions like this is very very helpful  governor
mishkin asked about expectations and noted that they were backwardlooking and i wanted to
ask about that  you guys have described to us before that there are firms and wage setters and
then there are financial markets  is there a forwardlooking part in the financial markets or is
that backwardlooking as well
mr madigan  the financial markets are forwardlooking in these simulations
mr lacker  as you know in applied macroeconomics there is a range of
approaches to handling expectations and the rest of the range is filled out with more forward
looking approaches  in this instancein the instance of a recessionyou hear and read a lot
about recession  in fact there was a story in the paper today about businesses preparing for a
recession  so you get the sense that market participants might be understanding that this is a
special episode of economic dynamics called a recession and look back to past recessions and
think of it in sort of a forwardlooking way  that to me more than in the usual circumstances
heightens the value of thinking through or at least exploring the implications of a forward
looking approach to expectations  i say that in particular thinking about these strategies because
we get only a few trials on recessions  they are pretty rare and so the inferences a set of market
participants are going to make about recessions is going to be influenced by their past recessions
this is going to be the last chance to influence their perceptions about how we behave in the next
recession  so i am really interested in thinking through our strategy for this recession from the
point of view of well what if from now on market participants expect us to adopt the strategy
that we do adopt in this  that is why i would like to see some analysis that says well all right
if this is the strategy and it is understood by agents that this is our strategy how does the
economy behave  so we adopt a strategy and it is one that we think we can sustain and one
that we would like to choose again in the future if it is understood
related to that governor mishkin mentioned inflation and inflation expectations and i
was a little confused about the discussion yesterday because i always thought of us as wanting to
minimize the distortion in the rate of return on money and that suggests minimizing the raw
return gap between nominal and real securities  so i am not quite sure that we dont care nearly
as much about the variance in inflation or the risk premiums due to inflation as we do about
expected inflation  is that your understanding when you guys think through optimal monetary
policy  i know you do scenarios like that  i mean how do the fluctuations and the variance in
inflation fit in
mr madigan  i dont think they fit in in a direct way  we still have a lot of work
ahead of us despite the progress that we have made in modeling in recent years to consider
things like the distribution of different economic outcomes and how skewness in those
distributions both with respect to output and with respect to inflation would interact with risk
aversion in monetary policymaking  i dont think our science has quite gotten to that stage yet
but i agree that these are worthwhile things to study further
mr lacker  one thought i had in that discussion about expected inflation you noted
that the onetofiveyear rise in inflation hadnt been affected much but the fivetotenyear rise
had  if it is well understood by agents when going through something like a recession which
comes around only every once in a while maybe it is ratifying current inflation and not bringing
it down  you might expect that the inference would change about how inflation behaves in the
next recession which would come five to ten years from now  wouldnt it
mr madigan  i see the point you are making and that sounds plausible  you know
again our thought was that if investors were concerned that monetary policy makers were
making an inflationary mistake it would begin to affect inflation in the near term meaning
within several years rather than seven or eight years ahead
chairman bernanke  i have just a technical question on inflation expectations
you presented to us at some point a variation of the model in which the policy action itself was
fed into the model for inflation expectations  is that part of the model at this point
mr stockton  no  it is not part of the baseline model that we are running off of
mr reifschneider  that is operating here very much  it is the same mechanism
but it works differently in the two cases because in the case where the recession actually shows
up whether you take the gradualist approach or you take the riskmanagement approach they
see the recession and the easing in monetary policy doesnt surprise them very much although
we can take our riskmanagement approach and respond a bit more than usual  but then things
behave as they expect and so not too much happens to inflation expectations  in the other case
in which recession doesnt emerge they say oh this was an easing that wasnt expected and
then it becomes critical how long you hold it  if you hold it and you get rid of it only gradually
then inflation expectations start to shift up  they think the feds inflation goal has changed  in
the case where you take it away quickly they say okay you took it away quickly and so not
much happens to longrun inflation expectations
chairman bernanke  so the answer is that the funds rate is affecting inflation
expectations in these simulations
mr reifschneider  in both cases  but the question is whether it is viewed in the
context of what is happening to output and inflation whether they say yes that fits with the
historical pattern of stabilization or whether because the recession didnt emerge this looks as
though it was after the fact an ease in policy that was not warranted  then the question is do
you take it away quickly or do you take it away slowly
mr lacker  okay  so in the case where we are doing the riskmanagement
approach do they understand that we are more likely to reverse course or do they just mark
down their whole expected path for policy
mr reifschneider  no they dont know that you are more likely to reverse course
in that case  so when you think of a communication strategy which is not in these simulations
it says oh were going to do this but in the event that the recession doesnt occur we will take
it away more quickly than we might have based on historical averages  but it doesnt make too
much difference in the simulation because it is taken quickly  just because the funds rate is
down surprisingly low for a quarter or two that is not long enough to have much of an effect on
longrun inflation expectations in that simulation  what it would do in the real world is different
mr lacker  we are trying to model the real world
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  there is a castle in the sand quality in this
discussion  let me make just three points on what i took from this and see if i got it right  one
is in the staffs judgment at 3 percentin that view of the world which is not way off from
where the discussion was yesterdaypolicy is not providing any degree of insurance or
accommodation against the adverse outcomes that may be ahead
the second thing i took away is that this framework seems like a good way of thinking
about how you think about moving lower how you think about what mistake were going to
make or we want to make  we are going to make a mistake but it is good to think about what
mistake is more costly and what mistake is easier to correct  it seems to me it tells us almost
nothing frankly about when we are going to be in a position where we are going to want to start
to take it back  it also probably tells us very little about how quickly we are going to want to
take it back  i would have thought that the most remarkable thing in these paths is how little
difference the variance is in the outcomes a year out  i mean they must be so far within the
range of uncertainty in this context and for us to start thinking now about how to design the
optimal exit and communicate it not just for president evanss reasons but many others just
basic humility it seems to me kind of premature  i have a lot of sympathy for the fact that we
will want to make sure that we are choosing which error we are going to make  i have a lot of
sympathy for thinking through how we correct for that error  but for us to assert because we are
worried about the implications of that that we are going to start focusing now on the design of
the exit sounds to me a bit like a statement of the obvious  of course we are going to move with
alacrity to take back and make sure those inflation expectations stay anchored at a reasonable
level  of course we are  to suggest otherwise and to assert it would look kind of insecurea
lack of confidence in what we are here to do
the third thing i took away from it is that it seems to say that if you make policy in a
way consistent with the response of this committee over the past decade and a half or so you
have pretty good outcomes in the strategy in which you take out enough risk against the
downside error  now life could be uncertain  maybe that is too charitable to the past but it
seems to be kind of reassuring in that way
chairman bernanke  i think that it is hard to generalize  you say there are so
few recessions so the specific communication that is undertakenfor example in the last
episode there was actually communication that leaned against the rapid reversalyou know
considerable period and so on  so rather than trying to generalize from two examples i think
it would much more have to do with how we present the outlook and communicate our
intentions  other questions for brian  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  yes  i just want to make a comment about what president geithner said
and follow up on president evanss question  one thing that the simulation doesnt get at is the
adverse feedback loop  its just not built into the model  so the benefits of pursuing a risk
management approach are not as clear as they would be if they were included in the simulation
however i would like to focus on president evanss issue because i think it really is critical  he
asked about how we might know whether or not we should reverse and talked about things like
the yield curve  but one thing that is important to recognize in this scenario is that i think it is
very unusual in terms of this committees past behavior  but i dont know  don you are my
man who is the ancient mariner here  have we ever reversed this quickly in past episodes
mr kohn  by this quickly what do you mean
mr mishkin  what the path of the prompt reversal is
mr kohn  i think it depends  as the chairman was saying there hasnt really been a
typical recession  right  we have had two recessions in the past twenty years and i think in
both cases we stayed down longer because of the circumstances  so in 199293 we had a zero
real funds rate while the economy was growing for two years  then when we started raising we
did raise very quickly  so i think that was mixed  i can remember presenting to the board as a
staff member charts in 1990 showing how interest rates always reversed with the trough of the
recession a couple of months this way a couple of months that way  and that was just wrong  i
mean it was just a different circumstance because of the 50 mile an hour headwinds  so it is
going to be very hard to set expectations about what we are going to do that will influence people
in the future because each episode is so different  as the chairman was saying we were very
worried in 200304 that people would generalize from 1994 and see us reversing rather quickly
so we got into this verbal gymnastics to try to modify their expectations because we thought the
rapid reversal in that case would not be consistent with macroeconomic stability  this is a case
in which we are just going to have to judge when we get to the circumstances what is necessary
without knowing ahead of time what the pattern is going to be
mr mishkin  so let me turn back to president evanss question because there is an
issue about what kind of information might tell us that we took out insurance and then it wasnt
needed  i think some pieces of information that the staff has been looking at are relevant
particularly important in this regard is that there are a lot of indicators of financial stress  what
is different about this episode is that the reason we are so worried about downside risk is the
financial strains and there are a lot of pieces of information that the staff has been producing that
could be very important in terms of looking at this  they have a financiali dont know what
you call your indicator but you have something that you have been using in your model dave
that takes up spreads and volatility and
mr stockton  principal components
mr mishkin  principal components of these things
mr stockton  there are a lot of financial variables
mr mishkin  also an issue that the chairman raised yesterday was that the housing
market is a big component of our downside risk  the markets concerns about future declines in
housing prices are causing a very sharp decrease in demand for housing  that could turn around
very quickly as well  even now we should be thinking about these issues and governor kohns
use of the word nimblei like flexibility but i think nimble is probably a better wordis
really i think key here  it is somewhat of a departure from normalexactly what the chairman
said  this episode is different from past episodes  so we do need to start thinking about this
and the staff will need to think about exactly these issues
chairman bernanke  president poole you had an interjection
mr poole  yes  i am older than governor kohn so i can answer  laughter
mr mishkin  it is not age  it is how long you have been in the system
mr poole  1958 was just about like that
mr lacker  like what
mr poole  like that prompt reversal
mr lacker  oh interesting
mr poole  it was very much a sharp v
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  i just wanted to point out that the reason i asked the question about how
you think about the exit strategy is that since we are putting a lot of discussion weight on the
reversal it is going to color how you think about the next move potentially if not today then
another day  so i think it brings the future into the present very quickly
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  if i could just continue the dialogue with governor kohn  it has been
observed by some that the past two recessions differ from previous postwar recessions in some
key dimensions and some have drawn the conclusion that it is the changing nature of the
business cycle after the great moderation  both have been characterized as shallow and longer
lasting  i take the point that ones inferences about a third instance are going to be very tenuous
naturally  but it is also natural to look back to those episodes and see what we can draw out of
them  you mentioned headwinds in 1990 and we had some special stuff that kept us from
raising rates with nimbleness in 2003 and 2004  to what extent do you think that is likely
coming out of this episode that the types of things that kept us from raising rates in the 1990s
and in both of these episodes are likely to recur
vice chairman geithner  may i answer that
mr lacker  well i asked governor kohn but if he gets to respond
vice chairman geithner  i will follow don
mr kohn  i think we are really getting into the policy discussion right now and the
issue really will be the headwinds the financial market restraint  so it is reasonable to think
that we are facing at least 25 mile an hour headwinds  i also think that it is going to take a while
for the headwinds to abate  it is going to take a while to rechannel these credit flows to restart
many of the secondary markets in mortgages  so my personal view is that i wouldnt be
surprised to see us having to run with a real federal funds rate that is below the historical average
for some time  but as everyone has been saying it is highly uncertain and very dependent on
how the financial markets evolve and how the real economy responds to those markets
mr lacker  for followup before president geithner responds to the extent that we
place greater likelihood on that should these simulations suggest that we should take that into
account in how rapidly we cut now
chairman bernanke  i dont think so  i would just point out that with the
199091 episode inflation after the recessionafter the whole episode was overwas
significantly lower than in the period before it  so if there are headwinds that are bringing the
economy below potential and are causing high unemployment for example there has to be a
mechanism  expectations have to be tied to something and there has to be some way in which
excessively low interest rates are stimulating inflation through either commodity prices or wage
pressures or some other mechanism  if those pressures arent there because of headwinds or
some other factor then unusually low interest rates will not by themselves create inflation  vice
chairman did you have anything else you wanted to add
vice chairman geithner  i really couldnt tell president lacker what inference
you were going to draw from that  but i would just reinforce the point that if you are more
worried and uncertain now about the magnitude of the headwinds and the duration i think it has
to mean that you err on the side of going lower sooner  but the main point is that we just dont
know much about it and i think it is worth a lot of humility  i mean think how surprised we
have been by so much over this period even with all our thinking through three years ago about
alternative paths for housing  so i would just vote for humility  but the basic point is that we
have to err on the side of being worried about reducing the risk that you end up with 75 mile an
hour headwinds rather than 25 for a long period of time
chairman bernanke  could we start our policy round  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  like the greenbook my projection for the
real economy incorporates a sharp decline in the equilibrium real fed funds rate  given the large
risks facing the real economy i think we need to take precautions against having a restrictive fed
funds rate target  i think a 50 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate today may be large
enough to eliminate that possibility although there is plenty of uncertainty around that estimate
as we have been discussing  based on my analysis comments from my business contacts and
what i have heard from all of you at this meeting i feel very comfortable supporting this position
today  the economic environment has been volatile and highly uncertain and i realize that my
outlook could change appreciably in the weeks and months ahead  i can imagine that my
economic projections will evolve in a way that supports even further reductions in the fed funds
rate target
at the same time as i said yesterday i am concerned about inflation risks and that they
may now be elevated  i can also imagine scenarios that would lead me to want to pursue a more
restrictive policy than would be appropriate based on the downside risk to growth alone  at
some point on the margin inflation concerns could become my dominant concern  we know
that inflation expectations play a crucial role in determining the inflation outlook  we have been
talking about that  but unfortunately we dont really know all that much about what it is going
to take to unanchor inflation expectations  it is hard to know for certain how far out on the ice
we can skate without needing to worry that the ice has become too thin  i know that we are
bringing our best thinking to bear on this issue by developing diagnostic tools such as the
decomposition of inflation compensation into its component parts as we talked about yesterday
and this morning  i hope that we are going to come to learn that these tools are useful guides to
policy but we just dont have enough experience with them to know how much confidence to
place in their estimates
yesterday governor kohn told us about his conversation with paul volcker and that paul
volcker told him that unfortunately we do have experience of seeing the erosion of public
confidence in our ability to meet our price stability objective and we know from this experience
that it makes the attainment of price stability more costly  but today i support the policy
directive expressed in alternative b  my concerns today are more with the downside risk to
economic growth  given what i know today i think it is the right course of action  i have
discovered during the past couple of weeks that i can be very nimble when it comes to the
reduction in our fed funds rate target  if inflation developments require i want to be just as
nimble in the other direction  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  given the discussion i have heard so far it is
apparent to me that we will most likely move to a 3 percent fed funds rate today  if we do so i
think we should be prepared to stop at this point and let the market work through the
disturbances that only time and market adjustments will correct  while i would not precommit
to no further cuts i would give no hint of them either  i think that is important  the discussion
we just had around this table is that we cannot know the future there are always headwinds and
we will make a mistake  therefore we should limit ourselves to some extent  as i have
expressed in this committee before i think we should narrow the range to which we are willing
to move the fed funds rate  my judgment is that to move to levels outside the reasonable range
that yes i know would be debated but a reasonable range of neutral is as likely to introduce
disturbances into the economy as it is to moderate the economys performance
i find an approach to policy that focuses on the real equilibrium rate compelling  i think
it is good theory and it is common sense and can be explained to the public  i understand that
we cannot observe the equilibrium rate but we cannot observe the nairu potential gdp or
most other criteria  the real rate is at least related to the policy tool that we focus on which is
interest rates  when you systematically move below or above the neutral rate you
systematically stimulate or restrict the economy  with that in mind and since monetary policy
works with a lag i would recommend that we follow a policy in which we stop moving rates and
let the market work once we are notably below or above the longrun neutral rate based upon a
reasonable estimate  this is a credible approach to policy  today a nominal 3 percent fed funds
rate would provide for an actual inflationadjusted rate that is less than 1 percent  that is quite
stimulative  that will serve to support the real economy as the financial sector adjusts and it has
to adjust  to stimulate the economy further at our current inflation rate is to invite or at least to
increase the probability of higher inflation or encourage the next asset bubble or both and it will
undermine our credibility in the long run
turning to the press statement i have three brief comments  first in paragraph 2 i
would begin by putting the economic rationale before the financial market reference which
would most appropriately align our recent actions with our concern for the downside risk to the
economy and place our concern for financial market stress in better perspective  second i
believe that a detailed discussion of inflation risk may not be helpful at this time and the less
said the better  therefore i prefer the language in paragraph 3 of alternative b rather than any
other of the options  finally i believe we should modify the risk assessment to provide more
flexibility for future decisions  most important it should place less emphasis on the possibility
of future rate cuts and better position us to return to a neutral position later this year and early
next  therefore i would rewrite paragraph 4 along the lines that president plosser suggested
to summarize i suggest that we act at this meeting explain our action as i suggested and hold
at that point  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b though i think a
case can be made for alternative a  the boston model indicates that even after a 50 basis point
reduction we still need more easing to return to an economy with both full employment and
inflation below 2 percent  taking out insurance against moresevere downside risks would
imply even more easing than our baseline forecast  given our recent move and the additional
easing in alternative b i am comfortable waiting to take more aggressive action only if incoming
data warrant it  however i will not be surprised if we find further action is indeed needed
what would be the arguments against taking an aggressive tack  certainly one
argument might be that elevated oil and commodity prices and core inflation currently above
2 percent warrant a more restrained approach  however i would note that in previous recessions
the inflation rate has declined significantly even in the 1970s in the midst of historic surges in
energy and food prices  whether we skirt a recession or experience a recession i expect core
inflation to trend down  a potential second argument is that we have responded too slowly to the
need for tighter policy in the past so we should be more reluctant to ease in the present  while it
may be true that we raised rates too slowly at the onset of previous expansions i see no reason
for this committee to behave in a manner that it believes is suboptimal  as a committee we
seem to have consensus on the importance of maintaining low inflation rates and i am confident
we have the will to raise rates with the same alacrity that we reduced them should economic
conditions warrant such action
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  since september this committee has
lowered the federal funds rate 175 basis points  my estimate is that the real funds rate before any
action today is 1 percent or slightly below that and that is very low by historical standards  the
slowdown in growth suggests that the equilibrium real rate really has fallen and the committee
has appropriately allowed the nominal funds rate to fall as well  do nominal rates need to go
lower and if so about how much  part of this depends on what you think the equilibrium real
rate of the economy is now  the bluebook indicates that estimates of r vary considerably by
the model and the process they use to calculate them  the 70 percent confidence interval around
them is 3 percentage points  moreover the estimates of r as we talked a bit about yesterday
can be quite volatile  it troubles me that the estimate of r consistent with the greenbook has
changed by 140 basis points from december to today  i am uncomfortable using an estimate that
is so variable and so sensitive to stock markets as a guide to setting policy  i also want to note
that the bluebook indicates that the appropriate funds rate based on a range of taylor rule
specifications is anywhere from 40 to 120 basis points above where we currently are today
that includes forecastbased versions of the rule that rely on the weak forecast found in the
greenbook
while i dont want to suggest that such guidelines are definitive they do suggest that the
current level of the fed funds rate is clearly accommodative and that we have taken out insurance
against downside risk  when do we stop taking out more insurance  if we do cut 50 basis points
today which is the amount the market is expecting it would bring to my mind the real funds
rate down to below  percent  that is based on expectations of about 2 percent inflation
which in fact may be conservative  to my way of thinking that is a very accommodative policy
by any standard  moreover i dont believe that enough time has elapsed for us to realize the full
effect of the cuts that we have already put in place  i share president hoenigs concern that only
the market can solve many of the problems that we see out there and we must give the market
time and patience to do so  the last time real rates were this low was in 200304 when the real
rate was in fact apparently negative  but that was different  inflation was running around
1 percent or less and our concern was possible deflation  today we are not worried about
deflation in the near term  we are worried about inflation inflation has been moving up
lowering rates too aggressively in todays situation would seem to me a risky strategy fueling
inflation possibly setting up the next boombust cycle which i worry about and delaying the
recognition of losses on banks balance sheets but not eliminating them  the main effect of the
rate cut will be after the first half of the year if the economy begins to recover  i think we need
to be very cautious not to get carried away in our insurance strategies with lowering rates too
much  in my view we are on the verge of overshooting and i worry about the broad range of
consequences for our credibility and the expectations of our future actions such behavior may
have  that is closely related to president lackers comments about what people interpret that
behavior to mean about what we may do in future episodes  but two things are even more
important in my mind about what we may do and what we do today
first we need to be very careful about our communications and not to excessively
reinforce the markets expectation that further rate cuts are coming  in particular i would feel
much more comfortable with supporting a moderate 25 or 50 basis point cut if the statement
language today were more agnostic about the balance of risks as i suggested in my memo before
the meeting  the market interprets our saying that there are downside risks to growth as that we
are planning to cut rates again  i do not think we should encourage those beliefs  i worry that
the balance of risks portion of our statements has come to be a code for predicting the path of our
federal funds rate  i think that is not a good position for us to be in nor should we condone it
given the greenbook forecast i dont believe that negative real rates are called for and
signaling further cuts clearly sends the message that negative real rates are on the way if not
already here  when our forecasts are released the public will get our assessments of the risks in
our outlook  we dont need to say anything more about it in the statement  that of course does
not preclude us from cutting rates again if our forecast deteriorates further  but until it does i
am reluctant to encourage the perception that more rate cuts are forthcoming
second as i said in the last goround we need to be able to better understand how we are
going to unwind these cuts that we have implemented as insurance against the macroeconomic
effects and financial disruptions  of course this was the theme of the discussion we had before
the goround  unwinding those cuts too slowly not only risks our credibility on inflation but also
risks setting up the next boombust cycle  hindsight of course is always 2020 but as we
discussed in mondays videoconference the feds being slow to raise rates back up after the
deflationary scare was over in 2003 may indeed have contributed to the conditions we are facing
today  thus it is crucially important to my mind that we do have a plan for unwinding the
significant cuts we have implemented as insurance against the financial turmoil  if the market
turmoil subsides i believe this committee needs to have clear signals as to what we are going to
look at and what has to happen before we start to remove the accommodation  i believe that the
committee must undo the accommodation as aggressively as we put it in play  we need to
determine what indicators we will be looking at to determine when that process should begin
when we know ourselves we want to help the markets and public understand what our process
will be as well  i strongly believe that we must be both credible and committed policymakers
and our communications must signal not a particular funds rate path but articulate and focus on
the contingent nature of that path and help the public understand and appreciate the systematic
part of our policies and our policy decisions  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i think the best course of action today is to
lower the fed funds rate by 50 basis points as in alternative b  ive heard cogent arguments that
50 basis points would be restrictive and likewise accommodative  yesterday i had a chance to look
at the disabilitiesrelated display in the elevator lobby on the concourse level and i took some
comfort in the fact that many great people are or were bipolar  so whether its restrictive or
accommodative i can be convinced either way  i can live with the idea that this does not
incorporate a great deal of insurance against the downside provided that the language doesnt
preclude further timely action as we have been using the word timely  so regarding paragraph 4
my preference is for language that first serves to signal that the committee is fully aware of the
situation and not behind the curve a signal thats reassuring and confidence enhancing and second
preserves our nimbleness our flexibility meaning that it doesnt preclude any options to respond to
developments including further moves and intermeeting actions  i think the straightforward
phraseology downside risks to growth remain as opposed to what was suggested in alternative a
which included may well is preferable because the alternative a language strikes me as a bit too
clever and risks appearing out of touch  i also think that repetition of the in a timely manner
language from the january 22 statement preserves the options to move in an intermeeting action if
necessary  so i think alternative b language is acceptable because it is spare straightforward and
familiar and its the least likely to confuse the markets in the near term  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like president lockhart i agree with the action
and the language of alternative b  as i noted a few minutes ago i dont think a real interest rate of
around 1 percent which is where we would be after this action is really all that aggressively low
given what were facing in financial markets and the uncertainty thats constraining business and
household behavior in terms of spending  i guess i wouldnt obsess so mucha loaded word
thereabout where we are exactly relative to some estimate of the neutral federal funds rate  as
president plosser pointed out our band of confidence around that is huge  it moves around a lot
when its defined in the shortterm threeyear window that the staff has been using but i think we
just need to concentrate on the forecast where we think this path of rates would have us go
the forecast central tendencies that we looked at yesterday look like a pretty good set of
tradeoffs between getting back to full employment and damping inflation  i think one message from
this longerterm forecast exercise is where the committee thinks the taylor curve is and where we
would like to end up on it in terms of trading off inflation and output variability  if i heard brian
correctly these results encompass not only a fairly universal assumption of 50 basis points at this
meeting but at least ten of the cases see further rate cuts after that  in my case i assumed further
rate cuts but that they would start to be taken back in 2009  so it seems to me heading where were
heading and maybe even moving a little lower if circumstances permit over future meetings is
perfectly consistent and is consistent in the view of the majority of the committee with some pretty
reasonable outcomes for the economy given the shocks were facing and the circumstances were
in whatever it implies for where we are relative to some longrun neutral real rate that might pertain
over ten or twenty years  implied by thatand the vice chairman said this a few minutes agois
that its not clear that the 1 percent real rate has much if any insurance built into it relative to the
kinds of headwinds were facing  i agree that a 1 percent real rate is not sustainable indefinitely but
as i pointed out before we ran with a zero real rate for two years in 92 and 93  i dont think that
had any adverse effects on inflation expectations at the time  we explained why we were doing it
we explained the circumstances that were forcing us into that  we kept our eye on inflation
expectations  you might remember that at the time there was a lot of political pressure that we
should lower the rate even further and we resisted that pressure in part by keeping our eye on
inflation expectations and making sure they werent moving higher
so if circumstances dictate i think we could sustain as the greenbook has us doing a
1 percent real federal funds rate for some time without any adverse effects on inflation expectations
going forward  i dont think 50 implies an unacceptable inflation risk  i think its consistent with
the gradual reduction in inflation that weve outlined in our forecast  in these circumstances we
need to concentrate on addressing the economic and financial stability issues that were facing
thats the bigger risk to economic welfare at this time than the risk that inflation might go higher
and the 50 basis points in my mind is just catching up with the deterioration in the economic
outlook and the financial situation since the end of october  we are just getting to something that
barely takes account of what has happened with very little insurance  now i agree that if we got
into a situation where we went lower then these subtle tradeoffs between risk management and the
inflation outlook would come into play but i dont really see them in play at the level of interest
rates that im suggesting we be at at the end of this meeting under the current circumstances
i do agree with president plosser  we need to think about the circumstances under which
we would begin to take back the easing  in the staff forecast we dont have to think about this for
two years if theyre right  but they may not be right and if we go further and have insurance then
i think thats a more important issue  one point that i took from president evanss discussion was
that there might be a risk in talking about taking it back right now because it would undermine the
effects of the ease you put in place  so as a committee we need to think about the circumstances
its a very subtle and tricky issue  the chairman can perhaps cover this in his testimony and
obviously weve talked about it  it must be reflected in the minutes  but going out front with
hammering in public how were going to take it back is going to undermine the effects of the ease
itself  so we can talk about those circumstances but i think we need to be careful about
overemphasizing the taking it back idea particularly from the current level
im comfortable with the language of alternative b  i think the first sentence of paragraph 4
does help to say that we think weve done something considerable thats going to be helpful  it is a
change from the last thing we put out  removing appreciable in terms of downside risk is also a
change and i agree with that  but i do think there are downside risks even after we move today
and it would be a mistake to avoid that topic  those risks are still going to be there even after the
funds rate is 3 percent until the financial markets begin to stabilize and for more than a few weeks
we had a bit of a head fake in october right  they seemed to be stabilizing  we said the risks
were roughly in balance and then the financial markets collapsed  i think we need a period of
stable financial developments so that we can gauge the effect on the economy before we go to a
balanced risk statement  right now the risks are still tilted toward the downside on real activity and
that should be our focus  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b in the bluebook  if we
cut the federal funds rate a further 50 basis points today we will have done a lot in just a week and a
half but i think these actions do represent an appropriate response to a substantial deterioration in
economic conditions  as i said in my comments on the economic situation i basically agree with
the greenbook forecast for this year and perceive the risks to be to the downside  with the fiscal
package a funds rate of 3 percent will likely promote growth in the second half of this year thats
moderate after a brush with recession in the first half  im comfortable with this action because i
believe our inflation objective is credible and i do have confidence that we will be able to reverse
the accommodation were putting in place when its appropriate to do so  but our discussion does
highlight the important point that alternative b seems to be appropriate monetary policy in the
context of the modal forecast  it just brings the real funds rate down to the greenbook estimate of
neutral around 1 percent  if the economy were to go into a recession additional easing would be
needed and would be appropriate  also as governor kohn and others have emphasized
alternative b still doesnt seem to incorporate much of anything for insurance against recession  so
indeed there is a case for doing more than b  there is a case for a but i wouldnt go there today  i
think we can wait and i think we can watch as developments unfold and monitor data
with respect to language the skew in the risks toward a downside surprise and the possible
need for insurance against that possibility especially if we see some further deterioration in
financial conditionsthat strongly inclines me toward the assessment of risk sentences in
alternative b with their asymmetry toward ease  we need to be absolutely clear to state clearly
today that we recognize the continued existence of downside risk and communicate that we stand
ready to cut further if necessary  therefore i would definitely retain the sentence in alternative b
paragraph 4 that states however downside risks to growth remain  however i could see a case
following president plossers suggestion to substitute the wording from the last sentence of the
december 11 statement to the wording in the last line in alternative b  that is we could substitute
the words will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth for the
words will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks  this seems to me to be a
small change that would taken together with the new first sentence in paragraph 4 slightly dial
down the perceived odds of further cuts relative to the proposed wording in b  even without the
change that president plosser suggested though the fact that we have added the new first sentence
in paragraph 4 does seem to me to change the wording of the assessment of risk enough relative to
our intermeeting statement to communicate to markets that we will view future policy moves after
the one today somewhat differently going forward  todays move and the intermeeting move are
essentially catchup to put us where we think we need to be and moves going forward will respond
to the evolution that we see in the markets
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i can support alternative b down 50 basis points
although as ill try to argue in a moment i dont think it makes a whole lot of difference whether
its down 50 or down 25  i would support the plosser recommendation on paragraph 4 and i would
also note that the statement as its written recognizes the credit market problems and the housing
problems but it seems as though a critic from the outside might say its oblivious to the fact that
inflation rose somewhat last year  so i would propose adding a sentence at the beginning of
paragraph 3 along the following lines  although the inflation rate rose somewhat over the past
year the committee expects inflation to moderate  it seems to me that we should recognize the
fact that inflation rose because its parallel with the recognition of what has been going on in the
credit markets and in the real economy
now let me make a couple of fairly general comments  im very much of the view that the
natural state of the us economy is full employment and output growth at potential  thats where
the economy tends to gravitate and firms and markets respond relatively quickly on the whole to
shocks  a particularly good example was the shock of september 11  in the following three
months the companies shed a million jobs out of nonfarm payrolls responded pretty quickly and
slashed production inventories and in fact it was that shock that ended up creating the case for that
being labeled a recession  without that i dont think it would have been labeled a recession
anyway the shock last august did not lead to a sharp retrenchment in the real economy  putting
housing aside now it aggravated the housing problem that was already under way  firms and
markets are making many necessary adjustments  housing starts are down  house prices are
falling which i think they have to do  banks are raising more capital  risk spreads are rising from
abnormally low levels and lots of other kinds of adjustments are occurring that need to be made and
are ongoing  i just do not see in the data today the sort of in your face data suggesting that the
economy is in recession  it might happen but i dont see it right now  we may not have the luxury
of a policy that avoids recession  we dont know that  our choice may end up being whether we
accept a mild recession this year or whether we follow a policy that is so expansionary that we end
up with some further increase in inflation and a deeper recession later  i have no doubt where i
come down  i would rather take the risk of a mild recession now rather than the risk of an increase
in inflation and a larger recession later
now i said that i didnt think that it made all that much difference whether we choose down
50 or down 25  a number of people have commented on the critical role of communications going
forward to try to stabilize the situation particularly the markets expectations about the federal
reserves monetary policy and the burden here is going to fall primarily 98 percent worth on the
chairman  i think that we need heightened attention to longerrun concerns  so much of the market
commentary seems to revolve around the possibilities of a recession recession recession  i dont
see very much attention to longerrun concerns  i think those longerrun concerns are important
and we need to emphasize them  i think monetary policy needs to be based on our best estimate of
what is happening  we spin out alternative scenarios so that we are prepared for things that might
happen but the actual policy decision has to be based on our best guess as to what is in fact
happening  i think that we are at risk that inflation expectations might rise  we monitor them
closely but once we start to see inflation expectations rising its going to be difficult and costly to
rein them in  its going to create a big problem for us  so we can take some comfort that it hasnt
happened yeti dont think it has happenedbut that doesnt say that we can leave that issue
alone  i think that the recent policy actions and policy statements have not adequately balanced the
nearterm concerns over economic weakness or potential weakness and the longerrun inflation
risks
now this is the question  should we try to indicate to the market that it is now time for a
pause in the funds rate target changes assuming that we go down 50 given that weve now come
down 225 since september  should we try to give that direction  well let me recount a bit of
history here and some around the table particularly don will remember this and may correct what
im saying if i have the details wrong  the fomc has really been struggling with this question of
forward guidance since it first began to issue statements at the conclusion of every meeting  the
first time we did it we were using the bias or tilt language  the very first time we did it there was a
reaction in the marketplace that we regarded as excessive and undesired  that led to the
communications committee that roger ferguson chaired  i sat on that committee and don was
fully involved with that effort which led to the balance of risks language  now my judgment is
that over time the forward guidance that weve used in that balance of risk language has not been
successful  theres always a problem of putting the language in and theres always a problem of
taking it out when you want to take it out without giving impressions that you really dont want to
give  we have always understood around this table that incoming data can change the situation but
the market doesnt know when the incoming data will trump the guidance that is in the statement
hence i think that the statement or a more formal tilt or balance of risks language has created some
of our communications problems  that was clear last fall when we tried to give an indication that
we thought we had done enough for the time being and it was overtaken by incoming data and that
created a lot of problems in the market in understanding where we were coming from  so it seems
to me that wed be better off focusing on as clear an explanation as we can of why we have taken
the actions that we have  thats the best chance we have of providing guidance to the market of
how we might respond under similar circumstances in the future that we cant predict  i think we
need to concentrate on explaining the policy responses  the committees task isand again as i
emphasized i think it falls principally on the chairmanill say to restore because i dont think
that thats an unfair word to use here a greater degree of policy predictability  that cannot mean
unconditional because we dont know how the data and how events are going to move the world
that we have to respond to  but we need to create a better understanding in the market of how the
policy changes are conditional on incoming information given the policy objectives that we share
and that are given to us by the congress  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i favor 50 basis points today  i think that a
3 percent funds rate may be reasonably positioned for the economy given our forecast  thats the
greenbook path assumption  that certainly seemed reasonable and todays data gave us no
indication that reasonably changed that path  i like president geithner did find it remarkable that
riskmanagement paths were not really that different either way  now surely risks abound and its
tough to capture that in models and im all in favor of humility  i just dont know which direction
humility argues for in this casemore action or less action  anyway those are my preferences
we have talked a good bit about the potential of reversing our policy action sooner than we often
have done in the past  i just think that its going to be difficult in the moment  the bluebook path
that ive been looking at has this reversal starting when the unemployment rate is peaking  i think
its unknowable that it is actually the peak  there will be a lot of uncertainty but still thats the
situation that we face and so i sort of accept that  but because of that i would prefer to be a little
more careful about how far down we go  three percent could be the bottom of a funds rate cycle
its very difficult to know  from here on out id like to be hopeful for positive news but mindful of
further deterioration that we would certainly act on
in terms of the statement i guess from some discussions over the weekend i wasnt
expecting to hear much movement in that  but the suggestions of president plosser and president
yellen seem to make a lot of sense from my standpoint  so i think it would be nice if there were a
little more discussion of that and i thought president pooles suggestion on inflation was also
helpful  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  our vice chairman urges humility  i strongly
support that  i agree with president evans that its not obvious that the greater ones humility the
greater one should favor ease  i think we should be humble about the path of inflation going
forward whether its likely to fall on its own  i think we should be humble about our understanding
of the output gap  i think we should be humble about whether thats even a sensible way to think
about how real and monetary phenomena interact  the phillips curve itself embodies a relationship
it is uncertain but it embodies expectations of our future behavior  i think we should be humble
about what those expectations are in the present circumstance  times in the past when weve gotten
in trouble on inflation have often been when we were oversolicitous about weak economic growth
and i think we should be humble about whether weve completely gotten past those inflation
dynamics or not  i think we should be humble about the willingness of our future selves to reverse
course and a lot has been said about that  for some it seems to counsel greater ease now but i
think the opposite argument can be made that the extent to which we think we may be hindered or
feel impeded in raising rates even if we think its warranted in the future should cause us to be
more cautious about lowering rates now  it always seems in recoveries that theres always
something that looks fragile that looks likely to threaten economic growth  you know one month
it will be the commercial paper market and cdo writedowns and this month its monolines  there
will be headwinds  i predict well be talking about headwinds a fair amount in the next couple of
years  but if those are genuinely going to impede us we need to be realistic about that and i think
we need to take it on board now  i agree with president poole  we need to be humble about our
ability to prevent a recession  i think we should also be humble about the extent to which what we
see in terms of both growth and financial markets is presumptively inefficient and needs remedial
action on our part  you spoke several meetings ago i think a year or two ago mr chairman about
our need to retain a concern about inflation but not be seen as inflation nutters  i think we need to
care about financial fragility but not be fragility nutters
if left to my own devices i could have chosen a 25 basis point cut today  i recognize that
would surprise markets but judging from the policy paths that you all have submitted for your
projections a whole lot of us think that were going to have to surprise markets some time in the
year ahead  having said that i can support a 50 basis point cut now  but more broadly i think
inflation is just going to have to keep influencing our policy path  i dont think that episodes of
weakness in real growth mean that we put part of our mandate aside  i think it has to temper the
extent to which we lower rates and temper our behavior on the other side as well  as for semantic
tactics i support president plossers suggestion seconded by president yellen and i support
president pooles suggestion as well
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  we had a fairly extended discussion yesterday
about concerns about the condition of various financial markets and some financial institutions and
their implications for the economic outlook and i certainly share those  in this environment i favor
alternative ba 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target  my own forecast is below
the greenbook forecast for this year and next and so my guess is that were going to wind up
moving further before were done  but that said i dont have enough confidence in my forecast to
advocate that we do more right now
as far as language of alternative b is concerned i am certainly happy in general with what
we have as written and i share president hoenigs view although perhaps for a different reason
that the less we say about inflation right now the better  the reason is that in some sense we
havent adequately expressed to at least some market participants that we understand where the
risks lie right now  in trying to remind people that we are not inflation nutters but are serious about
maintaining price stability weve kind of garbled our message in my opinion and i think people in
the marketplace know this central bank is committed to price stability  i dont think we have to
remind them with every statement  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman ive seen the discount rate tally  ive listened carefully
to all my fellow presidents and to governor kohn  i suspect i know what your fellow governors
are going to recommend  im in a distinct minority at this table  this weekend by the way i
searched the newspapers for something to read that didnt have anything to do with either a rogue
french trader or market volatility or what the great second guessers were blabbing forth at the chat
show in davos and in doing so i happened upon a delightful article  i hope you saw it in the
saturday new york times on the search for a motto that captures the essence of britain  my
favorite was nemo ne inclune lacet which very loosely translated i think means never sit on a
thistle  laughter  well thats where i am  im going to risk sitting on the thistle of opprobrium
for my respective colleagues by making the recommendation that we not change the funds rate and
that we stay right where we are
now for the record i would have supported last weeks 75 basis point cut for the reasons
that it would put us ahead of the curve and bought adequate insurance against a recession  i told
you that directly mr chairman and i mentioned it to governor kohn as well  judging by the
policy rules on page 21 of the bluebook as well as by the adjusted rule that our economist evan
koenig has developed in dallas we are indeed ahead of the curve from the taylor rule standpoint
as we meet today with the rate of 350  as was mentioned earlier we have not been docile  we
have cut rates 175 basis points in a matter of months and weve taken some new initiatives that i
think are constructive and useful  id like to see more along the lines of the taf  to be sure in the
discussion that we had in that emergency meeting i had the same concerns that president hoenig
expressed in the call but with the wording change that was put forward by governor kroszner i
ended up where president hoenig did  i regret not voicing my discomfort with the penultimate
sentence in the statementthe one dealing with appreciable downside risk after the move we
tookas i felt that it undercut the potential effect of our decision  during that call you may recall
that i pointed out the pros and cons  i began my intervention on that call by saying that theres a
very fine line between getting ahead of the curve and creating a sense of panic  i also expressed
concern of the need to be mindful of inflation as many have at this table today  there are some
critics who say we panicked in response to the market selloff of that monday  i do not believe
thats the case and i dont believe its the case because i find it impossible to believe  as ive said
repeatedly in this room other than in theory markets are not efficient and on the banks of the
hudson or the thames or the yangtze river you cannot in practice satisfy the stock market or most
other markets including the fed funds futures market in the middle of a mood swing  when the
market is in the depressive phase of what president lockhart referred to as a bipolar disorder
crafting policy to satisfy it is like feeding jabba the huttdoing so is fruitless if not dangerous
because it simply will insist upon more  but attempting to address the pathology of the underlying
economy is necessary and righteous and thats what we do for a living and i think we are best
sticking with it  were talking about the fed funds rate  i liken the fed funds rate to a good single
malt whiskeyit takes time to have its ameliorative or stimulative effect  laughter
but im also mindful of psychology and thats what i want to devote the remainder of my
comment to and then ill shut up  my ceo contacts tell me that were very close to the creating
panic line  they wonder if we know something that they do not know and the result is in the
words of the ceo of att randall stephenson you guys are talking us into a recession  to
hedge against that risk is something to them unforeseen even after they avail themselves of the
most sophisticated analysis that money can buy  ceos are indeed doing what one might expect
they are tightening the ship  theyre cutting head counts to lower levels  theyre paring back cap
ex where they can beyond the levels they would otherwise consider appropriate after imputing dire
assumptions of the effects of housing  im going to quote tim eller whom i consider the most
experienced and erudite of the big homebuilders which is centex who told me we had just begun
to feel that we were getting somewhat close to at least a sandy bottom  then you cut 75 basis points
and add appreciable downside risks to economic growth remain in your statement and it scares
the beep out of us  he didnt use the word beep  these are his words not mine  imagine
scaring a homebuilder already living in hell  the ceos and cfos i speak to from disney to
walmart to ups to texas instruments cisco burlington northern southwest airlines
comerica frost bank even the ceo of the felicitously named happy state bank in texas
repeated this refrain you must see something that we simply do not see through our own business
eyes  they do see a slowdown  they are worried about the pratfall as i like to call it of housing
theyre well aware of californias and floridas economic implosion and broader hits to consumer
welfare across the national map  i recited some data points from those calls yesterday  but they do
not see us falling off the table  they worry aloud that by our words and deeds we are inciting the
very economic outcome we seek to cut off at the pass by inducing them to further cut costs defer
capex and take other actions to hedge against risk  they cant fathom it but assume that we can
our beige book contacts and the respondents to the business outlook survey in dallas say
pretty much the same thing  one of those actions is to fatten margins by passing on input costs
now i mentioned the rail adjustment factor yesterday and im troubled by the comment that i
quoted yesterday from the ceo of tyson foods  we have no choice but to raise prices
substantially  i mentioned that fritolay has upped its price increase target for 08 to 7 percent
from 3 percent  kimberlyclark notes that it is finding no resistance at all to increasing prices in
both its retail and institutional markets and i mentioned that walmarts leaders confirm that after
years of using their price leadership power to deflate or disinflate the price of basic necessities
think about thisfrom food to shoes to diapers they plan in 2008 to apply that price leadership to
accommodate price increases for 127 million weekly customers  this cant help but influence
inflation expectations among consumers
i experienced a different kind of price shock two weekends ago when i went to buy a
television so i could watch president rosengrens football team demolish president yellens
laughter  i was told that they had doubled their delivery and installation fees because of a fuel
surcharge  well i reminded the store clerk that i had been there about the time of the armynavy
game around thanksgiving and that gas prices had not doubled since the armynavy game and
he said mr fisher were selling less and we will take what we can get away with however we
can get away with it  with oneyearforward consumer expectations according to the michigan
survey already above 3 percent everyone from exxon to valero to hunt oil and our own
economists in the greenbook telling me that oil is likely to stay above 80 and the national average
price therefore above 3 this mindset really worries me  im going to add one more very troubling
little personal anecdote  driving home from work last week i heard a commercial for steinway
pianos  the essence of the advertisement was that manufacturing costs had increased and that you
could buy a piano out of their current inventory at the old price that was in place in 2007 but
come february 1 there would be sizable price increases so youd better purchase your piano
quickly  it has been thirty years since i have seen advertisements to go out and buy now before the
big expected price increases go into effect  now this is an isolated little bitty incident but i fear
this may be just the beginning of the more pervasive use of this tactic
everyone in this room knows how agnostic i am about the predictive value of tips and the
futures instruments comparing tips with nominals like the fiveyear fiveyearforward  ive sent
around an eye popping chart that shows the predictive deficiencies of the professional forecasters
that were tracked by the philadelphia fed  i know that dealers are telling us that inflation is
contained but i have spent many years in the canyons of wall street and i would caution against
their disinterest in the predictions that they offer  when i see that every measure of inflation has
turned up learn from studying the entrails of the last pce that 83 percent of the items therein
experienced a price upswing consider the shortcomings of the few tools we have for evaluating
expectations of future inflation and then hear from microeconomic operators of the economy that
by golly were going to take what we can while the getting is good i cant help but feel that we
cannot afford to let our guard down by becoming more accommodative than we have already
become with our latest move
mr chairman you know because weve talked about this that ive anguished over this  in
fact to be politically incorrect in a government institution i have prayed over it  it is not easy to go
against the will of the people you have enormous respect for but i have an honest difference of
opinion  i truly believe we have it right at 3 percent right now  i think that even with some
important language changes we risk too much by cutting 50 basis points at this juncture and driving
the real rate further into what i perceive even on an expectationsadjusted basis is getting very
close to negative territory  mr chairman i think weve gone as far as is prudent for now and that
3 percent together with the other initiatives weve taken to restore liquidity is sufficient  so i ask
for your forbearance in letting me sit on the thistle of recommending no change
i do want to say as far as the language is concerned since obviously were going to go with
alternative b despite my vote against it that i strongly recommend you consider the changes that
were given by presidents plosser yellen and poole and i would strongly advocate particularly at
the end adding that we will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth
i thank you for paring back alternative b paragraph 3 in terms of getting away from discussing
only energy commodity and other import prices  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a coffee break and come back
at 11 oclock  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we recommence  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b for several reasons not
least of which because it actually seems to reasonably capture what we talked about yesterday  so i
think it has that benefit  to state the obvious we are in a very tough spot  there are clearly risks on
both sides of the mandate and for folks who are of differing opinions i dont think that they would
either deny the tough spot were in or say that we have a lack of worries on either side  i think
president geithner said in the qa at the beginning of this round that were choosing which policy
error were prepared to make or more charitably were deciding where our worries are the greatest
it does strike me that alternative b does that reasonably well  to step back for just a minute i think
that the tough spot were in is a function of issues that were very long in the making and will take a
long time to work out  that probably has two implications  first as to what governor kohn said
its easy for me to feel more comfortable with our judgment by saying that well be able to undo it
really really soon but if it is going to take a long time for this to work out i dont want to take any
false comfort in that  the other implication is that when i say that this is long in the making i
mean particularly for financial institutions  it has taken them a long time to dig themselves into this
hole for the creditintermediation process to be as deeply disturbed as i take it to be at this point  so
when i think about what policies we would make on the monetary policy front i wouldnt want to
excuse or somehow allow them to get off scotfree by going with alternative b i dont think that
would be the case  financial institutions have far more work to do than we have yet to do on
monetary policy  i think they are further from recognizing where they need to get  that will take
some time
in listening to other peoples perspectives on the elixir of a 3 percent fed funds rate i think it
would be a nice luxury to give 3 percent a chance but its probably not practical for the following
reasons  i have tried to convince myself that the monetary policy moves in the last nine or ten days
were a onetime stepfunction change by which we were setting a level based on where we think
the real economy is and we need to get back to normal monetary policymaking  i think dropping
the word appreciable as in alternative b is one way to do so  the goal would be for monetary
policy to get back to sort of normal business in tough times
another point just of commentary is that by taking this action along the lines of alternative
b it would be nice if we werent going to be lowering the value implied by the markets of where
the rate will end up  so my support of alternative b is nonetheless with this worry as wellthat the
markets might think that we have moredramatic actions and that we will have to go lower longer
than is currently implied  i dont mean to give them additional credit there but i dont think that we
have a great alternative  as to the point about market expectations i would note that we willand
necessarily at some level shouldduring the course of our next several meetings disappoint market
expectations and that is not something i think we need to run from  i think that will be part of the
discipline function but this is probably not the right time to do it
as a final point alternative b is consistent with the narrative that weve started based on the
data we saw in middecember based on the chairmans speech earlier this month and based on our
meetings over the past several weeks  it strikes me that it would be prudent at this time of financial
stability risks and uncertainty in the markets for us not to add volatilitynot to throw out a different
nuance or try to be too clever  so while i have sympathy for some of the ideas and amendments
that have been suggested in this discussion weve come to a pretty tough place as i said at the
outset  its a tough fork in the road  we should all feel to some degree uncomfortable about the
choice we make but the choice were making today needs to be as clear as it can be  even if wed
get some comfort in being a little cute a little clever and a little nuanced im afraid we might be
undoing some of the clear bet that we have to put on the table  so with that i support alternative b
as written  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i also support alternative b  i think by any
measure 125 basis points of easing within a month is a lot and perhaps it is a nearly unprecedented
level of insurance that this committee has purchased in such a short period of time  but i think it
makes sense to have done it in these circumstances because we have the risk of a substantial
tightening of credit and financial market conditions  there are still lots of shoes that may be left to
drop and in nellie liangs great phrase yesterday unplanned asset expansions can occur  just
today we heard that ubs increased by 4 billion the report of their expected losses from what they
reported last month and that is not their final report  theyre not going to come out with the final
numbers for another month and so its certainly conceivable that more could be there  the socgen
situation is obviously another thing that is potentially unsettling and so i think its very important to
be buying some insurance particularly when the slowburn scenario that ive talked about for a long
time is the one that i see as the most likely  there is not going to be just some immediate credit
crunch or some immediate problem of impairment of capital at an institution  but just given the
increase in the cost of raising capital given the difficulty of getting things off the books given that
other things have to come on or given just that the old securitization machines that at a given level
of capital sustained a very high level of activity which cant be done now because you cant get the
things off the books the machine cant churn at the same rate that it did even with the same amount
of capital  then with all these other challenges we have to be wary of that  so the fragility is still
there  as we talked about before we had some dramatic improvements in october through early
november of last year and suddenly they reversed and i just dont feel comfortable that i
understand where those went
that said however i think the very recent data that we have gotten provide just a glimmer
of hope  i mean weve had relatively low claims numbers  the adp number was relatively low
im not sure how much information content is in that but with the claims number it makes a not
implausible case that there wouldnt be a dramatic negative number in the employment report and
potentially it could be on the positive side  i dont think gdp is quite so miraculous as we heard
the very humble dave stockton tell us that they nailed it  but also look at some of the places in
which there was some weakness now that may come up next quarter  over the next couple of
quarters probably were going to see a payback in government spending whether its through direct
stimulus or through more expenditures on the military  the advance durable goods number which
no one really mentioned was on the positive side  i dont want to put too much weight on that but
it suggests that there are at least some mixed signals going forward  so i think that means that we
need to leave our options open  we need to worry about those downside risks but we shouldnt
dismiss the possibility that the forecast that dave and the team have put out not only has nailed it for
this quarter but also has not done such a bad job for the quarters going forward
that means we have to think a lot about what we want to say in the statement  how do we
get that balance right  clearly its important that we take out the word appreciable and the
markets will see that  the concern that president fisher raised is a real one  if we continue to talk
about appreciable risks after 125 basis points of cutting in a month i think that would be
unsettling to market participants  but i think the markets are expecting us to take that back
actually if i could just for a moment get clarification from president yellen  my understanding was
that what she suggested about the change to the fourth paragraph and the assessment of risk was to
change only the last sentence back to the december 11 statement
ms yellen  thats correct  i was suggesting changing only the very last sentence
mr kroszner  which is different from what president plosser proposed
ms yellen  he proposed as i recall changing two sentences eliminating the one that
referred to downside risks and also changing the last sentence  i would not want to see the
downside risk sentence eliminated i would change only the very last sentence
mr kroszner  yes i would agree that i would not want to see that sentence changed
im open to the possibility of simply changing the last sentence to go back to december 11  now
that clearly would be taken by the market as a signal that we were moving back
another proposal that has been put on the table is to add something about inflation concerns
or acknowledgement of the inflation situation in the rationale starting off with something like
although inflation pressures remain  id probably end up coming down with president stern on
thatat this point im not sure we gain that much by saying that  that is something we may need
and want to say the next time that we undertake a policy action  im not sure its necessary to do so
now although if there were a strong desire to say something like although inflation pressures
remain i would not be opposed to that  but i do think it might be reasonable to at least consider
moving back to the december 11 formulation for the last sentence of paragraph 4 but thats
certainly a step back  i dont think that closes off options for us going forward but im certainly
open to those concerns because i dont want to close those options off
finally on the broader issue of communications particularly with respect to reversals
something that worries me is that there has been a lot of discussion about japan  after they would
provide more liquidity or a rate cut they would say well we really didnt want to do that and
were going to take this back as soon as we can  so they kept providing more and more liquidity
and it had less and less effect  it was the classic pushing on a string  i think that shows the very
important role of expectations  so at this point given that i think we want to leave our options
open i dont think we want to be emphasizing that  its extremely healthy for us to be discussing
that internally but until we see how things play out im not sure its wise to do that because we
could really undermine the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions  that is the last thing we
want to do because that might force us to go down further than we would otherwise like and cause
more volatility in the markets more uncertainty with more potential for unanchoring expectations
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  as you know from my discussion of the
economy i think that were skirting a recession but i see very large downside risks  when we
looked at the greenbook i agreed with the view that the equilibrium fed funds rate has dropped
substantially at least 125 basis points from the last fomc meeting in december  when i think
about a 50 basis point cut in this meeting which is clearly the consensus of the committee my view
is that it is consistent with the downward revision in the modal forecast but it does not take out any
insurance and this is something that the vice chairman alluded to before
so all else being equal i would actually advocate a 75 basis point cut at this meeting
because i do think there is a need to take out insurance  however there are mitigating factors so i
do not feel as strongly as i did at the full fomc meeting in december when i took the view that we
should take out insurance and aggressively cut more than the consensus of the committee but felt
that dissent would not be helpful in terms of the perceptions of the committee and the federal
reserve and so was willing to vote with the majority  in this case i dont feel as strongly so i am
more comfortable with 50 basis points although everything else being equal i think that insurance
is warranted and i get nervous that we are not getting sufficiently ahead of the curve
so what are the mitigating factors that allow me to be more supportive of the consensus of
the committee  one is that i do worry that markets might think we are panicking  this is the issue
that president fisher raised  a 50 basis point cut would be a cut of 125 basis points in a month
there has been a lot of discussion in the media about our panicking on this so there is a danger in
this regard and that is a mitigating factor for my not pushing hard for a 75 basis point cut  the
second issue is that we saw a sharp move up in inflation compensation after the 75 basis point cut at
the last conference call meeting  actually theres no evidence at all that this was a result of higher
inflation expectations but i do think it illustrated that there was more uncertainty about inflation and
where our longrun inflation goals might be  this is a reason that the committee needs to get to
more clarity on our inflation objectives  you know it is no surprise to people that im not
completely happy with where we are now in terms of the range  exactly in a situation like this just
as in 2003 you may drift up to the top of the band and be happy to stay there or drift to the bottom
of the band and be happy to stay there  i do think there is a cost  this illustrates a cost to our
communications strategy and i hope we would reconsider that at some point in the future
the third mitigating factor is that there is an issue about taking out insurance when the
committee is not completely prepared and we have also not prepared the markets to think about
how we might think about reversals if they were necessary in the future  the whole insurance
strategy is one in which you cant take out insurance and then have it be seen as always easing and
thus unhinge inflation expectations and lose the strong nominal anchor  so the committee has to
think more about conditions under which it would reverse course and actually prepare the markets
for that  as i said there are two kinds of information that i think we get fairly quickly along with
othersparticularly information on inflation expectations and information on whether financial
market strains are easing  i think we need to clarify that in terms of the public  it is a point that
governor kohn made and i want to return to it in a second  but the bottom line is that i support the
50 basis point cut in the funds rate so i support alternative b
on the statement i am probably the only person who likes the alternative a paragraph 3
rationale  but i am sympathetic to president sterns concernsthe less said the betterso im not
going to push it  but i am comfortable saying that inflation expectations are currently well
anchored and that there is some expectation of easing of slack in the economy and so my view is
that the upside risks to inflation are not the serious concern right now  id be willing to state that if
it were me personally but the issue that president stern has raised that maybe the less said the better
is fine with me  again im perfectly comfortable with alternative b as it is written now
one last point which is to address an issue that governor kohn mentioned  i think hes
absolutely right that we should not be saying or thinking that we expect to reverse right now  even
if we actually did a 75 basis point cut at this meeting which were not going to do i would not take
the view that it would mean that we plan to reverse it  when you put these projections out its tough
to indicate that you would be willing to reverse but the reality is that were taking out the insurance
because we think that the financial strains will last for a long time  that is our best prediction and
on that basis to give an impression that we want to take it away would create problems  this is the
issue that governor kroszner talked about in terms of japan where clearly expansionary policy was
not working because they kept saying were going to take it back  as a result from the
viewpoint of expectations the policy was not expansionary  i do think policy needs to be
expansionary at this point  however im not sure that i agree that we should not talk about the
issue of reversals  its a question of the way we talk about it  its not that we expect that we would
be reversing quickly but conditions could change which were not expecting but we really would
like that to happen  wed be hopeful in particular that the financial strain is turned around quickly
which in the past we have seen happen in some cases  in some cases it takes a very long time  the
episode in the early 1990s was one in which those financial strains took a very long time to
dissipate  similarly we dont talk about it as much but in the early aftermath of the 200001
recession there was a sequence of financial strains particularly things like enron and the lack of
confidence that lasted a heck of a long time  so i would say that we do need to think and talk about
it but it is not that we want to reverse it  we are ready to reverse but the conditions must be such
that were actually getting information that tells us that reversals are appropriate  thank you very
much
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  just very quickly given the number of people who have talked about
reversals it seems to me that the minutes need to say something about it because the minutes have
to be true to the ultimate transcript as published
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  let me just say that i am
completely comfortable with the way you just framed the case not just for thinking about and
talking about strategies for how we take this back at the appropriate point but i also dont have any
problem with the way you talked about how youd frame it in public  i thought that was fine
when i talked about the need for humility it was just in our capacity to design optimal strategies for
the timing and the slope of the path to reversal at this stage  i think its going to require more time
a few things about the policy action and the statement  obviously i support 50 and i
support the language in alternative b paragraph 4 as written  the chairman laid out in public
earlier this month a basic strategy that said that policy would be directed at providing an adequate
degree of insurance against the downside risks given the nature of those risks  it was said with
more nuance and eloquence but basically that was the thrust of the strategy  i think that the balance
of evidence we haveeven with all the uncertainty about what equilibrium is what the appropriate
level of the real rate is and what it actually issuggests that we have not gotten policy to that point
therefore getting that strategy in place is likely to require further action  its very hard to know
when or how much  its very hard to know what should frame that choice now for us i think  as
many of you said markets have to go through a further set of adjustments and i think that has to
work through the system  our job again is not to artificially interfere with that process or to
substitute our judgment for what the new equilibrium should be in that context  our job should be
to make sure that adjustment happens without taking too much risk that it tips the financial system
and the economy into a much more perilous state that would be harder for us to correct and require
much more policy response  theres a big difference between a world in which housing prices fall
20 percent and one in which they fall 40  if everybody thinks they have to prepare for a world in
which they fall 40 were going to take much greater risk that we have a scale of financial trauma
and credit crunch that would produce the odds of a deeper recession
what we face now is not the choice as i think president poole said between a mild
recession now and higherthanexpected inflation over time  the risk we face as the chairman said
several times is the choice between a mild short recession and a deeper more protracted outcome
the scale of financial market fragility we now face you could even say solvency in parts of the
financial system is a function of the confidence we create in our willingness to get policy to a point
that provides meaningful protection against an adverse outcome  i think the experience of the past
five or six meetings suggests that we cannot carefully enough design a message that can lean against
expectations in the market about the likely path of policy that we judge to be excessive and that
makes us uncomfortable without taking too much risk that it will just undermine confidence in our
willingness to get policy right  we just dont have that capability  we thought about it and tried it
in lots of different ways but everything we experienced over the past four months justifies the
judgment that we cant lean against those expectations without taking too much risk that we
undermine confidence in our capacity to get policy to the point at which were giving some
insurance
it would be a mistake to try to recalibrate expectations now relative to the stance of policy as
stated in the chairmans statement and our statement last week  it would be a mistake to recalibrate
back to a point that looks more like october  everything we know suggests that its probable that
the data will get still worse from here and that the financial markets will be in a state of considerable
fragility and tenuousness for some time  to sort of zig at this meeting to recalibrate more toward a
sense of balance in the face of that reality just means that were likely to have to zag back again  i
just think that would risk our looking as though were ambivalent and have to correct again because
of that  that would just be uncomfortable  its hard to knowi think governor kroszner said it
right in many many meetingswhether we face the risk of a grinding downward selfreinforcing
set of pressures on balance sheets that raises the risk of deeper trough in housing and creates more
caution and deleveraging and the economy moves slowly down or whether we face the risk of much
more acute cliffs in asset prices with much greater consequences for confidence and the fragility of
the financial system  it is hard to know but i think both would be very uncomfortable for us
again i strongly support the language in b as it is  even though i understand the rationale
id be very uncomfortable with dialing back that statement as it now exists to something that
suggests were closer to balance
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you all  let me make a few comments
the recent period has been more ragged in terms of policy and communications than i would have
liked  in particular during the past few months i think a perception has developed that we are
tentative and indecisive and are not communicating clearly enough to the markets and to the public
now whether thats fair or not that perception is there and has to be addressed  i think we have
begun to address it with our recent communications and the strong policy action that we took last
week  for my part i plan to speak more often and more clearly in public about the economy and
our policy strategy and to do that i will need your continued thoughtful input and support  all that
has happened notwithstanding i think we now have the opportunity to get policy to about the right
place  as we have all noted the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed sharply around
the turn of the year  i am very hopeful that the labor market report this friday will be positive
however as i mentioned yesterday there is as yet no evidence whatsoever that the housing market
is stabilizing as the new home sales data show  so long as house prices keep falling we cannot rule
out some extremely serious downside risks to our economy and to our financial system  we need to
be proactive and forceful not tentative and indecisive in addressing this risk
i recommend a 50 basis point cut at this meeting to 3 percent  this is the value that the
greenbook forecast requires to achieve modest growth later this year and price stability by next
year  a decline of 225 basis points since last august fits well with both constructed indicators like
the staffs mediumterm r as well as market indicators such as shortterm nominal interest rates  a
3 percent funds rate is lower than most taylor rule prescriptions but the taylor rule makes no
allowance for current unsettled conditions in financial markets including spreads and bank capital
constraints which make a given value of the funds rate less accommodative today than it would be
in normal circumstances  in contrast the greenbook analysis attempts to take those financial
conditions into account  even at the 3 percent level assuming that the greenbook analysis is in the
right ballpark we would be making little or no allowance for riskmanagement considerations as
several people have pointed out  for that reason its instructive to note that the greenbook has a
flat path that doesnt reverse and the reason is precisely that theyre in a certaintyequivalent
framework without any insurance having been taken out  if you accept riskmanagement principles
then we should be considering the possibility of cutting below 3 percent and then reversing when
that insurance is no longer needed  however 125 basis points of ease in two weeks is certainly a
good amount and i dont think that going further at this time is advisable
regarding the statement i recommend alternative b  it is very similar to our statement of
last week in the description of the economy  there are two main differences both in paragraph 4
first and very important we acknowledge our two recent policy actions including today and note
that they should lead to moderate economic growth and to mitigation of risks  the latter part is
strictly true because a cut will certainly mitigate risks but it may be read to say that we think weve
taken out a little insurance which is as i said somewhat debatable  thats something we can
discuss in the future  second the downside risks are no longer described as appreciable  i think
both of these steps will serve to moderate expectations of further rate reductions by indicating that
we think that our actions thus far go a substantial distance in addressing the downside risks
i strongly counsel however against taking out the sentence referring to downside risks
first of all its not plausible that downside risks that were appreciable just last week are no longer
an issue today and indeed in the projections that weve submitted the committee overwhelmingly
saw a downside risk to economic growth  we have to be honest about that  second although i
realize what the intent of that change would be which would be to say that were not promising
further cuts it could actually be read in quite the opposite way which is that we are saying were
not making further cuts even if the conditions warrant and that would put us back in the situation
we were in at the end of october when the market was confused about whether or not we were
willing to respond to circumstances  we have to maintain a posture of flexibility and
responsiveness in this fluid situation and drawing a line in the sand is not the way to do that  im
also reluctant to make the other changes that have been suggested  i understand the purposes behind
them but im very conservative about changing wording that has just been used a week ago in a
statement and less than three weeks ago in my speeches  its just so risky to give the impression
that we are changing course when we have just simply now identified the downside risk and have
taken aggressive action in that direction
now i understand that several of you will be quite unhappy with the nature of that
statement and let me try to reassure you in the following way  rather than trying to convey all the
subtleties of our policy strategy in the statementand here i agree with president poole who has
pointed to the limitations of the statementi propose to supplement the message of the statement
as i said by commenting more on the economy and the policy in public speeches and in
testimonies  between now and the next fomc meeting i have a testimony the week after next i
have the humphreyhawkins testimonies and i have a speech and in each of those i will talk about
the economy and the policy strategy that we are taking  in particular subject to your counsel and
individual perhaps even collective consultation in my public speaking i will try to make three
main points
first i will try to reinforce the message of the statement which is that the federal reserve
recognizes the downside risks to economic activity and we are on the case  we have already moved
aggressively and proactively and we are prepared to respond in a timely manner as needed to
mitigate the risks of very bad outcomes  conveying the message that the fed will be active and
willing to mitigate tail risk is critical for achieving financial stabilization which in turn is necessary
for achieving economic stabilization  we have to show that were in touch  butand let me now
address these points in particular to president plosser and others who have raised concernsthe
second point i will make is that the fed is not on autopilot for further rate cuts  monetary policy
takes time to work and our recent actions will do little for the economy over the next few months
thus some weak economic news is to be expected in the near term and is not a prima facie case for
additional easing  instead we will be datadependent in the specific sense that we will respond to
the incoming information that affects the mediumterm outlook and to our assessment of the risks
the third point i will make in my public comments is that to the extent that we are being proactive
in addressing downside risks to the economy we must also be proactive in removing
accommodation once the economy is on a sustainable recovery path and we must be clear about the
circumstances that will prompt that reversal  again in saying this i reiterate that its not clear that
we have yet taken out a great deal of insurance nevertheless i think that point needs to be made
the need for making a policy reversal at an appropriate point which may not be the next six months
but when the conditions warrant is important moreover i think its actually credible  if you look at
the dealer surveys or the fed funds futures they show a hockey stick  they do show a response and
then change coming back later this year or next year
so thats what id like to do  id like to be conservative with the statement  given some of
the problems weve had i dont want to do any right turns or uturns or add any confusion  i want
to continue on message in terms of where we have been in the past few weeks  but recognizing the
subtleties of our policy approach the concerns that we have about inflation and about financial
conditions and economic growth i will be making a concerted effort to try to explain in public the
subtleties of our strategy and of our economic outlook  i hope we can present a united front to the
public behind the strategy to the extent possible  again i appreciate your support and
understanding of the very difficult pressures and conflicting forces that we face  so thats my
recommendation  i would be happy to take any further comments  if none debbie can you call the
roll
ms danker  yes  the vote is on the language for alternative b as it is in the bluebook
and in brians handout and on the directive from the bluebook which i will read
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing
the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent
chairman bernanke                               yes
vice chairman geithner                        yes

governor kohn                                      yes
governor kroszner                                yes
governor mishkin                                 yes
president pianalto                                  yes
president plosser                                    yes
president stern                                       yes
governor warsh                                    yes
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  well take just a very quick recess for
the governors to meet and then well come back for our presentation
meeting recessed
chairman bernanke  okay  lets reconvene  we have a special presentation on
policy issues raised by financial crisis  let me turn to pat parkinson to introduce the presentation
mr parkinson6  thank you mr chairman  the first exhibit provides some background on efforts to analyze the policy issues raised by recent financial developments and an overview of todays briefing  as indicated in the top panel in response to a request from the g7 at its meeting last september the financial stability forum fsf created a working group on market and institutional resilience  the working groups mandate calls for it to develop a diagnosis of the causes of the recent financial market turmoil to identify weaknesses in markets and institutions that merit attention from policymakers and to recommend actions needed to enhance market discipline and institutional resilience  the working group has been asked to prepare a report for consideration by the fsf at its meeting in march so that the fsf can complete a final report to the g7 in april  the presidents working group on financial markets pwg is conducting its own analysis along the same lines and will ensure coordination among the us members of the fsf working group
chairman bernanke vice chairman kohn and president geithner asked the boards staff umbrella group on financial stability to organize and coordinate staff support for their participation in the fsf working group and the pwgs effort  specifically they asked the

6  the materials used by mr parkinson mr gibson ms hirtle mr greenlee and mr angulo are appended to this transcript appendix 6
staff to analyze the nine sets of issues listed in the middle panel  subgroups of staff from the board and the federal reserve bank of new york were formed to address each set of issues and work is well under way on all of them  the first four of these issues will be discussed in todays briefing
as shown in the bottom panel todays briefing will consist of three presentations  i will start by presenting a diagnosis of the underlying reasons that losses on us subprime mortgages triggered a global financial crisis  this diagnosis will suggest that among the most important factors were 1 a loss of investor confidence in the ratings of structured finance products and assetbacked commercial paper abcp which caused structuredcredit markets to seize up and abcp markets to contract and 2 the resulting losses and balance sheet pressures on financial intermediaries especially many of the largest global financial services organizations  in the second presentation mike gibson and beverly hirtle to my left will present an analysis of issues relating to credit rating agencies and investor practices with respect to credit ratings  then further to my left jon greenlee and art angulo will make the final presentation which will focus on riskmanagement weaknesses at large global financial services organizations and the extent to which bank regulatory policies contributed to or failed to mitigate those weaknesses  i should note that also at the table today we have norah barger who worked with art angulo on the regulatory policy issues and brian peters who worked with jon greenlee on the riskmanagement issues
turning to the next exhibit the diagnosis begins with the extremely weak underwriting standards for us adjustablerate subprime mortgages originated between late 2005 and  early 2007  as shown by the solid line in the top left panel as housing prices softened in 2006 and 2007 the delinquency rate for such mortgages soared exceeding 20 percent of the entire outstanding stock by late 2007  in contrast the dashed line shows that the delinquency rate on the stock of outstanding fixedrate subprime mortgages increased only 2 percentage points over the same period to around 7 percent  nearly all of the adjustablerate subprime mortgages were packaged in residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs which were structured in tranches with varying degrees of exposure to credit losses  the top right panel shows indexes of prices of subprime rmbs that are collateralized by mortgages that were originated in the second half of 2006  the blue line shows that prices of bbb minus tranches already had fallen significantly below par in january 2007 and continued to decline throughout last year falling to less than 20 percent of par by late october  prices of aaa tranches the black line which are vulnerable only to very severe credit losses on the underlying subprime mortgages remained near par until midjuly but they slid to around
90 percent of par by early august  after stabilizing for a time they fell more steeply in october and november and now trade at around 70 percent of par
as shown in the middle left panel from 2004 through the first half of 2007 increasing amounts of subprime rmbs were purchased by managers of collateralized debt obligations backed by assetbacked securitiesthat is abs cdos  highgrade cdos purchased subprime rmbs with an average rating of aa whereas mezzanine cdos purchased subprime rmbs with an average rating of bbb  the middle right panel shows the typical ratings at origination of highgrade and mezzanine cdos  in the case of highgrade cdos 5 percent of the securities were rated aaa and a further 88 percent were super senior
tranches which would be exposed to credit losses only if the aaa tranches were wiped out even in the case of the mezzanine cdos the collateral was perceived to be sufficiently strong and diversified that 14 percent of the securities issued were rated aaa at origination and 62 percent were super senior  as delinquencies mounted and prices of rmbs slid well below par the credit rating agencies were forced to downgrade or place on watch for downgrade very large percentages of outstanding abs cdos  the bottom left panel shows that such negative actions were quite frequent throughout the capital structures of both high grade and mezzanine cdos even among the aaarated tranches  moreover the downgrades frequently were severe and implied very substantial writedowns even of some aaa tranches  when this became apparent to investors they lost not only faith in the ratings of abs cdos but also confidence in the ratings of a much broader range of structured securities  likewise sophisticated investors who relied on their own models lost faith in those models as writedowns significantly exceeded what the models led them to expect  as a result large segments of the structuredcredit markets seized up  in particular as shown in the bottom right panel issuance of all types of nonagency rmbs declined substantially over the second half of 2007  although comprehensive data for january are not yet available conversations with market participants suggest there has been very little or no issuance
your next exhibit focuses on two other markets that were affected by a loss of investor confidencethe leveragedloan market and the abcp market  the top left panel of that exhibit shows that spreads on credit default swaps on leveraged loans the solid black line already had come under significant pressure in june  by july these spreads had widened about 150 basis points  investors had become concerned about a substantial buildup of unfunded commitments to extend leveraged loans the dashed blue line which in the us market eventually peaked at 250 billion in july  as shown in the top right panel as many segments of the structuredcredit markets seized up issuance of collateralized loan obligations dropped off significantly in the third quarter adding to the upward pressure on spreads on leveraged loans  nonetheless the clo markets continued to function much more effectively than the nonagency rmbs and abs cdo markets  as shown in the bottom left panel from 2005 to 2007 the us abcp market grew very rapidly  much of the growth was accounted for by conduits that purchased securities including highly rated nonagency rmbs and abs cdo tranches rather than by more traditional multiseller conduits that purchased shortterm corporate and consumer receivables  as investors became aware that some of the underlying collateral consisted of rmbs and abs cdos they pulled back from the abcp market generally even to some extent from the multiseller programs  between july and december total abcp outstanding declined about 350 billion or nearly onethird the bottom right panel provides additional information on the growth of abcp by program type  as shown in the first column during the period of rapid growth from 2005 to july 2007 abcp issued by structuredinvestment vehicles sivs and cdos grew far more rapidly than any other program type  the second column shows that when investors pulled back from the abcp markets those program types shrank especially rapidly  the only program type that declined more rapidly during that period was singleseller programs  the singleseller category included a significant amount of paper issued by nondepository mortgage companies to finance mortgages in their private securitization pipelines and this paper has almost completely run off
the next exhibit focuses on how the seizingup of structuredcredit markets and the contraction of abcp markets adversely affected banks especially many of the largest global banks  as you know a combination of balance sheet pressures concerns about liquidity and concerns about counterparty credit risk made banks reluctant to provide term funding to each other and to other market participants  the top left panel of exhibit 4 lists the principal sources of bank exposures to the recent financial stress  leveragedloan commitments sponsorship of abcp programs and the retention of exposures from underwriting abs cdos  the top right panel shows the banks that were the leading arrangers of leveraged loans in recent years  the three largest us bank holding companies bhcs head this list as spreads widened and liquidity declined in the leveragedloan market these banks became very concerned about potential losses and liquidity pressures from leveragedloan exposures although these exposures were smaller at the us securities firms those firms were even more concerned because of their smaller balance sheet capacity  however to date the adverse impact on banks and securities firms from these exposures has been relatively modest and manageable  the middle left panel shows the leading bank sponsors of global us and european securitiesrelated abcp programsthat is programs that invest in assetbacked securities including sivs securities arbitrage programs and certain hybrid programs  as the conduits that issued the abcp encountered difficulty rolling their paper over many of these banks fearful of damage to their reputations elected to purchase assets from the conduits or extend credit to them which proved in many cases to be a significant source of balance sheet pressures  this list is dominated by european banks  indeed the only us bank among the top nineteen sponsors is citigroup  however citigroup was the largest sponsor of sivs which in addition to issuing abcp issue substantial amounts of mediumterm notes  citigroup like nearly all siv sponsors eventually felt obliged to provide full liquidity support for all the liabilities of its sivs which amounted to around
60 billion at yearend  the memo item shows that some other us banks sponsored securitiesrelated abcp programs that were relatively small in absolute terms but significant as a share of their total assets

but losses from leveragedloan commitments and conduit sponsorship have paled in comparison to the losses some banks and securities firms have incurred from the retention of super senior exposures from abs cdos  these include exposures that the underwriters never sold exposures that originally were funded by abcp issued by the cdos that was supported by liquidity facilities provided by the underwriters and relatively small amounts of exposures purchased from affiliated money funds for reputational reasons  the middle right panel shows the leading underwriters of abs cdos in 200607  merrill lynch citigroup and ubs head the list  each of those firms has suffered very large subprime cdorelated losses and citigroup and ubs still reported very significant exposures at yearend  as shown in the memo items among the other very largest us bank holding companies only bank of america has suffered significant losses or still has significant exposures from underwriting abs cdos  i should note that the exposures shown in the exhibit are net of hedges purchased from financial guarantors and most of these firms have hedged a significant portion of their exposure  as you know there are concerns about the ability of  the guarantors to honor their obligations under the hedging contracts  indeed some firms have begun to write down the value of their hedges with the most troubled financial guarantors
the bottom left panel shows total riskbased capital ratios for the four largest us bank holding companies  all four remained comfortably above the 10 percent minimum for well capitalized companies at yearend  of course citigroup was able to do so only by raising substantial amounts of capital at a relatively high cost and each of the other companies also announced capitalraising efforts  moreover citigroups yearend ratio of tangible common equity to riskweighted managed assets was 57 percent well below the 65 percent target ratio that several of the rating agencies monitor and that citigroup seeks to meet  the bottom right panel shows credit default swap spreads for the three largest us bhcs  on balance spreads for all three have moved up about 60 to 70 basis points since the market turmoil began  the spread for citigroup has been elevated since october when investors began to become aware of its subprime cdo exposures  the spreads for bank of america and jpmorgan were in line with a broad index of bank spreads at yearend but jumped in early january on bank of americas announcement of its planned acquisition of countrywide and jpmorgans announcement of substantial additions to its loanloss reserves  spreads for all three companies fell back more in line with the index last week  thank you  i will now take your questions on this presentation before you proceed to mike and beverlys presentation
chairman bernanke  are there questions for pat  president lacker
mr lacker  you characterized underwriting as weak and i guess the document
circulated had some heavy criticism for the credit rating agencies  i want to understand more what
the nature of that assessment involves  basically is it ex post regret or do we have objective
evidence about the quality of the decisionmaking ex ante  that evidence of course would involve
assessments of the probability they should have placed on things we saw
mr parkinson  mike is going to address that in his briefing  i guess id prefer to delay
and just simply say that i think we can point to aspects of their methodology that look fairly weak so
that it wasnt simply an ex post result but one that should have been foreseen at least to a degree if
they had had a stronger methodology ex ante  obviously thats monday morning quarterbacking
but still you can point to specific things that were weaknesses
mr lacker  okay
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  i have a question on exhibit 2 the top right corner  are those aaa
examples rated as of january 1
mr parkinson  i think that was the rating at origination
mr poole  at origination not afterward  okay  the other question i have is really a
comment  on exhibit 1 the middle panel it seems to me something that needs to be explored here
given that this is not the first time that banks have made a lot of bad bets is the way in which the
management incentives are designed  i just get the impressionand there has been some stuff in
the paper recently the wall street journal or somewherethat a lot of people are really given
incentives to push these products and to make these deals  they walk away with big bonuses and
who in the heck cares what happens some time later  so i think that the management incentives are
something very important to investigate in order to have an idea of how that works and we might
be of some assistance in designing something that would be helpful here
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  yes  your exhibit 4 and your riskbased capital ratios fourth quarter are
those as of december 31
mr parkinson  yes
mr hoenig  okay  and do these reflect losses already taken in capital rates
mr parkinson  yes  they reflect the developments in terms of the changes in their
financial statements during the fourth quarter until the yearend
mr hoenig  okay  thank you
chairman bernanke  do you have a question president yellen
ms yellen  i wanted to support president pooles comment  i remember very well back
at jackson hole in 2005 that raghuram rajan presented a paper in which he emphasized the
misalignment of incentives between investors and managers and the fact that almost everyone down
the line right up to the investors themselves should have had incentives here  i dont know what
they were thinking but everybody was rewarded for the quantity and not the quality of originations
he warned us before any of this happened that this could come to no good and i think he did have
some suggestions about compensation practices  these were not popular suggestions  so i think
this is worth some thought  i dont know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices
maybe the market will attend to them but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms
and busts in which this type of incentive played a role  your presentation and the paper started from
the fact that you note the deterioration in underwriting but we should go one step backward  i
suppose another issue here is what we saw in our supervision and whether we acted appropriately
given what we saw  that raises a number of issues that i wont go into at the moment but that i
think we need to be sensitive to
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  just a question on exhibit 4 the bottom two panels  you have the four
banks there and when you look at the capital ratios it doesnt look that discouraging  but when i
look at the credit default swaps it looks a little less encouraging  so if i put wachovia on this i
believe wachovias credit default swaps now are up to 166 which would be much higher than your
scale is right now  so it would be interesting actually to add wachovia to that list  the second
thing is what you take from the fact that the capital ratios dont look so bad but the credit default
swaps and what the markets are looking at indicate that in the past month and a half people
despite the capital infusionsare actually exhibiting more concern about the default experiences
that might occur
mr parkinson  right  well particularly with respect to developments in the last
month or two obviously the economic outlook is cloudier  as you know i dont think we try to
reflect that fully in the capital ratios and there is an element of stress testing and whatnot but your
other important effects are essentially looking through the cycle  so that may be part of it  also if
you look at the credit default swap spread behavior compared with that for lots of other financial
intermediaries out there these look like very modest changes  i dont knowif mike or someone
could help me outto what extent these would translate into significant increases in actual implied
default probabilities but i wouldnt think it would be all that large an increase
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you  i agree with president poole and president
yellen about the need to focus on compensation structures and incentives but just two observations
one is that if you look at compensation practices among the guys who actually look as though they
did pretty well against those who didnt do so wellim not talking about in a mortgageorigination
sense but in the major global financial institutionsthe structure of compensation doesnt vary that
much  what varies a lot is how well people control for the inherent problems in the basic
compensation structures  remember raghus presentation was mostly about hedge fund
compensation and i think he is mostly wrong when you think about that and the incentive structure
the difference really is how you design your limits to make sure that your traders incentives are
more aligned with the incentives of the firm as a whole  the biggest errors and differences are in
the design of the process of the checks and balances to compensate for the inherent problems in the
compensation structure  thats important to know because a lot of these things if you look at the
formal attributes of the riskmanagement governance structure across these firms dont look that
different  what distinguishes how well the guys did is much more subtle around culture
independence and the quality of judgment exercised at the senior level and this is important
because when you think about what you can do through supervision and regulation to affect that
stuff is hard
i have a question for pat  pat not to overdo this but where do you put in your diagnosis of
contributing factors the constellation of financial conditions that prevailed during the boom and
what those did to housing prices  you know theres a tendency for everybody to look at regulation
and supervision and the incentives that they have created or failed to mitigate but there is a
reasonable view of the world that you wouldnt have had the pattern of underwriting standards of
mortgages without the trajectory of house prices that occurred  sure maybe what happened in the
late stage of the mortgageorigination process contributed to the upside but if you look at a chart
the rate of houseprice appreciation started to decelerate about the time you had the worst erosion in
underwriting practices  anyway my basic question is where do you put the constellation of
financial conditions not so much just what the fed was doing but what was happening globally that
affected long rates expectations of future rates et cetera
mr parkinson  well partly what i would say in general about the pricing of risk is
that many many people including people in the federal reserve were concerned about how
narrow spreads were were concerned about some of the slippage of practices and were predicting
that trouble lay ahead  butand im certainly speaking for myselfi never expected this
magnitude of trouble  what ive been focusing on are some of the factors that essentially made a
bad situation much worse than we expected it to be  but there is no question that we entered the
period with risk being priced very cheaply and a fundamental reassessment of risk  again i think
that shouldnt have surprised anyone but almost everyone except the most extreme pessimists has
been surprised by just how much trouble that repricing of risk has caused  some things that we
have focused on certainly were not anticipated and we think they made the situation markedly
worse than we expected it to be
chairman bernanke  are there other questions for pat  okay  we can continue the
presentation
mr gibson  as noted in the top left panel of exhibit 5 we would like to stress two key points on the rating agency and investor issues  first credit rating agencies are one of the weak links that helped a relatively small shock in the subprime mortgage market spread so widely though certainly not the only one  this is not just our staff working groups viewmost market participants have also expressed the opinion that rating agencies deserve some of the blame  second the way that some investors use ratings for their own risk management has not kept up with financial innovations such as the growth of structured finance  these financial innovations have made a credit rating less reliable as a sufficient statistic for risk  the top right panel provides a roadmap to our presentation  to start ill expand on some of the points that pat made on the role of rating agencies in the financial crisis  my aim is to show why credit rating agencies were a weak link which will lead naturally to our recommendations on rating agency practices  as we go ill point out several places where the rating agency issues link up with the investor practices issues that youll hear about next from bev  we feel strongly that the ratings and investor issues are really just two angles on the same underlying issue
the crisis began in the subprime market the subject of the next panel  the subprime mess happenedand keeps getting worsein part because of the issues associated with rating agencies though as i said earlier there is plenty of blame to go around  our staff working group was asked whether the rating agencies got it wrong when they rated subprime rmbs  the answer is yesthey got it wrong  rating agencies badly underestimated the risk of subprime rmbs  last year moodys downgraded 35 percent of the firstlien subprime rmbs issued in 2006 the average size of these subprime rmbs downgrades was two broad rating categoriesfor example a downgrade from a to bbcompared with the historical average downgrade of 1 broad rating categories  as indicated in the exhibit the rating methodologies for subprime were flawed because the rating agencies relied too much on historical data at several points in their analysis  first the rating agencies underestimated how severe a housing downturn could become  second rating agencies underestimated how poorly subprime loans would perform when house prices fell because they relied on historical data that did not contain any periods of falling house prices  third the subprime market had changed over time making the originator matter more for the performance of subprime loans but rating agencies did not factor the identity of the originator into their ratings  fourth the rating agencies did not consider the risk that refinancing opportunities would probably dry up in whatever stress event seriously threatened the subprime market  of course the rating agencies were not alone in this  many others misjudged these risks as well  some
have suggested that conflicts of interest were a factor in the poor performance of rating agencies  while conflicts of interest at rating agencies certainly do exist because the rating is paid for by the issuer we didnt see evidence that conflicts affected ratings  that said we also cannot say that conflicts were not a factor  the sec currently has examinations under way at the rating agencies to gather the detailed information that is needed to check whether conflicts had a significant effect
in the next panel i turn to the abs cdos that had invested heavily in subprime rating agencies got it wrong for abs cdos  the downgrade rate of abs cdos in 2007 was worse than the previous historical worst case just as it was for subprime aaa tranches of abs cdos turned out to be remarkably vulnerable  last year twentyseven aaa tranches were downgraded all the way from aaa to below investment grade  as indicated in the exhibit the main reason that rating agencies  got it wrong for abs cdos was that their rating models were very crude  rating agencies used corporate cdo models to rate abs cdos  they had no data to estimate the correlation of defaults across assetbacked securities  despite the many flaws of credit ratings as a sufficient statistic for credit risk the rating agencies used ratings as the main measure of the quality of the subprime rmbs that the abs cdos invested in  and the rating agencies did only limited ad hoc analysis of how the timing of cash flows affects the risk of abs cdo tranches  as a result the ratings of abs cdos should have been viewed as highly uncertain  as one risk manager put it abs cdos were model risk squared  a final point on abs cdos is that the markets reaction to the poor performance of abs cdos makes it clear that some investors did not understand the differences between corporate and structuredfinance ratings  because structuredfinance securities are built on diversified portfolios they have more systematic risk and less idiosyncratic risk than corporate securities  they will naturally be more sensitive to macroeconomic risk factors like house prices and by design downgrades of structuredfinance securities will be more correlated and larger than downgrades of corporate bonds
turning to the bottom panel as pat noted in august of last year the subprime shock hit the abcp markets especially markets for abcp issued by sivs  rating agencies also got it wrong for the sivs  more than twothirds of the sivs commercial paper has been downgraded or has defaulted  the problem with the ratings was that the rating agencies models for sivs relied on a rapid liquidation of the sivs assets to shield the sivs senior debt from losses  while this might have worked if a single siv got into trouble the market would not have been able to absorb a rapid liquidation by all sivs at the same time  once investors began to understand the rating model for sivs even sivs with no subprime exposure could not roll over their commercial paper  investors who thought they were taking on credit risk became uncomfortable with the market risk and liquidity risk that are inherent in a sivs business model
the next exhibit presents the staff subgroups recommendations for addressing the weaknesses in credit ratings for structuredcredit products  a common theme of our recommendations is drawing sharper distinctions between corporate ratings and
structuredfinance ratings  first we recommend that rating agencies should differentiate structuredfinance ratings from corporate ratings by providing additional measures of the risk or leverage of structuredfinance securities to the market along with the rating  we dont make a specific recommendation on exactly what measures of risk or leverage because we believe rating agencies and investors should work out the details together on this and the recommendations to follow  second rating agencies should convey a ratings uncertainty in an understandable way  the ratings of abs cdos were highly uncertain because the models were so crude  this is what i call the barry bonds solutionput an asterisk on the rating if you have doubts about the quality  laughter  third we recommend more transparency from rating agencies for structuredfinance ratings  what we need is not just a tweak to the existing transparency but a whole new paradigm that actually helps investors get the information they want and need  for example why cant the rating agency pass on to investors along with its rating all the information it got from the issuer that it used to assign the rating  fourth we recommend that rating agencies be conservative when they rate new or evolving asset classes  fifth the rating agencies should enhance their rating frameworks for structured products  for example when they rate rmbs they should consider the originator as well as the servicer as an important risk factor our last recommendation is addressed to regulators including the federal reserve
when we reference a rating we should differentiate better between corporate and structuredfinance ratings  sometimes we do that already but we could provide some leadership to the market by doing more  now bev will discuss the work on investor practices
ms hirtle  mike has described how the rating agencies treated structured credit products a closely related issue is how investors used these ratings  did investors rely too much on ratings in making their investment decisions  did they take false comfort from ratings and not really appreciate the risks they were  assuming leading to excessive growth of the market for subprime structured credit as noted in the top panel of exhibit 7 our approach was to examine these questions through the lens of one representative type of institutional investor  public pension funds  public pension funds are an informative example of investor use and misuse of credit ratings for several reasons  first public pension boards of directors are composed largely of representatives of the employees and retirees covered by the pension plan and have only limited financial expertise in some cases  second survey evidence suggests that a high portion of these funds use credit ratings in their investment guidelines  finally relative to some other investors many public pension funds provide significant public information about their activities  while we need to be cautious in generalizing we believe that practices in the pension fund sector reflect the tensions faced by other institutional investors in making risk assessments and investment decisions  we examined the investment practices and fund governance of 11 public pension plans  these plans ranged from the largest fundcalpers with
250 billion in assetsto six much smaller plans with assets of 6 billion to
11 billion  we used the funds 2006 comprehensive annual financial reports which were generally the most recent available and the funds websites to generate our information  we focused specifically on the funds fixedincome segments since this
is the asset class in which structuredcredit products would likely be held and for which credit ratings are used
the middle panel lists some key conclusions from this review  the first is that these funds have developed workable market solutions to address inexperience or lack of financial sophistication among their managers and board members  these include hiring professional investment managers to make investment decisions on their behalf and perhaps as significantly hiring investment consultants to structure assetallocation strategies to select investment managers and develop mandates guiding their actions and to monitor and assess fund performance  while these funds clearly obtain significant professional advice in managing their investments our review suggests several ways in which these arrangements could be improved in light of recent financial innovation  specifically the mandates guiding investment managers have not always kept pace with the growth of structuredcredit markets
these mandates typically require managers to meet or exceed returns on a benchmark index or of a peer group of investment managers while constraining the risk the managers may assume  credit ratings play an important role in these risk constraintsfor instance by imposing a minimum average rating for the portfolio or a minimum rating on individual securities  however few of the funds we profiled made significant distinctions between structuredcredit and other securities in these creditratingbased constraints although there were sometimes other limits on the aggregate share of assetbacked positions  the failure to make this distinction provides scope for investment managers to generate higher returns by moving into structuredcredit products without raising warning signals about the additional risk these positions entail  this is not necessarily a nave use of credit ratings by investment managers as they could well have recognized that higheryielding structuredcredit products embodied significant additional risk relative to similarly rated corporate debt  instead it reflects a previously effective mechanism used by fund boards to convey risk appetite to these managers falling outofdate with the emergence and rapid growth of a new form of credit instrument
as indicated in the bottom panel our key recommendation is that the pension fund industry and other investors should reevaluate the use of credit ratings in investment mandates  in a narrow sense these mandates should distinguish between ratings on structured credit and those on more traditional corporate credit  however the more fundamental point is that mandates would do a better job of enforcing desired risk limits on the overall portfolio if they acknowledged differences in risk return and correlation across instruments rather than relying on generic credit ratings a second important point is that investors should ensure that their investment consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of credit ratings for the types of positions in their portfolios  this is particularly important if mandates guiding investment manager behavior feature credit ratings as a key risk constraint
that completes our prepared remarks  we would be happy to take your questions before we proceed to the final presentation
chairman bernanke  questions  president lacker
mr lacker  i am still confused  how much of these weaknesses would have been
identified by an impartial observer in january 2006 say without knowledge of what has
happened since then
mr gibson  are you talking about the credit rating agency weaknesses
mr lacker  yes
mr gibson  there are plenty of investors who said we are staying out of that abs
cdo market because we dont trust the ratings and we dont think we have an ability to model
it  but there are also enough who were willing to take on that risk  so i think it is a
combination
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  going back to exhibit 5 the second panel your point that we have no
evidence of conflicts of interest having an effect on ratings i am thinking about the investor
practices presentation  there is an inherent conflict of interest because the issuers pay the raters
by one account moodys earned 44 percent of their revenue in 2006 from rating structured
products  i have always wonderedand by the way i have been on the side of the table that has
worked a rating agency and have gotten what i wantedwhat about just a common sense
solution which is that the investors rather than the issuers pay the rating agencies
mr gibson  that used to be the way it was before 1970the investors paid  i think
the common explanation for why that model faded was that once photocopy machines came into
existence there was no way to constrain the information that they were providing just to
subscribers
mr fisher  i am well aware of that  but is there an inherent conflict of interest in the
process
mr gibson  there is  we are not denying that there is a conflict of interest  we
looked at some of the mechanisms that rating agencies have put in place to address conflicts of
interest and that is something that every rating agency is aware of  the only question is whether
the mechanisms that are in place to address conflicts of interest were working or whether they
need to be enhanced  our conclusion was that we dont really have the detailed information to
know whether there were specific conflicts of interest and we are looking to the sec to provide
that detailed information  but lots of other things seemed to go wrong with the rating agencies
that dont rely on conflicts of interest as an explanation  i think people who have looked at the
question of the issuers paying versus the investors paying feel that given how costly it is to rate
these things even in the mediocre way that it has been done it would be difficult to generate
enough revenue through a pure investorpay model  that is not to say there couldnt be more
competition between the two kinds and there are some proposals out there to do that
mr fisher  again remember how costly it has proven to investors to have that built
in conflict of interest  thats all  thats my say
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  actually i wanted to focus on the same issueconflict of interest
this is something i did a little work on in the past  when you look at the standard corporate
ratings market the move to have the issuer pay really did not create a problem in the market
there clearly is an inherent conflict of interest but there are things that can counter thatin
particular reputation
mr fisher  arthur andersen
mr mishkin  we could talk about arthur andersen too because i am going to talk
about the more complicated issues of conflicts of interest  with plain vanilla conflicts of
interest if there is enough information the market frequently can solve the problem because if
you know that if you do what the issuer wants and you give a good rating then you lose your
reputation  then if it has no value issuers wont pay for it  what is interesting here is that for
the subprime market you didnt find any evidence of conflicts of interest and i am not surprised
by that because those securities are much more straightforward  where i really do worry about
the conflict of interest is in the structured products because one thing that happened was that it
became less plain vanilla  you actually had consulting practices inside the credit rating
agencies these structures are very complicated and you need to slice here and dice here and
consultants were providing advice on structuring them and making a lot of money and then it
was much less transparent  what i wondered about here is that you didnt say this for the first
one subprime rmbs  you said you didnt find the evidence  i buy that  but what about the
cdos and the sivs for which i would expect that this problem would have been more severe
in the book that i wrote with others on conflicts of interest in the financial services industry we
actually said that there was not a problem with the plain vanilla products because the markets
have the information but we worried about exactly this issue in terms of the structured products
i am just wondering whether or not it was an accident that you said for the plain vanilla that there
was less problem  could there have been an issue here  the reason this gets complicated is that
the standard view of conflicts of interest in arthur andersen was in the firms compensation
scheme  actually the conflict of interest was that the texas unit did not worry about and
weakenednot their ethics but what is it  the center has rules for its branches so that they
dont screw the overall firm and that is what got weakened during the fight between the
consulting part and the auditing part
so do you have any information on these very complicated elements particularly the
nontransparent parts  was it an accident that you said for subprime that you didnt find
evidence and for these is there more possibility that there was a problem  that really does have
important implications for the nature of the regulation and accreditation agencies and also their
ability to give good ratings for these very complex nontransparent products  you talked about
investor practices later bev when you said that we should differentiate between plain vanilla
and this very complex stuff  i dont know whether or not you have views on this
mr gibson  there is certainly a possibility that conflicts of interest were occurring in
all these areas  we are taking a somewhat neutral position because we dont really have the
detailed information to say more
mr mishkin  right  but this is the typical federal reserve cautiousness and i am
pushing you a little harder
mr gibson  i know but i am a federal reserve economist  i would agree with your
point that separating out these nonrating businesses from the rating businesses is important and
rating agencies have announced some changes along these lines  when we looked at our
recommendations we didnt really feel as though even if they separated out rating businesses
from nonrating businesses and even if they did all the things that people who are concerned
about conflicts of interest want them to do it would solve the problem
mr mishkin  there would still be problems
mr gibson  we think the real problem is that they didnt differentiate well enough
between structuredfinance ratings and corporate ratings and that is where we would like to put
the focus  securities regulators are already focused on conflicts of interest and there are codes
of conduct regarding how rating agencies have to behave and those are monitored  so coupled
with the secs already doing examinations that wasnt an area we chose to focus on but we
really cant say for sure what was going on
mr mishkin  one quick followup on thatis one implication that we might take
from this that structured products are just so complicated that they may never get good ratings or
sufficiently good ratings so the market really has to shrink  could the rating agencies just fix
themselves up so that they actually could do decent ratings  im trying to get a feel for this  it
really relates to the issue that bev raised which is you want to differentiate between the two
but is there something inherently problematic so that maybe people should just realize that these
structured products are just not such a great thing  financial engineering can go too far
mr gibson  i agree  in fact abs cdos are disappearing or have disappeared
investors dont have any appetite for them  sivs are disappearing as well
mr mishkin  but they could come back  i think subprime lending will come back
under a different business model
mr gibson  really the question is what sort of market forces would produce that
outcome  it certainly seems as though things should move in that direction and we feel that
some of the recommendations we are making on the differentiation between structuredfinance
securities and corporate securities would encourage the rating agencies to put more scrutiny on
the structuredfinance side of it  yes those ratings should be lower especially when you factor
in things like the complexity and the uncertainty
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  my comment is on the conflicts of interest as well  the only thing i
would like to add is that this is not the first time the rating agencies have miscalculated the risk
and put that out there  the incentives are designed to do exactly that and it will occur again  i
think this statement is too generous to the rating agencies  the incentives are driving them to do
this they did it and they will do it again in the future  it is just inherent that when you are going
to make that kind of money and if you can get it down to working with them and pushing this
stuff out it really is a matter for those who use them that you get what you pay for
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  i didnt know anything about sivs before last summer but i must say when i
began to learn something about them i was astonished because it would seem to me that in finance
101 you dont finance longterm risky assets with shortdated paper  theres a maturity mismatch
and theres a rollover risk and weve known about that kind of thing for 100 years i suppose  so
my question is could these things have been marketed as standalone entities without the banks
sponsorship which was there in i guess most cases  second if they wouldnt really fly as
standalone entities it would seem to me that the regulators should have insisted that they be
consolidated on the books of the bank
mr gibson  a lot of the sivs were standalone entities managed by independent asset
management companies that were set up to do that
mr poole  and they collapsed
mr gibson  all the sivs are in the process of winding down now and in the immediate
aftermath of what happened in august that was when there was a crunch in the abcp market
mr poole  but when you say the assetmanagement companies are they providing at
least in principle some liquidity support or something
mr gibson  sivs had partial liquidity backup lines from banks covering one weeks
maximum withdrawal or two weeks maximum withdrawal  that was the way to a rating  the
sivs were operating under the regulation of the rating agencies  the rating agencies modeled their
portfolios and they modeled the inflows and outflows so i think its fair to blame the rating
agencies at least partially for allowing the sivs to grow to 400 billion or whatever it was
mr peters  there is a large independent siv not affiliated with a bank named gordian
knot that is still in existence  its under severe pressure but it has been weathering the storm  one
can argue it might have been more conservative than some of the other sivs
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  my question is on exhibit 6 and the question is
are we making any progress here  in particular are the rating agencies stepping up to the process
of doing different ratings different nomenclature for the structured finance  my impression is that
there is a lot of resistance at least there was as of a few weeks ago
mr gibson  your impression may be more informed than mine but i would say that the
rating agencies are doing a lot of selfexamination now  i havent seen them willing in my opinion
to go far enough in the directions that weve outlined  a lot of their recommendations focus on
managing conflicts of interest and doing a better job of separating compensation from the rating and
things like that  i would say that i havent seen enough on the sort of recommendations that we are
pushing
chairman bernanke  did you have any questions
mr warsh  id add only that i think where the rating agencies are now is trying to come
up with cleaner boxes and better governancesarbanesoxley types of structures ombudsmen
liaisons chinese walls  the core issues that mike and his team bring up seem highly resistant to
change but you know there will be nothing like three months of public hearings if not hangings
laughter  that could change that dynamic but thats in the early stages
mr mishkin  torture works
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  a few different points  one on the conflict of interest issue with
respect to traditional corporate credits it seems that credit rating agencies do pretty darn well and
certainly have done very well before this  so its clear that its not just fundamental to the model
that it cant work  i think its clear enough to remind people of that and that people trusted those
ratings throughout all the turbulence during the summertime  but that said it gets back to some of
the other points that have been raised  what was special about these particular areas that led to a
breakdown  the question is well why did they have bad models  if they were able to develop
good models for these other things in principle they are capable of developing good models but
they seem to have developed poor models here  now that could be succumbing to a conflict of
interest or it could be something specific in this area
i am reminded that another area in which they are perceived to have done a very poor job
was in sovereign ratings back a couple of decades ago  i dont know whether its worthwhile to
drill down into the characteristics of where this model seems to be successful and doesnt seem to
be subject to significant conflicts of interest or where it does whether it relates to particular
information issues  also one thought that i had with respect to these structured productsand you
should tell me whether this is true or notis that most times when a corporation comes to get a
rating theyve decided to issue a particular securitythat is if gm comes their cfo has decided to
issue tenyear debt  if you come to a credit rating agency however the credit rating agency can
say well why dont you issue six securities rather than one  if we chop it up in these different
ways i can make more revenues off that so i have more of an incentive to work with you on this
mr gibson  i definitely agree with you that its more difficult to rate structuredfinance
securities than corporate securities because with structuredfinance securities you have a lot of
quantitative modeling of future cash flows with a lot of uncertainty  clearly the abs cdos are
very complicated structures because its a twolayer securitizationa securitization that invests in
securitizationsand the rating agencies didnt drill all the way down to model the ultimate
underlying loans  they relied on simplifying assumptions and aggregations that were very crude
but because they were branded as cdos people usually understood them to be corporate cdos
that invest in 100 corporate bonds which is a simpler onelayer structure  so the rating agencies
were willing to rate these much more complicated things and investment banks were willing to
market them to investors who were willing to buy them because they all were willing to believe that
a cdo is a cdo is a cdo and in fact that wasnt really true
mr kroszner  yes it might just be interesting to drill down and see where the
successes are and where they havent been successful and whether it has something to do with the
model
mr gibson  oh its definitely not a random sample of asset classes that we chose to
look at  the rating agencies have done a great job in many other places i agree
mr kroszner  right but just thinking about those differences i think sometimes the
rating agencies may be excessively maligned  they actually do provide something thats very
useful and we dont want to throw the baby out with the bath water  but also on that there is a
severe lack of competition among rating agencies and weve tried to address that through some
legislation which doesnt seem to have been very successful at addressing that issue  this is getting
back to governor mishkins point and some other points about why competition doesnt get us to a
better solution  it seems that part of it is a regulatory structure that strongly discourages
competition  did you think about addressing that issue
mr gibson  the regulatory structure has been changed now as a result of the law that
was passed in 2006 at least if youre talking about getting the regulatory stamp of approval from the
sec to become a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  thats now just a notification
process by which if you meet some minimum requirements the sec is required to okay you  so
entry is now easy whereas before it used to be restricted by the sec  in some sense theres a bit of
a natural monopoly going on because if you really had a couple of rating agencies that you trusted
its not clear why someone would be willing to transfer from an established to a new one  but if
you were to take some of our recommendations to the next level and talk about how you would
actually implement this and how you would go about making this have some success one thing
people have suggested is that maybe we should help investors set up their own rating agencies
maybe they dont want to do that nowand maybe more transparency from the existing rating
agencies and from the issuers  it would then be easier for a new rating agency thats funded by
investors to get going and get some traction if there were more transparency around the whole
process  thats just one possibility
mr kroszner  for sure although i think we tried something like that with the
sarbanesoxley issues of independent researchbecause this in some sense is a parallel to
independent researchand even required funding of that and that doesnt really seem to have taken
off  so it seems as though the model even with its flaws is the only one that seems to be
sustainable  but drilling down more into where those flaws are in some sense were seeing a
privatizationim not quite sure what the right word iswith some of the very sophisticated
investors effectively building their own internal credit rating agencies  thats what hedge funds do
and so youre getting in some sense a loss of the public ratinga kind of free rider problem or
whatever is the right way to characterize it  in some sense there may be a loss because youre
getting this to be just purely private but maybe thats a gain because those are the only guys who
should be in this game  it certainly makes it difficult to sustain the credit rating agency or industry
mr gibson  we have kind of a dual problem in that we want investors to do a better job
of evaluating the risks and maybe better ratings would help on that  at the same time the existing
rating agencies did a bad job so we have to criticize them  we have to find some way to reconcile
those
chairman bernanke  i have president evans for a twohander and then president
lockhart and president lacker  i also see that president plosser has a twohander and i think at that
point we should probably go onto the last presentation
mr plosser  i can pass if it gets too long  thats okay
chairman bernanke  okay  all right  so president evans president lockhart and
president lacker
mr evans  i had an elementary question that governor kroszners question kicked off
the background briefing was very well written and very clear which made me think that i
understood things and i probably dont  but you used the term get a rating and at other times
you talk about it as if its a sufficient statistic and how the agencies were warned that its not a
sufficient statistic  there are transition matrices to downgrade and yet they violated that
themselves because you said that for the abs they thought of it as a sufficient statistic themselves
is a lot of this inherently a multidimensional risk model thats required for some of these structured
finance vehicles whereas for the corporates its closer to a single dimensional risk model
mr gibson  yes
mr evans  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  id like to ask as a practical matter what weighting we should put in our
expectations or even our recommendations on reform of the rating system versus the expectation
that investors would actually reduce their reliance on ratings  my impression is that many
institutional investors especially public pension funds are notoriously understaffed  then they
work for as you pointed out in your presentation boards that either represent the beneficiaries or in
some respects are quite political in nature and not necessarily financially sophisticated  that would
lead me to the conclusion that as a practical matter theyre going to be highly reliant on ratings
the ratio of professional employees to the volume of investment is so low that they have to choose
their restaurants by stars because they dont have time to do the tasting themselves or theyre not
given the budgets to do that now  so im curious about this tension between getting the rating
system right versus having the investors reduce their reliance on ratings
ms hirtle  well i think youve identified the key problem that many of these funds
face and the important entities in many ways are these investment consultants  at least the funds
we looked at all hire one or more of these investment consultants  many of them are from large
globally active firms and the role that those consultants play is precisely to address the issues that
youve raised  they help them select the asset manager who is doing the investing  they help them
design the mandates or instructions  they help them monitor what the asset managers are doing and
assess their performance  so to some extent those consultants are a kind of sweet spot for these
funds in terms of where the additional layer of sophistication that doesnt run just off the rating
could come from
mr lockhart  but is your impression that those supplemental parties the consultants
and the asset managers themselves have the credit analysis and valuation capability to address
sophisticated structured products
ms hirtle  we didnt do an evaluation of them but some of them are from very very
large firms  they are advising funds in the trillions of dollars across all their different clients  that
is the service they are selling and so they should bethey had better bein a position to do that
mr fisher  may i just suggest that you reexamine that proposition  they usually
evaluate performance principally after going through initial screening devices  they almost never
that im aware of provide the kind of analysis that youre assuming  so i would reexamine that
proposition
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  my memory of finance 101 is that you dont buy longterm risky assets
funded by short debt without sufficient compensation  so the neglected aspect of the whole episode
we went through was how people would have been compensated in other circumstances but thats a
different discussion  i think these recommendations make sense and confirmation of that is that the
market is moving in that direction anyway  i dont know how many of these recommendations
were put forward by those market participants you cited who two years ago were not trusting these
ratingsi think thats a key question  but the broader thing here is that the world of finance now is
a world of competing econometric analysis and were never going to rate the model risk if you ask
the question what would you expect the behavior of a market like that to display  youd expect
occasional big misses from erring assumptions  youd expect those misses to be corrected by
people reflecting and improving practices going forward  a sort of schumpeterian process in this is
going to generate model risk and big model misses and so i think its being careful to keep track of
whether the insights weve gleaned are hindsight or should have been known ahead of time
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  why dont we continue with the final
portion
mr greenlee  thank you  to support the financial stability forums working group on market and institutional resilience as noted in the top panel of exhibit 8 supervisors from france germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states formed the senior supervisors group in late october  participating
us supervisors included the occ and sec as well as the federal reserve  the groups goal was to develop a common understanding through a series of interviews with selected firms of how the riskmanagement systems of core financial institutions performed during the financial market turbulence  the top right panel of exhibit 8 shows the 11 banking firms that supervisors interviewed  this effort was not a complete review of all firms and events  for example we did not meet with bear stearns or morgan stanley as part of this effort  rather it was designed to inform supervisory authorities about the general effectiveness of risk management at global financial institutions  the supervisors have prepared a paper detailing their findings which will be conveyed to the fsf and released publicly  the bottom panel lists some observations about the firms overall performance  most large financial services firms while affected by market developments generally avoided significant losses  although most firms riskmanagement processes worked as intended there were some definite outliers  some firms recognized the emerging additional risks and took deliberate actions to limit or mitigate them  others recognized the additional risks but accepted them  still other firms did not fully recognize the risks in time to mitigate them adequately  moreover the riskmanagement practices varied by firm and by strategy as did the range of outcomes to date  i should note that the primary riskmanagement weaknesses observed here are not new  they have been observed  in past episodes and are thoroughly discussed in existing riskmanagement literature and supervisory guidance
as noted in the top panel of exhibit 9 the senior supervisors group identified four primary factors that differentiated the organizations that suffered larger losses from those that did not 1 the effectiveness of senior management oversight of balance sheet liquidity and capital positions 2 the effectiveness of communications among senior management business lines and riskmanagement functions 3 the sophistication diversity and adaptability of risk measures utilized and 4 the attention devoted to valuation issues  with respect to senior management oversight as indicated in the bottom panel of exhibit 9 the more effective firms were more disciplined in measuring and limiting these risks in advance of the crisis and proved to be more agile in reducing exposures or hedging when the crisis occurred  these firms focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity positions throughout the entire organization  senior management of these organizations had established adequate capital and liquidity buffers that could sustain the firm through a period without access to the market for funding  they have created and effectively enforced internal pricing mechanisms capital allocation methodologies and limits that provided effective incentives for individual business line managers to control activities that might otherwise lead to significant balance sheet growth or contingent liquidity demands  conversely the less effective firms were not as focused on the overall strength of their balance sheet across all legal entities and thus operated with more limited liquidity and capital buffers  these
organizations had weaker controls over their balance sheets and were more focused on earnings growth or defense of a market leadership position  these firms did not have limit structures that were consistently or effectively enforced which allowed business lines to grow balance sheet exposures rapidly and increase contingent liquidity exposures  they did not properly aggregate or monitor offbalancesheet exposures across the organization including the exposure to contingency backup lines of credit to abcp programs and generally did not have in place effective financial controls including capital allocation processes commensurate with the business strategy
the top panel of exhibit 10 provides additional detail on the importance of effective communications among senior management business lines and risk management functions  the more effective firms emphasized a comprehensive firmwide consolidated assessment of risk  senior managers of these organizations were actively engaged and had in place a disciplined culture and wellestablished processes for routine discussion of current and emerging risks across the business lines risk management and the corporate treasury function  senior managers at these organizations collectively made decisions about the firms overall risk appetite exposures and risk mitigation strategies rather than relying solely on the judgment of business lines  they were able to effectively leverage the assessment of risks from one business line to consider how subprime exposures for example might affect other businesses  as a result the more effective firms had a more timely and well informed perspective on how market developments could unfold  in some cases senior management had almost a year to evaluate the magnitude of the emerging risks from subprime mortgages on its various business lines  this in turn enabled them to implement plans for reducing their exposures while it was still practical and more  cost effective to do so  conversely less effective firms were siloed did not effectively share information across business lines on emerging risks and were comparatively slower in taking actions to mitigate exposures as each business line had to assess and consider emerging risks on their own without the benefit of views  or actions taken by other business line managers
with regard to the risk measures utilized as shown in the bottom panel the more effective firms used a wide range of risk measures and analytical tools to discuss and challenge views on credit and market risk broadly across different business lines within the firm in a disciplined fashion  these firms have thought more thoroughly about the interplay of their risk measures than the other firms and used a combination of different risk measures and scenario analysis to understand risk exposures  it also appears that the more effective firms had committed more resources to risk management and management information systems  as a result they had more timely and scalable management information systems and in large part did not have to create new management reports to understand risks and exposures  conversely the less effective firms were too dependent on a single quantitative risk measure and they did not utilize scenario analysis in their decisionmaking and tended to apply a mechanical riskmanagement approach  management information systems also
were not as scalable and there was a need to develop a number of ad hoc reports to help senior management understand the risks and exposures of the company
the top panel of exhibit 11 elaborates on the fourth factor that proved critical which is the attention devoted to valuation issues  the more effective organizations were more disciplined in how they valued the holdings of complex or potentially illiquid securities  they employed moresophisticated valuation practices and had invested in the development of pricing models and staff with specialized expertise these organizations were skeptical of and less reliant on external ratings and emphasized marktomarket discipline in their businesses in ways that others did not less effective organizations in some cases did not have key valuation models in place prior to the market disruption relied heavily on thirdparty views of risk and tended to have a narrower view of the risks associated with their cdo business as mainly being credit risk and did not actively seek market valuation information  the bottom panel explains how supervisors are planning to address the specific deficiencies  as i mentioned earlier in my presentation the riskmanagement deficiencies identified during this exercise are not new and existing supervisory guidance addresses these issues  therefore supervisory efforts will include addressing riskmanagement deficiencies at each company through the supervisory process and reemphasizing the importance of strong independent risk management through a series of speeches industry outreach and possible reissuance of existing guidance  in addition supervisors plan to complete the work already under way within the basel committee on bank supervision to update liquidity risk management guidance to strengthen industry practices  a review of existing federal reserve guidance on market and liquidity risk management is under way to ensure that it effectively outlines the need for banks to use a number of tools to include multiple ways of viewing quantitative and qualitative risk analysis including var stress tests and scenario analysis
finally supervisors plan to develop on an interagency basis guidance related to the management of the originatetodistribute model to ensure that banking organizations effectively manage the credit market and operational risks of this activity  i will now turn it over to art angulo to discuss related regulatory policies

mr angulo  the top panel of exhibit 12 sets forth the question we sought to addressnamely to what extent did regulatory incentives contribute to or fail to mitigate weaknesses exposed by the recent turmoil  in doing so we defined the term regulatory incentives to encompass both regulatory capital and financial reporting requirements  in addition we distinguished between policies that may have mattered for the buildup to the market turmoil and those that have made managing the turmoil more challenging  our conclusions are summarized in the middle panel  not surprisingly incentives to minimize regulatory capital are a much more important driver of bank behavior than financial reporting incentives  moreover the current regulatory capital framework is not neutral as to how banks structure risk positions both the leverage ratio and the basel i riskbased capital framework have encouraged banks to securitize lowrisk assets and importantly to support securitizations of higherrisk assets through instruments with low mandated capital charges such as 364day liquidity facilities  financial reporting incentives were not critical to banks
decisions although certain financial reporting issuesparticularly disclosure practiceshave been a factor in how the turmoil has been unfolding
before i turn to specific recommendations it is important to emphasize that improvements were already in train even before the market difficulties emerged last summer  most significantly the basel 2 advanced approaches and related improvements greatly enhance the risk sensitivity of the regulatory capital framework and create incentives for better risk management  in the bottom panel are three examples relevant to the issues we have been discussing this morning  first capital charges for most unused shortterm credit and liquidity facilities have been increased to more adequately reflect the risk exposure  second new standards for banks to hold capital against the default risk of complex less liquid credit products in the trading book are being finalized as the basel committee is currently seeking public comment on principles for calculating a socalled incremental default risk charge against such products  i should note that the work to develop the incremental default risk principles was done by a joint basel committeeiosco working group cochaired  by norah barger  third the securitization framework in basel 2 which builds on previous unilateral us enhancements establishes a more risksensitive capital treatment for securitization exposuresit bases capital charges on estimates of underlying risk rather than on an exposures legal form
i will now turn to recommendations in exhibit 13 beginning first in the top panel with those related to regulatory capital  first notwithstanding the improvements brought about by basel 2 there is scope for reassessing the treatment of securitizations involving abs cdos  the risk weights and resulting capital charges for these resecuritizations were calibrated under the assumption that loss correlations within a pool of securitized assets would be no greater than those exhibited by cdos backed by traditional corporate bonds  it is now apparent that the actual loss correlations within such resecuritizationsespecially for the most highly rated tranchesmay be much higher  at its december 2007 meeting the basel committee agreed to take up this issue
the second recommendation addresses the issue of reputational risk  there have been several occasions over the last 6 months in which banks have elected to purchase assets from or extend credit to offbalancesheet vehicles they had organized and money market and other investment funds they managed even though they were not contractually obligated to do so  whether a bank management will provide support in excess of its contractual obligations is a business decision  thus it is not practical to attempt to design an explicit capital charge for reputational risk
instead supervisors should exercise supervisory oversight to ensure that banks sufficiently consider reputational risk and its implications for capital and liquidity buffers
the third and fourth recommendations deal with the issue of the procyclicality of capital regulations  the existence of fixed capital requirements as well as rating agency expectations for capital ratios discourages banks from drawing on their
capital cushions in times of stress  it is therefore very difficult to devise changes in capital regulations that would allow capital to function more effectively as a shock absorber without compromising safety and soundness objectives  nonetheless these last two recommendations are aimed at mitigating the potential procyclical effects of a more risksensitive capital framework  the third recommendation is based on elements of the basel 2 framework that were designed to allow supervisors to address both safety and soundness and procyclicality concerns  the advanced internal ratings based approach of basel 2 requires that banks lossgivendefault estimates reflect economic downturn conditions and that stress tests of their advanced systems include consideration of how economic cycles affect riskbased capital requirements
rigorous supervisory evaluation of these two elements can help ensure that
1 regulatory capital embeds forwardlooking forecasts of recovery rates and
2 banks manage their regulatory capital positions in a manner that enables them to accommodate variations in the amount of minimum required capital over an economic cycle  the fourth recommendation is to explore ways to encourage inclusion in the regulatory capital base of debt instruments that mandatorily convert into equity when a banking organization is under stress  the automatic conversion of debt instruments into equity under such circumstances is appealing from a supervisory perspective as well as from a broader macroeconomic policy perspective this concept has not yet been examined in depth by the staff but we believe it merits further study including an assessment of the past experiences of banks with such instruments to determine its feasibility
lets now move to the recommendations in the bottom panel  these deal with improving disclosure practices which can help to reduce the uncertainty that has been a key feature of the recent turmoil  first financial institutionsespecially those in the united statesimproved their disclosures about subprimerelated exposures as the turmoil wore on  nonetheless supervisors and regulators should continue to push market participants to make timely and detailed disclosures about the size and composition of subprimerelated exposures  the second and third recommendations focus on disclosures related to assetbacked commercial paper programs  in view of the potential exposure associated with reputational risk market participants appear to desire additional details about banks dealings with abcp programs  disclosing information about the distribution of assets underlying such programs by type industry and credit rating would bring the disclosures on par with those provided for onbalancesheet assets  similarly in view of the extent to which investors in asset backed commercial paper have retreated from rolling over or purchasing paper that they suspect may be supported by subprimerelated assets banks and asset managers that sponsor abcp conduits should improve disclosures to investors particularly for conduits other than the traditional multiseller programs  that completes our prepared remarks  we would be pleased to take your questions at this time
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions  president rosengren
mr rosengren  it is great to see some bank supervision people at this table and i
would just highlight one of the comments that you made about silos  it is interesting that this
morning we have been discussing issues of bank balance sheet constraints and how that would
occur and it might be useful to think structurally within our own organization whether there are
ways to do a better job of getting people in bank supervision to understand some of the financial
stability issues we think about and then vice versa  maybe having some bank supervision people
come to fomc meetings might be one way to actually promote some of this
in terms of the things that you were talking about another issue that i think has been
important is that weve been talking about the effect of dropping housing prices  i know a
horizontal stress review was done about a year ago and im sure brian or jon remembers that the
large financial institutions did the stress testing  when they did that stress testing what was striking
was that there were four institutionsi think it was citigroup jpmorgan chase wachovia and
bank of americain that stress test and all four concluded that a housingprice reduction of
between 10 percent and 20 percent would affect earnings but wouldnt affect capital  obviously in
retrospect that doesnt seem to have been a good forecast  one since we do think that stress testing
is useful maybe understanding that and going back to those same four institutions and
understanding their stress testing might be a useful exercise to do  two if you did that exercise
wed learn something about how theyre thinking about housing prices and the indirect effects that
might occur because one of our concerns around the fomc table is that there may be unintended
consequences if housing prices drop more than they have historically  just as the banks have to
think about those kinds of stress tests and what they have already learned from the fact that they
didnt pick up some of the indirect effects our own knowledge would be supplemented if we
thought about some of those indirect effects as well
so the horizontal stress testing was interesting in that i think some of those institutions are
on the good side and the bad side of your things  the horizontal stress testing isnt what generated
the decisionsand i do agree with your conclusion that most of the decisions were made by senior
management  some organizations didnt do subprime mortgages at all  im not so sure it was
generated from the stress testing as much as a gut feeling by senior bank management that they
werent going to engage in subprime mortgages  i think thats true for a lot of these activities  its
interesting whos at the top of the list and whos at the bottom of the list for a lot of these activities
ideally over time both bank supervision and bank risk management would get to the point that its
not just a gut decision by a person at the top but is a little more systematic and that the risk
management process does that  are you thinking of ways that we could actually encourage that
kind of interaction so that it becomes less gut from senior management and more integrated into the
risk management  i know that was kind of a long entry
mr angulo  well i would just comment on the first point that you made in terms of
silos  i guess we would fully agree were having a great time here so we would love to see more
interaction between supervision and the fomc
vice chairman geithner  be careful what you wish for
mr angulo  you know when people debate whether to have supervision with a central
bank or not one of the key arguments is that only we can bring to bear the resources of the entire
central bank and also provide input from the supervision side  so clearly thats something i think
we need to do more of  in terms of the second question do you want to take a fresh crack at that
brian
mr peters  yes  my perception is that the people who were further down on the list
made active decisions to get out of the business or reduce their scale of the business not necessarily
just on gut feeling but because they had invested earlier on in the staff and the models to evaluate
the product space  so they understood that the economics of the subprime business had deteriorated
and that the risk relative to the return was rising and they made an active decision usually to
retract a bit from that space  now they may have made those decisions gradually and incrementally
over the year from mid2006 forward  it wasnt one stress test but it was a thorough understanding
of the economics of the actual business that drove their decisionmaking
mr angulo  i would also agree that your general point about banks being more
exacting in their stress testing is a good one because its something we and other supervisors to be
honest with you continually look at and many times the response that banks get internally from
either owners or managers or through supervisors is that well if its too extreme its not really
plausible and you cant really act on it  the other argument you sometimes hear is well it costs a
lot of money to integrate that across the firm and do it the right way and thats a tough sell  so i
agree with your point that we need to do more and then push harder on stress testing  the way that
you suggest is kind of novel  you do a back test and show it to them  thats an interesting concept
mr greenlee  i might add one thing to that  in interviews we did with some firms one
point that they made was that stress testing was informative and important but a next step theyre
trying to take is what it would take to cause that stress event to happen for different types of assets
so they are trying to anticipatenot so much that they just assume a 10 percent drop but how they
would get to a 10 percent drop  what would be the events that would cause that to happen  then
they think that through in a more systematic way  i know some companies have learned what their
highly rated things are that are viewed as stablevalue assets elsewhere on their balance sheets and
are thinking about how those could start to unwind or to deteriorate
mr peters  we need to be careful with the nomenclature  stress testing right now in the
industry encompasses a lot of things and people will tell you that they do stress testing but they are
really doing static shocks  what we are talking about is not a historical analysis but a kind of
forwardlooking scenario that builds in your view of the world  those are the firms that again
made moreactive decisions to reduce their exposures
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  i think this was very interesting and i have a suggestion and then a
question  the suggestion is that this morning we had the federal open market committee meeting
this afternoon we should have the federal market oversight committee meeting and that is what
were doing right now in looking at some of these institutions  my question is as you look at these
and you compare the most effective and least effective are you in the process and shouldnt we be
in the processbecause we go back and look at these horizontal reviewsof looking at what
lessons weve learned about moreeffective institutions and lesseffective institutions during the
horizontal review so that we can be more proactive in terms of the outcomes that were now seeing
if we do that in a systematic fashion over time we could anticipate not allwe learned a long time
ago that you cannot anticipate it allbut some of these differences and put more pressure on some
institutions that were not doing good risk analysis to step up to it before it becomes a crisis  i dont
know if were doing lessons learned for ourselves in that regard
mr peters  i would say weve looked at a lot of that  the one place i would highlight
most articulately is the degree of international coordination and cooperation weve had under way
the core firms in the united states are one portion of this system now with a number of very
significant global competitors  so the coordination between us the occ the sec the uk fsa
and the other senior supervisor groups has been really necessary for everyone to get a good
understanding of practices  its perhaps more valuable to some of the foreign supervisors who have
only one or two large firms under their jurisdictions  but even from our vantage point of what our
direct supervisory responsibility is the consolidation within the industry has collapsed the number
of firms that we view directly
mr greenlee  i might add that we are trying to look at this  its not just an issue of
guidance but we are going back through the supervisory process in terms of what weve learned
through these interviews and challenging our beliefs and prior assessments
mr hoenig  i think that is good because if you think about it we have the basel capital
standards coming forward which involve the advanced methodrelying on those institutions to a
great degree in terms of judging their capital and their capital levels  when they are under pressure
they will tend to work the model  it is natural  as we have said before the incentives are that they
will work the model  so if we are not taking lessons learned from this in terms of anticipating those
behaviors i think we will repeat history in the surprises that we get
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  just very quickly you did a terrific job  i think its
important though to recognize that this isnt done yet and were not going to know fundamentally
how we feel about the relative strengths and weaknesses in the system until we see how this plays
out  dont let these initial presumptionseither the diagnosis or the prescription particularly your
list of prescriptionsharden too much because there are some judgments that were just not going
to be able to make until the dust settles and we have a little time for reflection in that context  i
think a lot of damage has been done to the credibility of our financial system  its not clear how
much damage because we dont know how this is going to play out  but damage has been done
and we are going to bear a lot of the burden of figuring out how to craft a compelling policy
response recognizing of course that regulation may be part of the problem and wont necessarily be
part of the solution  anyway mostly i just meant to compliment you  you did a great job and i
think its helpful really to have this much work done early on in getting us to the point where we
know what were going to do to the system to make it less vulnerable to this in the future  even as
we manage the crisis i think its good to have made that investment and a good tribute to the
strength of the system that we were able to devote these quality resources even though weve all
been busy managing the storm
chairman bernanke  let me also thank the staff for an excellent presentation  this
is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work thats being done on all these different topics and
in turn were collaborating with our colleagues here in the united states and abroad and i guess
well keep working and hope to find some valuable lessons out of this experience
ive been asked to remind people that you have until tomorrow close of business if you wish
to revise your projections  brian madigan raised a few questions about consistency  if you want to
think about that of course feel free to do so  our next meeting is march 18  i look forward to
seeing you then and theres a lunch available for those of you who can stay  thank you very much
the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
