transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on october 2829 2008
october 28 2008afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  we received requests from
members for more time at this meeting to discuss the economic situation and our policy
response  so as you know we postponed the special presentations on inflationmy apologies to
the presenters  we will come back to that at the appropriate time
what we are going to do instead is to have three rounds of briefings today and tomorrow
we are going to start in the first round with bill dudley and his usual presentation on open
market operations followed by nathan sheets on the swaps proposals that you have been
informed about and then bill bassett will give a supplementary briefing on financial markets to
complete that round  then well have qa at that point  we will then turn to the economic
situation and hear from norm morin on the nonfinancial economy and linda kole on the
international economy and from brian madigan on our projections  then we will have another
round of questions  tomorrow at lunch after the close of the formal meeting we will have some
additional briefings on the tarp troubled asset relief program on the fdic program and on
the supervisory and regulatory implications of that  so we hope to make this a very informative
two days and we hope to have plenty of interaction and conversation about our broad policy
response to these very difficult times  so let me start then by turning to bill dudley  bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  today my attention will be narrower than usual given the briefings by bill bassett and linda kole that will follow covering the broader developments in the equity fixed income and foreign exchange markets in the united states and abroad which have been considerable  over the past six weeks  i will focus on three topics  1 the impact of our new facilities and other government initiatives on market function 2 the consequences of the expansion of these facilities on our balance sheet and our ability to hit the federal funds rate target over time and 3 the travails of the hedge fund community and how

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
this could potentially add to market dysfunction  i will be referring to the chart package that should be in front of you
as you all know the lehman bankruptcy led to sharp outflows from prime money market mutual funds into treasuryonly funds exhibit 1  the result was a collapse in treasury bill yields exhibit 2  at the same time the cost of financing treasury securities via repo fell sharplythis is illustrated in exhibit 3 by the drop in the overnight general collateral gc repo rate  this increased the incentive for treasury traders to short treasury securities that were already hard to obtain because the effective cost of borrowing such securities is determined by the level of the gc repo rate  as a result treasury fails which represent treasury securities that are not delivered as promised to their buyers soared  treasury fails were also exacerbated  by the withdrawal from the securities lending market of some large holders of treasuries including some major foreign central banks  although treasury yields fell sharply and treasury bills were in great demand the rise in fails resulted in a sharp diminution of trading and liquidity in the treasury securities market  the fact that there are severe marketfunctioning problems in the asset class that is in greatest demandtreasuriesunderscores the scope and severity of the markets broader dysfunction
at the same time the outflows from prime money market funds led to a sharp drop in the demand for commercial paper a significant rise in commercial paper rates and a shortening of commercial paper maturities exhibits 4 and 5  term bank funding spreads rose sharply with the onemonth and threemonth liborois spreads increasing to levels that make the earlier peaks look like modest speed bumps exhibits 6 and 7  the lehman bankruptcy caused counterparty risk concerns to intensify  moreover the lehman bankruptcy disrupted a number of markets because participants in these markets were uncertain how to adjust their long and short position exposures that offset their open positions with lehman  the result was a sharp drop in the willingness of counterparties to engage with one another especially at term  essentially the result was a massive coordination problem that has led to a very unattractive equilibrium  i would put it this way  i wont lend to you even though i think youre okay because i am not sure others will lend to you either  i need some assurance that others will lend to you in order to have some assurance i can get my money back if i need it  even though it has been in the interest of all parties to engage no party has been willing to go first
in response the federal reserve dramatically expanded its programs of liquidity support  the size of each taf auction has been raised to 150 billionthe same size as the entire taf program just six weeks ago  fixedrate tender dollar auctions were implemented by the boe the boj the ecb and the snb  the assetbacked commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility amlf and the commercial paper funding facility cpff were implemented and plans for a money market investor funding facility mmiff were announced  the federal reserve and other central banks stepped forward to engage in transactions with a broad range of bank and in the case of the fed nonbank counterparties  the hope of course is that
this willingness to engage will reduce rollover risk and therefore encourage others to reengage with their counterparties
at least for now the escalation in the size of the taf auctions appears to have been sufficient to satisfy the demand for dollar funds in the united states  as shown in exhibit 8 the first two auctions of 150 billion have been slightly undersubscribed currently about 300 billion of taf credit is outstanding  demand for dollar funding in europe has increased sharply even though the cost is much higher than in our taf auctions  whereas the two most recent taf auctions were stopped out at the ois rate which is the minimum bid rate the foreign fixedrate tender operations have been conducted at a rate of ois plus 100 basis points  as shown in exhibits 9 and 10 swap outstandings have grown to nearly 500 billion currently  the ecb swap size is currently about 280 billion more than half the total amount of swaps outstanding  the amount of outstanding swaps is likely to climb sharply when the first 84day fixedrate tender operations are conducted in europe next week
the cpff facility is another important element in the feds program of liquidity escalation  as you know this facility provides a backstop for domestic issuers of a1p1rated commercial paper  issuers can sell commercial paper to the facility at threemonth term for an effective cost of ois plus 200 basis points for nonfinancial and financial issuers and ois plus 300 basis points for assetbacked commercial paper abcp  this facility complements the amlf which lends funds to banks at the primary credit facility rate against the abcp purchased from money market mutual funds  yesterday was the first day that the cpff was open for business and a number of borrowers issued commercial paper to the facility totaling more than
50 billion  at the close of business last week 79 issuers had registered to use the facility paying 10 basis points or 580 million to cover the potential issuance of commercial paper  the 10 basis point fee provides a little equity to get the program off and running
finally the most recent facility the money market investor funding facility was announced last week  this facility will provide liquidity to five conduits that will purchase commercial paper and certificates of deposit of designated issuers from 2a7 money market mutual funds  it will likely be several more weeks before this facility is operational
the escalation in the provision of liquidity and some of the other initiatives i will discuss shortly have led to a grudging improvement in the interbank funding markets and in the commercial paper market  reviewing the earlier exhibits most term funding spreads have narrowed but the improvement is modest relative to the earlier deterioration  it is unclear at this stage whether the modest extent of improvement reflects the limited ability of additional capacity and breadth in terms of liquidity provision to restore confidence especially at a time that the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated globally or whether it will just take time for these liquidity facilities to restore confidence and some semblance of normality to the money markets
the expansion of the feds liquidity provisions has been accompanied by escalations on two other fronts  first the fdic announced a bank funding guarantee program  although the terms and conditions of this program have not yet been finalized the program is likely to guarantee most of the new senior debt obligations of participating depository institutions and their associated holding companies up to a cap of 125 percent of the maturing obligations through june 30 2009  importantly new interbank funding will be covered  how this affects the federal funds market remains to be seen  second the treasury has committed 250 billion of funds from the tarp program to inject as preferred stock into the banking system  nine large banks announced two weeks ago that they will accept 125 billion of preferred stock investment from the treasury  over the past few days the treasury announced that an additional 35 billion of capital has been committed  the fdic guarantee announcement and the tarp capital infusion have been effective in shoring up confidence in the major us banks  as shown in exhibits 11 and 12 credit default swap spreads for most major us financial institutions have narrowed sharply
but the guarantee of the senior debt of depository institutions and their associated holding companies has generated some unintended consequences for those firms not covered by these guarantees  in particular the credit default swap spreads for major nonbank financials have narrowed less than those for the banks exhibit 13
moreover the funding costs for the gses have climbed especially for shortterm discount note issuance  the funding costs for fannie and freddie for both longterm and shortterm debt are shown in exhibits 14 15 and 16  however the fear that funds would flow out of prime money market funds back into bank assets guaranteed by the fdic has not been realizedat least not yet
the expansion of the feds facilities and the openended nature of the fixedrate tender dollar operations by the foreign central banks that we are funding by swaps have led to rapid expansion of our balance sheet  exhibit 17 provides a snapshot of the federal reserves balance sheet at different times before and during the crisis during the first 13 months the size of our balance sheet was little changed  we accommodated our liquidity programs mainly by selling treasury securities  during the next stage which began around the time of the lehman bankruptcy filing we expanded our balance sheet but drained the reserve additions primarily by having the treasury issue supplemental financing program bills and placing the proceeds on our balance sheet  however the capacity to continue to drain reserves via sfp bills was unlikely to be a longterm solution because the treasury would ultimately be constrained by the debt limit ceiling
the passage of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 granted the federal reserve the authority to pay interest on reserves immediately  this was very important because it meant that we could expand our balance sheet size by unsterilized reserve additions but at the same time keep the federal funds rate from crashing to zero by paying a positive interest rate on holdings of excess reserves
further rapid balance sheet expansion appears inevitable as the takedown from the taf auctions and the fixedrate tenders expands further and as our new facilities
such as the cpff and mmiff begin operation  although the estimates shown for yearend in exhibit 17 are indicativethe actual size will be driven by the use of our various liquidity facilitiesit does seem likely that the federal reserve systems balance sheet will grow very rapidly through yearend  we are now nearly three weeks into the new interestonreserves regime which was implemented on
october 9  as you know the board of governors initially set the spread between the target federal funds rate and the rate paid on excess reserves at 75 basis points
policymakers erred on the size of a wide margin given unsettled market conditions and the lack of experience with the new regime recognizing that the spread could be reduced if the federal funds rate traded soft relative to the target
as shown in exhibit 18 despite the payment of interest on reserves the federal funds rate has continued to trade soft relative to the target  as a result the board narrowed the spread to 35 basis points with the start last thursday of the second reserve maintenance period under the interestonreserves regime  it is too soon to assess the effect of the narrower spread on our ability to push the federal funds rate back up to the target because the interest rate paid on reserves is based upon the lowest target federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period  so currently it is hard to separate the impact of the narrower spread on the effective federal funds rate from the expectations for further cuts in the target federal funds rate that might occur at this meeting  there are two complications in fixing the interestonreserves spread at a level consistent with the target  first some of the gses which hold balances at the fed are not allowed to earn interest on their balances  thus they have to sell federal funds to banks that in turn hold the funds and are paid the intereston reserves rate  second some banks have also been selling federal funds below the interestonreserves rate  we expect this to diminish over time as they gain more experience with the new regime  however other factors such as concern with their overall leverage ratios could cause this phenomenon to persist  as a result there has been a significant amount of federal funds rate trading below the interestonreserves rate  this is illustrated in exhibit 19 in which the circles are sized to reflect the amount of trading at a particular rate level
this trading of fed funds below the interestonreserves rate has two consequences  first it blurs the meaning of the effective federal funds rate with respect to its relationship to the stance of monetary policy  conceptually the interest onreserves rate rather than the effective federal funds rate could be viewed as representing the default riskfree investment rate for banks  second it implies that we may have to narrow considerably further the spread between the target federal funds rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves in order to push the effective federal funds rate up to the target  in principle if fed funds sales were to continue in large volume below the interestonreserves rate the interestonreserves rate might need to be set right at the federal funds rate target in order to support the federal funds rate close to that level
before turning to a discussion of monetary policy and inflation expectations i want to make a few comments about the hedge fund industry  before this crisis
began most of the fears about a market meltdown were focused on hedge funds until now these fears have been mostly misplaced  however the risks that hedge fund problems will now exacerbate the crisis have increased substantially recently the underlying problem is that the recent performance of the hedge fund industry has been very poor and hedge fund viability is not very robust when net asset values slip considerably below their highwater marks in individual funds  september was the poorest month in the past 10 years and so far october returns are on pace to be even worse  net asset value for the entire hedge fund industry is down more than
10 percent yeartodate  the average performance shown in exhibit 20 masks substantial dispersion in returns and particularly poor performance for certain strategies  in particular convertible arbitrage emerging market arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage strategies suffered doubledigit losses in the month of september and further losses are likely in october
poor hedge fund performance has been exacerbated by several factors  first policy shifts such as the short sales ban have caused big problems for convertible arbitrage statistical arbitrage and longshort equity strategies  this has been an important factor behind citadels travails  second prime brokers continue to pull back in their willingness to provide financing by raising their haircuts assessed against hedge fund assets as market volatility rises exhibit 21  third investors are pulling funds out of hedge funds because of their poor performance and a generalized increase in risk aversion  as a result hedge funds are raising cash to meet actual and potential redemptions and many hedge funds are either hitting or approaching their net asset value trigger points
let me say a few words about net asset value triggers  hedge funds often negotiate agreements with each of their prime brokers that set the terms for their access to financing  these contracts give the prime brokers the option to seize and liquidate collateral if the hedge fund net asset value falls by more than a certain magnitudesay a 30 percent decline in assets under management over a threemonth period thats a very common trigger  obviously if only a few hedge funds are close to these triggers there is little problem as there is no potential flood of asset sales into the market  but when so many hedge funds are under pressure at the same time the risk of broader asset liquidation increases  the prime broker may have a lessened incentive to waive its right to liquidate collateral when a greater proportion of the industry is troubled because the firstmover advantage of selling collateral likely becomes more important under such circumstances
i anticipate that the pressure from the liquidation of hedge fund assets will continue to weigh on financial markets over the next few months  some major fund of fund managers anticipate redemptions between now and early 2009 of at least
25 percent of the total industry or about 500 billion based upon the estimated
2 trillion size of the global hedge fund business
market participants continue to price in additional cuts in the federal funds rate target  of course it is a little harder than usual to tell what they are expecting based
on futures prices because the federal funds rate has traded soft relative to the target and those expectations are also embedded in the nearterm rates for fed funds futures contracts  regardless of the cause if you look at exhibits 22 and 23 there has been a fairly sharp downward shift in the federal funds rate curve and the eurodollar futures curvethey have shifted downward about 100 basis points  moreover the curves are considerably flatter than they were a few months ago indicating that market participants expect that the fomc will be slow to raise the federal funds target in 2009  our primary dealer survey indicates that most survey respondents expect the committee to lower the target federal funds rate over the next two meetings to around 1 percent and keep it there through most of 2009  this also represents a downward shift of about 100 basis points from the survey conducted before the september 16 meeting exhibits 24 and 25  when the survey was conducted more than a week ago the majority of respondents anticipated a 25 basis point cut  since then the consensus has flipped with most now anticipating a 50 basis point rate cut at this meeting
on the inflation expectations front normal relationships between tips and nominal treasuries have been distorted by the illiquidity of tips relative to nominal treasuries and the high level of chronic fails in the fiveyear sector of the nominal treasury market  as a result tips yields have climbed sharply relatively to nominal treasuries leading to a sharp fall in breakeven inflation measures exhibit 26  the fact that breakeven inflation rates have fallen more sharply in the fiveyear sector than in the tenyear sector has generated a rise in fiveyear fiveyearforward measures of inflation exhibit 27  the distortions in the us treasury market suggest considerable caution in interpreting the rise in these measures  interestingly our desk survey of primary dealers shows a slight drop in longterm inflation expectations since the september survey exhibit 28
before concluding let me note that the staff recommends approval of a
15 billion foreign exchange swap line with the reserve bank of new zealand to help satisfy the dollar funding needs of banks that operate in new zealand  as noted in the memo to the committee from nathan sheets and myself that was distributed on friday this would complement the swap agreements that we have already enacted with other advanced economies and would have the same technical features as those with the smaller advanced countries that is australia denmark norway and sweden with fixed swap line limits  nathan will be discussing the potential for additional swap line authorizations for four emerging market countries recommended by the staff that were discussed in a second memo to the committee on friday
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations of the system open market account that have been undertaken since the september 16 fomc meeting  nathan will continue our presentation
chairman bernanke  thank you bill  nathan
mr sheets  in response to intensified global financial stresses the central banks of four major emerging market economiesmexico brazil korea and singaporehave recently expressed interest in temporary liquidity swap lines with the federal reserve  for the reasons outlined in our background memo which was circulated on friday the staff recommends that the committee approve these requests  we propose that the lines be sized at 30 billion for each of these four countries similar to our existing lines with canada sweden and australia  we envision that these lines would expire on april 30 2009 as is the case with our other swap lines
we also recommend that these lines have several safeguards relative to our lines with central banks in the advanced economies  notably even following initial fomc approval the proposed lines could not be drawn on without further authorization and individual drawings would be limited to 5 billion  we recommend that the fomc delegate to its foreign currency subcommittee the authority to approve these drawings  the subcommittee would ensure that the dollars drawn would be used in a manner consistent with the purposes of the swap agreement  the central banks in these countries would also agree to publicly announce the fact that they had drawn on their lines and the mechanisms that they had used to allocate the dollar liquidity  these safeguards are designed to provide protections for federal reserve resources and to ensure that the swap lines are used in a manner consistent with our envisioned objectives  these safeguards however are not intended to be so onerous as to discourage the use of the lines if the situation warrants
we see the case for these swap lines as resting on three important observations first each of these economies has significant economic and financial mass  mexico brazil and korea are all large economies with gdp of around 1 trillion and singapore is a major financial center  given the structural interconnectedness of the global economy and the financial fragilities that now prevail a further intensification of stresses in one or more of these countries could trigger unwelcome spillovers for both the us economy and the international economy more generally  our interdependencies with mexico are particularly pronounced  second these economies have generally pursued prudent policies in recent years resulting in low inflation and roughly balanced current account and fiscal positions or in the case of singapore sizable surpluses  accordingly the stresses that these countries are feeling seem largely to reflect financial contagion effects from the advanced economies including sharp reductions in risk appetite rapid deleveraging by global investors and a drying up of liquidity in dollar funding markets  third there is good reason to believe that swap lines with the federal reserve would be helpful in defusing the economic and financial pressures that they now face  these lines would promote financial stability by helping to ensure that financial institutions and corporations in these countries have access to dollar liquidity  dollar funding pressures in brazil and korea appear to have intensified significantly  such pressures remain less acute in mexico and singapore but the authorities there view these lines as valuable protection should such pressures intensify particularly over yearend  in
addition the authorities in these countries have expressed the view that these lines could provide a significant boost to confidence although such outcomes are admittedly hard to predict
i turn now to two questions that have been the focus of energetic deliberations among the staff as we have formulated these proposals  first is there some better approach that we could recommend  second what are the risks associated with initiating swap facilities with these emerging market economies or emes
as for the first question we could ask these countries to rely on their sizable stocks of foreign exchange reserves  across many contingencies we believe that these countries do have sufficient resources to address financial pressures on their own  consistent with this observation they dont have any immediate plans to draw on their swap lines  in this sense the lines serve as a backstop  however in the event of intensified stresses we believe that it would be desirable for these countries to able to meet the dollar funding needs of their institutions by drawing on the swaps rather than by going into the treasury or agency markets to liquefy their foreign exchange reserves  alternatively we could ask these countries to go to the imf tomorrow the fund is likely to approve a large rapidly disbursing facility that might be appropriate  that said we see the imfs efforts in this area as broadly complementary to those of the federal reserve  meeting the potential liquidity needs of these large countries would strain the available resources of the fund  conversely the fund is much better placed than we are to judge the liquidity needs of smaller less systemically important countries  as an additional consideration these toptier emes that we are recommending for swap lines are very reluctant to return to the imf  given the strength of their policies they no longer view themselves as clients of the fund and would prefer to go it alone rather than seek imf financial support
we note that there are indeed risks associated with our recommendation  one obvious concern is that the swaps might not be repaid  however given the large reserve holdings of these countries their prudent policies the weight they place on good relations with us and the safeguards built into the swap agreements we judge the risk to federal reserve resources to be very low  more notable is the risk that approving these lines might cause us to be flooded with requests from many additional emes  nevertheless in proposing lines with these four countries we feel that we have set the bar quite high  their importance to the global economy and the quality of their policies set a standard that few if any other emes can match  in addition the potential imf liquidity swap facility might be helpful to us in limiting the risk of a slippery slope as additional countries that request lines with us could be asked to go to the imf  similarly european emes seeking swap lines could be encouraged to approach the ecb
in assessing these issues the staff has conferred with senior officials at the us treasury and the state department  in both instances these agencies emphasized the global economic significance of brazil mexico korea and singapore  however they also cautioned that expanding the swap lines beyond this group could leave us
increasingly vulnerable to a pile on effect which might manifest itself either in a large number of additional swap line requests or in political pressure  given these considerations the staff would benefit from some signal from the fomc regarding  its willingness to consider swap lines with other emerging market economies  we see two broad options in this regard  first the fomc could indicate that it is not inclined to establish swap lines with other emes  inquiries from additional countries could be forwarded to the imf  alternatively the fomc could emphasize that the bar for any additional eme facilities is high and that swap lines would be extended only if the case is seen as being comparable to that of the four countries that are being voted on today  under this second approach the fomc might consider granting the foreign currency subcommittee the authority to establish swap lines with the central banks of other large and systemically important emes  bill bassett will now continue our presentation
mr bassett2  thank you nathan  i will be referring to the exhibits labeled in red staff presentation on financial developments  the intermeeting period was characterized by persistent strains in financial markets and a sharp drop in asset prices although some markets have improved in recent days the ongoing disruptions have generated intense pressures on financial institutions and have contributed to a significant further tightening of credit conditions for households and businesses  as bill dudley noted spreads on credit default swaps cds for financial institutions have been quite volatile  as shown by the top left panel of your first exhibit median spreads for large bank holding companies the black line and regional commercial banks the red line declined substantially after the announcement of the treasurys capital purchase program and the fdics temporary liquidity guarantee program on october 14 they ended the period almost 70 basis points lower on balance  the median cds spread for insurance companies the blue line increased substantially over the latter part of the intermeeting period amid concerns about the financial condition of these firms  judging from the wide range of dealers price quotes on cds for the same firms shown in the top right panel liquidity and price discovery in the cds market remain strained

the functioning of markets for corporate debt is also impaired  as shown by the blue line in the middle left panel the staffs proxy for the bidasked spread on high yield bonds spiked to more than 4 percent before partially reversing course over the past week  this spread is also unusually elevated for investmentgrade bonds the black line  as shown to the right the average bidasked spread on syndicated loans traded in the secondary market the black line jumped up over the intermeeting period  secondary market prices for syndicated loans the blue line dropped to unprecedented levels reportedly reflecting heavy sales by hedge funds that were forced to meet investor redemptions as well as the unwinding of some types of structured investments
municipal finance the subject of the bottom two panels was significantly disrupted by dislocations in money market mutual funds in september and record

2  the materials used by mr bassett are appended to this transcript appendix 2
withdrawals from longterm municipal bond funds in early october  markets for structured products such as tenderoption bonds that issued shortterm variablerate debt backed by longerterm municipal bonds were particularly affected  yields on those shortterm instruments shown by the black line in the bottom left panel jumped for a time and the sales of the underlying longterm bonds as the structures unwound boosted longterm municipal bond yields the blue line  as shown to the right issuance slowed substantially until midoctober when a few statesnotably californiaplaced a sizable amount of new debt though they paid fairly elevated interest rates to do so  in recent days however liquidity conditions have shown signs of improvement yields have decreased somewhat and issuance has moved back up from the extremely slow pace seen in the second half of september and the first half of this month
please turn to exhibit 2  as noted by bill dudley prime money market funds suffered a wave of redemptions in midseptember shown by the red bars in the top left panel  although the flows diminished after the federal reserve and the treasury announced steps to support money funds on september 19 prime funds lost about onefifth of their assets on net over the intermeeting period  as a result prime funds have dramatically reduced their holdings of commercial paper generating significant disruptions in that market  as shown by the black line in the top right panel unsecured financial commercial paper outstanding has declined sharply since mid
september and the ongoing contraction in abcp the blue line has continued  in contrast the amount of unsecured commercial paper placed by nonfinancial firms the yellow line was little changed on net over the period  as shown in the middle left panel broad equity prices the black line dropped about 30 percent over the intermeeting period as the outlook for both economic growth and earnings dimmed and implied volatility increased to record levels  as depicted by the red bars to the right those developments were accompanied by record outflows of about 60 billion from equity mutual funds in september  weekly data indicate that over the first half of october investors withdrew more than 100 billion from longterm mutual funds including about 70 billion from equity funds but outflows have slowed in recent days
as shown in line 1 in the bottom left panel m2 expanded rapidly in september and early october as some firms and households shifted toward safer assets  liquid deposits line 2 increased significantly in september and stayed about flat in october  in contrast retail money funds line 3 were little changed in september but have grown briskly this month  the sizable increases in small time deposits in both months line 4 were widespread in contrast to the more concentrated gains seen over the summer in response to elevated yields at a few financial institutions  currency line 5 began increasing rapidly in recent weeks apparently supported by higher demand from both foreign and domestic holders
as a result of the disruptions in shortterm funding markets a range of borrowers turned to banks for funding  the other loans category the blue line in the bottom right panel rose sharply beginning in midseptember as a result of both unplanned
overdrafts and draws on existing credit lines by nonfinancial businesses money market mutual fund complexes foreign banks nonbank financial institutions and municipalities  ci loans at banks the black line have also increased significantly in recent weeks as a broad spectrum of nonfinancial firms tapped existing credit lines  according to the october senior loan officer opinion survey however about 25 percent of the largest banks and 35 percent of other banks surveyed indicated that ci loans not made under previous commitment accounted for some of the recent increase
additional results from the survey are the subject of your next exhibit  large net fractions of institutions reported having continued to tighten their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months with some banks reporting that they had tightened lending policies considerably  as shown by the black line in the top left panel about 80 percent of domestic respondents tightened their lending standards on ci loans since july and all but one of the 54 banks surveyed reported charging higher spreads over their cost of funds on such loans the red line  as noted to the right nearly all the banks that tightened standards or terms did so in response to a more uncertain or less favorable economic outlook and a reduced tolerance for risk  almost 40 percent of domestic banks tightened in part because of concerns about their capital or liquidity position somewhat more than had cited those pressures in july  as indicated in the middle left panel a large fraction of domestic banks again reported tightening standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months
moving to loans to households almost 70 percent of respondents tightened standards on residential mortgages to prime borrowers the red line in the middle  right panel  as shown by the blue line nearly 90 percent of the institutions that originated nontraditional mortgages tightened standards on such loans  as shown by the short black line in the bottom left panel about 75 percent of the respondents tightened lending standards on home equity lines of credit and about 60 percent tightened standards on both credit cards the blue line and other consumer loans the red line  as noted to the right almost 25 percent of banks on net reported reducing the credit limits on existing credit card accounts of some prime customers over the past three months and about 60 percent of banks reported cutting existing lines of some of their nonprime borrowers  banks that had trimmed the limits on existing credit card accounts most often cited the more uncertain economic outlook as a very important reason followed in turn by a reduced tolerance for risk and deterioration in the credit quality of individual customers
business finance is the subject of your next exhibit  the spread on bbbrated bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations the blue line in the top left panel rose about 275 basis points over the intermeeting period to more than 600 basis points whereas that on bonds of financial firms the black line reached nearly 1000 basis points before easing some in recent days  as spreads spiked and volatility increased bond issuance by both nonfinancial and financial corporations shown in the table to the right dropped appreciably in the third quarter row 3 relative to the pace seen in
the first half of the year row 2  as shown in the last row there has been no high yield issuance by nonfinancial firms so far this month and bond issuance by financial firms has come to a near halt
in commercial mortgage markets secondary market spreads on aaarated commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs shown in the middle left panel continued to increase on net and no new cmbs have been issued for several months as noted to the right using announced earnings for about 200 firms and analysts estimates for the rest the staff expects thirdquarter sp 500 earnings to come in about 10 percent below the level posted in the third quarter of last year  losses at financial companies account for the drop  bank holding companies reported further substantial writedowns on mortgagerelated and other securities as well as higher loanloss provisions necessitated by widespread deterioration in credit quality  in contrast earnings of nonfinancial companies are projected to have risen about
12 percent from a year earlier but increased profits of energy companies account for virtually all of those gains  as indicated in the bottom left panel analysts have revised down significantly their expectations for earnings of nonfinancial firms the red line over the next year likely in response to the worsening economic outlook
expected earnings for financial firms the black line also have been cut further this month  a rough estimate of the equity premium shown in the bottom right panel stands at an extremely high level
the household sector is the subject of your last exhibit  as shown by the top left panel interest rates on conforming residential mortgages have been volatilepartly in response to the renewed pressures on gse debt noted by bill dudleybut ended the period only slightly higher at around 6 percent  the staff expects home prices the black line to the right to decline significantly further through the end of 2010 and mortgage debt the red line to be about flat over that period  both paths have been marked down from the september forecast to reflect a weaker economic outlook and tighter credit conditions  spreads on assetbacked securities backed by credit card loans the black line in the middle left panel and auto loans the red line have risen more than 150 basis points since midseptember moving well above their spring peaks  the cumulative increase in spreads since midyear has hindered issuance of such securities and the volume of new deals shown to the right dropped more than 50 percent in the third quarter  the latest data available through
october 17 suggest that very little issuance has occurred this month  as shown in the bottom left panel consumer credit has decelerated recently  with lending conditions likely to remain tight and with spending on durables expected to be soft the staff sees significant further weakness in consumer credit in coming quarters
summing up although there has been modest improvement in several financial markets recently the worsening of the global financial crisis sharply increased pressures on financial firms and markets over the intermeeting period as a whole those pressures have led to further deleveraging diminished liquidity increased concerns among investors about the economic outlook and a reduced tolerance for risktaking  the resulting sharp fall in asset prices and the further tightening of credit
conditions have had substantial adverse effects on nonfinancial businesses and households  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  im going to open up in a minute to questions
for bill nathan and bill  i want to say just three brief things about the emerging market swaps
first we have been talking with these countries for some time and i think when the
conversations began it was more of a preventive measure than a response to conditions  but the
emes are now at a flashpoint in the financial crisis and as i think linda kole will probably
discuss the urgency has increased and the risks to the broader global economy are probably
higher than they were a few weeks ago  second with respect to the choice of four countries that
nathan proposedas he mentioned we have talked to the treasury and the state department  i
spoke to secretaries paulson and rice about this  there was an interesting confluence of
agreement that if you are going to do this these are the right four countries and we probably
shouldnt do more both from an economic perspective and a diplomatic perspective in the sense
that these are the countries that among the emerging markets are the most important from a
financial and economic point of view  third as i think nathan also mentioned the imf is
planning to create a liquidity facility which will be a lowconditionality facility available to a
broad range of countries  so there has been some discussion back and forth about the
relationship between this if we do it and the imf facility  i had a conversation this morning
with dominique strausskahn the head of the imf and we agreed that the two facilities are
complementarythat ours would provide important additional resources to the total availability
of liquid resources for these countries  if we decide to take this step we have agreed that
tomorrow after the imf board approves their facility we would jointly announce these two
actions so that it would create an impression of cooperation and coordination between the
federal reserve and the imf
so those are just a few additional pieces of information  im sure that you have plenty of
questions  who is first  no one  ah president fisher
mr fisher  just to follow up on your note mr chairman i spent four years as the
senior trade negotiator with all four of these countries and id just like to comment on their
importance to us  mexico is obvious  its a national security risk  were interlinked
economically  they have a sophisticated central bank and a very good central bank governor
and i think that would be number one on the list  singapore is unique  i doubt that singapore
would ever go to the imf  it would be beneath lee kuan yews dignity  it is a vital link in
terms of that sphere of the world  you made the case earlier or at least nathan made a case as
to the uniqueness of singapore  in terms of brazil id say that is the dodgiest of the lot
however we should remember that 40 percent of the gdp of latin america south of the
yucatan is produced by that one country and roughly 60 percent of the population is represented
by that one country  it has made significant progress since cardoso was president and it is a
robust economy relatively speaking  every economy in latin america borders upon it  it does
have a unique negotiating historyand tim knows this as well as i do having spent a lot of time
negotiating with thembut i would say that it is a critical part of our hemisphere and that is the
justification for including them in the package  finally we have been trying to negotiate a free
trade agreement with korea for some time  korea is an underrepresented country in terms of
discussions about developments in that part of the globe and yet it is inordinately successful  i
would argue that it is also a strong case to make  the only other country that i would include
under the rubric that we might ever consider is chile  even though it is tiny its representation is
important and its nature unique  i think you could justify doing this by virtue of their immediate
impact on our economy their unique role in our hemisphere and the fact that i doubt that they
would want to go to the imf in the first place  therefore it is complementary to the package
you announced earlier  my only discomfort in the discussion would be the idea of allocating to
the foreign currency subcommittee the authority to approve additional countries  as to the
supplement for these four countries that has been proposed i would be in favor of that  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i thought there was some pretty good risk
management described in the memo but i didnt really follow or dont understand exactly the
process by which we would generate a loss through these swap lines  could you take us through
the state of the world in which we would actually generate a loss  i raised this question before
with the industrialized countries and the answer was that because those are very high quality
countries we dont really have to worry about that  i understand that they follow pretty
reasonable economic policies during normal times  but what are the safeguards and what would
be the process by which we would generate a loss
mr sheets  i very much agree with the thrust of the questionit would take a very
severe state of nature for us to sustain losses on these  we are protected by the full faith and
credit of our central bank counterparty  in addition to that when we give them dollars we take
their domestic currency  so i suppose in some very extreme state of the world one could
imagine that the loan that was made in dollars defaulted on the central banks the central bank
chose not to make us whole and the currency that was escrowed for us had depreciated
significantly in value  but id say that you are multiplying three very small possibilities
particularly the last two that the central bank would choose to default on us and there would
have to be such a substantial fall in their currency that it would reduce the value of that effective
assurance or collateral or whatever you want to call it
mr evans  okay  but it would be that we have their currency and presumably that
would be a state in which it had depreciated
mr sheets  absolutely  these would function very similarly to the swap lines that
we have with the advanced economies  in addition we are going to allow them to draw only
5 billion at a time at the discretion of the foreign currency subcommittee  when the foreign
currency subcommittee makes the determination as to whether or not a drawing should occur it
has the scope and the mandate to look broadly at what is happening in the economy and make
sure that the resources are going to be used in a manner that is consistent with the terms and the
expectations of the swap agreement
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  a clarifying question mr chairman  nathan on page
4 of the memo at the last bullet you say frbny would have broad setoff rights
mr sheets  yes indeed  maybe trish and bill want to jump in here as well  what
this means is that in extinguishing any obligation that arises from the swap agreement if the
central bank for some reason doesnt pay us we can take other assets on the books that are being
held by the federal reserve bank of new york to extinguish those liabilities  does that make
sense  so if the brazilians are holding some additional assets at the new york fed that are
unrelated to the swap and they are not making good on the swap we can draw on those other
assets to extinguish the obligations from the swap
mr rosengren  but there is nothing that prevents them from withdrawing those
assets before that right  presumably if theyre in a situation of default they would withdraw
any treasury securities held here first
mr sheets  they could do that  but any drawing under the swap agreement would
be no longer than three months and some drawings would be much shorter  so they would have
to move very quickly given the short nature of these transactions  but there are certain states of
nature that are so severe that we couldnt rule it out
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  let me just state my understanding of this so that i can
be corrected by nathan or by bill  these countries hold substantial amounts of their reserves in
dollars  they hold a substantial fraction of those dollars in accounts at the new york fed  if
they defaulted on their piece of the swap and the falling value of their currency left us with some
exposure we would have the ability to take assets from their accounts to cover any loss  so its
better than the fact that this is a sovereign credit and it is better than the fact that we have an
asset on the other side of the swap because they hold substantial foreign exchange reserves with
us  the way to think about this is just as a mechanism to help them transform the composition of
their dollar reserves in a way that might be more effective in responding to lenderoflastresort
needs in dollars rather than having to sell treasuries or agencies into the market in a period of
panic or distress to meet that cash need  i meant it as a confirming question
mr sheets  i agree
mr stern  but i thought we were concerned about a shortage of treasury collateral in
the market  so why wouldnt we want them to sell and in fact what are reserves for if they
dont use them in these circumstances
vice chairman geithner  i have never stood in their shoes so im not sure i
fully understand it  you are right that the world is a little short of the riskfree asset now and so
a greater supply would be terrific in some sense  but they have a general view which i think our
people share that to meet the kind of lumpy unpredictable potentially large needs for lenderof
lastresort purposes you may face in our currency you have to manage reserves in a way that you
can meet those needs without selling treasuries or agencies  it would not be so terrific for the
world  i have never stood on the other side but thats my basic sense  another way to think
about this is that the privilege of being the reserve currency of the world comes with some
burdens  not that we have an obligation in this sense but we have an interest in helping these
guys mitigate the problems they face in dealing with currency mismatches in their financial
systems  we have an interest in helping them meet that in some sense  its not our obligation
we have the same basic interest that led us to be responsive to the european need in some cases
these guys are different in that they actually have managed the countries balance sheets better
because they at least have a huge amount of their assets in dollars  that should make us in some
ways as comfortable asmaybe more comfortable thandoing it with the europeans because
they ran a banking system that was allowed to get very very big relative to gdp with huge
currency mismatches and with no plans to meet the liquidity needs of their banks in dollars in the
event that we face a storm like this
chairman bernanke  president lacker you had a twohander
mr lacker  yes  president geithner you described the emes as motivated by a
desire to transform their reserves from illiquid treasuries or from treasuries to some more
fungible and more convenient form of dollars  that strongly suggests collateralizing their swap
line with the treasuries rather than their own currency  what would be the disadvantage of
doing that
vice chairman geithner  i think effectively we have done that by the way in
which the thing is structured
mr lacker  but the point that president evans made is that were not constraining
them to not withdraw the reserves
vice chairman geithner  do you mean that you want to put a reserve floor on
them too
chairman bernanke  the question is whether in an unlikely but possible state of
the world in which they dont want to pay us back they could withdraw their treasuries in
advance of defaulting
mr lacker  or we could lend to them collateralized by the treasuries rather than by
their own currency
vice chairman geithner  well lots of things are possible  i think this is a pretty
good conservative balance
chairman bernanke  that would basically be a repo agreement i guess
mr sheets  for what its worth the ecb has entered into something similar to that
with the hungarians in which the hungarians are able to repo to them longterm euro
denominated stuff and get euros back
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thanks  i think id be a little concerned about stigmatizing the swaps by
saying that we have enough doubts about these other countries that we need to take collateral
we dont have confidence that their central banks will meet the obligations that they have taken
on  so my preference would be to stick with the extension of our current swap agreements to
these countries  i think they all are using their reserves to some extent already so this is not a
case of them not touching their reserves and instead taking the swaps  they say they dont
intend to use them but they could very well use them  theyre already using them
the other market that the treasury has expressed some concern about is the agency
market  if they were just meeting a huge demand for treasuries by selling treasuries that might
be one thingalthough intermediate and longerterm treasury yields themselves have moved
up presumably because of supply pressures there  but the agency spreads have widened quite a
bit and i think forcing them to sell agencies in a kind of lumpy way would feed back on our
mortgage markets  it would not be in our interest
chairman bernanke  president fisher a twohander
mr fisher  just responding to president lacker  i think it would be an insult to these
four parties particularly given the fact that we appear to have negotiated again the ability to
attach other assets  i am frankly surprised that singaporeans would go along with that  if we
got that id use it and pocket it  but i would argue especially for the case of mexico that i
dont see any reason that we should differentiate between them and canada for example  it
would stigmatize them in a way and it would be an insult to these people  at the same time as i
think i understand the explanation from vice chairman geithner and from nathan we do have
some rampedup security hereso its a special arrangement  i think going further than that
would not be appropriate
chairman bernanke  let me say just a couple of quick things  one is that this
would require renegotiating the whole thing from the beginning and we would like if possible
to do this tomorrow with the imf  the second point i would make is that we do have
considerable security and we will be dispensing thisunder strict conditionsin limited
tranches  i think we could monitor pretty well what was going on  but the point is well taken
president plosser
mr plosser  i have just a clarification  this is a question  dont we already have a
swap line a standing facility with mexico as a part of nafta  so we dont have to add it
mr sheets  we do have a swap line with mexico  its a standing swap line  its
3 billion under the north american framework agreement  its the counterpart to nafta
under that agreement we also have a 2 billion swap line with canada  here we would be
adding a new temporary liquidity swap line so it would be a new legal construct
mr plosser  i guess my question is why we cant use the swap line that is already in
existence
mr sheets  in principle if you were so inclined you could probably just raise the
size of the existing swap line to 30 billion  however we built in a variety of mechanisms and
safeguards in this proposal  in addition the structure of what were putting forward is tailored
particularly to meet the kinds of challenges and liquidity pressures that exist right now  so in
some sense this one is structured to meet the challenges that the mexicans are most likely to face
in the current episode rather than the more generic one that already exists on the books
chairman bernanke  let me go to president rosengren who has been waiting
patiently
mr rosengren  i have two unrelated questions  one follows up on this but the
other one is on the term auction facility  first given how much we have expanded the term
auction facility is there any consideration to having a minimum stopout rate given that the last
two have had fairly low stopout rates  i wonder if that was being considered at all given how
much we expanded the size  then the second question gets to the stigma issue related to the
swap lines  there was quite a lot of discussion about how to differentiate the countries  i had
the same thought that president lacker hadif we could have setoff rights that enable them to
collateralize the swaps  i do think going to the imf will attach a fair amount of stigma to the
organization  so i am worried that the spillover benefits to other countries will be negative not
positive because of that stigma  one option would be to say that either you could go to the imf
or we would provide collateralized loans for other than these four since it sounds as though
these four are a done deal  but rather than trying to draw the line and figure out whether chile or
some other country is appropriate we could collateralize it  if they held enough treasury
securities at the new york fed then it would seem that we would have no reason not to do it  if
they didnt have treasury securities which would probably partly reflect some of their own
mismanagement in their countries then they wouldnt be able to use the facility and would have
to use the imf  but it would seem to be a way to get around some of the stigma issues if
someone chose to come to us and fully collateralize it  that might be an alternative way to draw
the line rather than trying to come up with criteria that seemed a little difficult to understand as i
went through the memo
mr dudley  under the term auction facility there is a minimum bid rate the ois
rate  so when we have a 150 billion auction and lets say there are propositions of 120 billion
the winning bid rate is the ois rate for everybody
mr rosengren  but im just wondering as the ois rate has come down when you
think of the band that we have for excess reserves it does seem that the ois provides a much
bigger band for example than what we have even for excess reserves  i wonder whether during
periods in which people are considering a reduction of as much as 50 or more basis points the
ois ends up being a very low lower bound
mr dudley  yes right now it is a very low rate because the market is building in
future rate cuts  so i think the ois rate is now below 1 percent on a threemonth basis
mr rosengren  but as we narrow the target for excess reserves and have a narrow
band there you wonder whether the stopout rate having a lower band that is a little higher than
the ois might be an alternative way to think about it now that we have the excess reserves
option as to the lower bound
mr dudley  i think that is something worth considering  the emphasis right now
has been getting term funding out in as much size as possible and not worrying so much about
whether the cost of the funds is or is not at a penalty  so i think the emphasis of the program did
shift a bit over the past six weeks  obviously if things settle down and the demand at the taf
auctions subsides then you can have the option of cutting the size of the auctions or increasing
the minimum bid rate or some combination of the two
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i make an amendment to erics
question or suggestion  i think that when we have a chance to breathe and we feel as though we
have achieved some durable stability in the panic then we will want to reassess not just the basic
complement of our facilities and how we think about the future but the relative economics of
what weve done with the dollar swaps and our existing openend auction facilities for
institutions  ideally we want a situation in which it is more attractive for them to borrow from
their foreign central banksthe dollars we provided through the swapsthan to come to us in
our auctions and other areas through their us affiliates
i am a bit less troubled by the point you made than i am by the fact that we have set up a
regime in which the incentives for them to come to our facilities are still substantial when they
have now the ability they didnt have before to go to their foreign central banks for dollars in
large scale  as we think about consolidation and not just exitabout how we prepare the
ground for a shift over timei think we want to come back to looking at the relative economics
between our dollar facilities for us banks and us affiliates of foreign banks and what is open
to them from their home country central banks now  as part of that we could think about size
reserve price and price in our auction
mr dudley  the awkward thing right now is that we are trying to add liquidity as
powerfully as we can  so to raise the minimum bid rate or do anything that somehow suggests a
pulling back would be a bit inconsistent with the liborois spread widening that we have seen
and the fact that it still remains very very elevated  you might want to do exactly what you
suggested president rosengren at some future date but i think that doing it now would send a
very mixed message to the market  i think people would be confused about what we are doing
chairman bernanke  president hoenig  im sorry nathan had an answer
mr sheets  could i just respond to president rosengrens second question
chairman bernanke  go ahead
mr sheets  i think you put your finger on two very difficult judgments that we made
when structuring this facility  i dont see the risk of creating stigma for emerging market
economies that are not in our swap network as being a firstorder concern  it is broadly
recognized that the folks that we are recommending are larger more systemically important and
as well managed as anybody else  if you were sitting down to make a listand the fund has
recently done thisthe economies that were recommending would be at the top of the list and i
think that is recognized by essentially all observers  so i see what were doing here as really
ratifying perceptions rather than creating new ones
on the second point the choice between the swaps versus the repos that one is
particularly tricky  i very much agree that the repos would give us a little more security  on the
other hand the swap framework gives the emerging market economies a little more flexibility
as to how they are going to proceed as president fisher mentioned it also creates symmetry
between the industrial countries and the way were treating them and the emerging markets and
the way were treating them  given the successes of many of these economies over the past ten
years i see this as being an appropriate step  nevertheless i admit that the choice between the
swaps and the repos is a difficult one  another thought is that the repo structure might provide a
bit more security but we have tried to get that security through other waysthrough tranching
careful reviews and so on
chairman bernanke  president hoenig im sorry  go ahead
mr hoenig  no no  in fact it follows right on with what nathan was just answering
that is for the moment we are creating kind of a broader inlist for these four countries and
stigma with the nonaccepted group at this point  what will happen then if we do have an issue
that involvespick a countrychile  are we going to send them to the imf  are we going to
have our subcommittee make a decision as to whether to give them a swap  if we do that will
that then create uncertainties about others  are you really not concerned about the stigma and
the implications of this especiallyi guess they are asking this in anticipation of the possibility
even though they think its fairly remotewould we not be increasing the probabilities of a
problem by doing this now  i know these are tough questions but in this environment i am
anticipating a bad event  so what do we do in the case of that bad event
mr sheets  i would hope that initiating these swaps would reduce the probability of
bad outcomes in the emerging market economies  certainly if brazil mexico and korea are up
against the ropes and experiencing significant financial stresses my sense is that it would be an
environment in which many other emes would be experiencing negative spillovers  so to the
extent that we can backstop these major linchpins in the emerging market world i see that as
having very positive effects for others  that would be one point  second the decision as to how
to handle chile if chile comes to us for a swap line i think is very much a policy decision for
the committee to determine  as i said in the remarks we as staff members would very much
appreciate some sort of signal from you as to whether you want to say four and thats all were
willing to do and everyone elsechile india and south africagoes to the fund  or is the
committee open to having potentially a few other large important emerging market economies
have swap lines with the federal reserve  i see that as being a policy decision
mr hoenig  but its something that we ought to think about sooner rather than later
because the likelihood is that if you take care of these four and you get another request you are
going to get three others and not one other
mr sheets  wherever you draw the line there is going to be somebody who is just a
bit away from the line that says i am very similar to those folks  i am reasonably comfortable
with where we draw the line  here there is as much gap as youre going to find  in my mind the
next one for which you could make a case would be india  however indias financial system
isnt as developed as is the case with these folks  they are not as integrated into the global
financial system as is the case with these so there is a bit of space there  but these are
admittedly hard judgments which we tried to flesh out regarding some of these issues in our
memo
mr fisher  have we been approached by any other countries
mr sheets  yes indeed we have  we have been approached by   552 usc b4  

 and we have had very informal inquiries from a couple of other countries including
      552 usc b4      
chairman bernanke  but we have not encouraged that
mr sheets  we have done everything we possibly can to discourage it
chairman bernanke  just to be clear
mr sheets  thats right  were not advertising
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  another question for nathan on swap lines is how this works
exactly  if the pattern holds and mexico for example supports its banking systemin the case
of mexico it is a little different from others in that all of the large banks are foreignowned
citibank owns banamex and the spanish banks own the other two or three large banks
where does our responsibility stop and theirs begin  is it possible for the subsidiary of a us
bank or a spanish bank to draw dollar liquidity in mexico and with fungible dollars move that
around the world  or does it in one manner or another stay in mexico
mr sheets  a couple of thoughts  certainly these homeversushost issues bedevil
many many discussions of banking issues right now  they are true in mexico as you suggested
and they are true in spades in central and eastern europe where instead of us banks there are
european banks in the tension between the home and host  so these considerations are very
relevant and also exceedingly complicated
if the bank of mexico or the mexican authorities move to address tensions in their
financial system the standard that has been set by several federal reserve actions the brits in
the things they have done and i believe a number of the other countries is to include subsidiaries
of foreign firms that are operating in that country  so for instance for the united states
deutsche banks us subsidiary has had access to our various facilities and that has been the
coin of the realm in the announcements today  so my feeling is that banamex which is owned
by citi would have the same access to these kinds of facilities as other mexican institutions
now there is no guarantee of that but that would be my feeling  regarding the question of
once a mexican institution gets its hands on dollars what happens to those dollars my
understanding is that they can move around  in fact in a discussion guillermo ortiz indicated
that to date mexican institutions were net suppliers of dollars to the united states rather than the
other way around
mr lockhart  so in the case of a foreign bankthey lend to a foreign bank in their
country in mexico in this casedefaulting whose problem is it  is it the home country
supervisors problem or is it mexicos problem visvis us
mr sheets  i would guess that it is a joint problem
chairman bernanke  vice chair
vice chairman geithner  im not sure that this is helpful but maybe i can give a
slightly different example from another perspective  we have a bunch of us affiliates of some of
the weakest european institutions that have faced very substantial dollar funding needs and have
come to us and asked for substantial ongoing access to liquidity  when they have a substantial
amount of lendable collateral collateral with substantial market value relative to the needs we have
been comfortable meeting those needs  when their needs have substantially exceeded or might
potentially exceed the market value of their eligible collateral then we have talked to the home
central bank  we have said that in effect if you want us to be able to meet those needs and they
have collateral in your market that is substantial relative to those needs then the better way for us to
do this is for the home country central bank to meet their dollar liquidity needs against the collateral
there or meet the liquidity needs and we provide the dollars worth of guarantees from the central
bank
so this homehost thing is a delicate balance and as nathan said it shouldnt all fall on the
host central bank  the best thing possible is for the home country central bank to take most of the
responsibility for meeting the liquidity needs and for us to help them facilitate that where necessary
but when those needs exceed what we would normally give in terms of access then you have to
have a conversation with the foreign central bank  so for example if a weak us institution in
mexico faces substantial needs in mexico well in excess of their eligible collateral in mexico i
suspect they would call us and say we want you to meet those needs  we would have to
consider at that point where they are in the liquiditysolvency spectrum and how comfortable we are
in meeting those needs
chairman bernanke  very good  president lacker
mr lacker  i have a question for the staff  you noted that the countries believed that
this would help market confidence  so the choice of extending a line is potentially consequential
here  i have a twopart question  first what do you think the risk is of the uncertainty surrounding
whether particular other countries will or will not in the future be able to obtain a swap line from the
federal reserve  second what would you suggest that we say if asked by the public or if the
chairman is asked in the congress about what criteria or principles we used to draw the line
between the countries that have swap lines and those that dont  i know that you posed the question
to us but what would you suggest that we say
mr sheets  as outlined in the memo and then also my remarks the first is that we are
looking for economies that are large and systemically important  the second is that we are looking
for economies in which their policies have been strong and it appears that they are largely being
influenced by contagion  the third piece is countries for which we believe that the swap line might
actually make a difference
now let me just give you a concrete case of the third criterion because thats a little more
abstract than the first two  iceland came to us and requested a swap line of approximately 1 billion
to 2 billion which would have been 5 to 10 percent of icelands gdpso it was fairly large
relative to the size of the country  but the liabilities of the banking system were on the order of
170 billion and the underlying problem was really that there was a loss of confidence in its banks
we came to the conclusion that a 1 billion to 2 billion swap line was very little ammunition to use
against a potential loss in confidence in this 170 billion financial system  for that reason we as
the staff recommended against a swap line for iceland
those are the three conditions that wed emphasize  sort of subsidiary to that is that i think
it is very appropriate for all the european emes to report to the ecb for their liquidity needs  that
would further constrain the list of countries that wed look at  as we work down the list of
countries i think it gets easier to say no in that fewer and fewer of the countries can make a case
that they are large and systemically important  with the risk of creating stigma some countries are
big and some arent and thats pretty darn objective  now you can debate about well whats big
and what isnt and where you draw the line but it just so happens that these three major economies
that were putting forward all have gdp of around 1 trillion  that seems like a reasonable line to
draw  again theres an element of arbitrariness here but any line you draw will have an element of
arbitrariness to it
mr lacker  and the first part of my question
mr sheets  oh i thought i got it  what was the first part
mr lacker  what sort of uncertainty might this engender about the likelihood of other
countries qualifying  my recollection is that many economists have claimed that the imf had this
trouble in the 1990s when interventions would give rise to uncertainty about subsequent
interventions in other cases
mr sheets  well i guess im not sure i know exactly what youre driving at  are you
concerned that by moving on these were sending a negative message about the ones were not
moving on
mr lacker  im just wondering about the uncertainty that might be created about the
lack of clarity about whos in whether this is the final list and so on
mr sheets  our press release that we are negotiating lists as clearly as one can in a
press release the criteria that we were looking atthat they are large wellmanaged fundamentally
sound systemically important countries  so we are trying to communicate that  in addition in
conversations when these folks come to usand especially if we get some direction from the
fomc as to how youd like to proceed on this issuewe can be very very blunt with them in
telling them why the answer is no or yes depending on which way the fomc goes
chairman bernanke  vice chair did you have a twohander
vice chairman geithner  well i just want to point out that i think these are
absolutely the right kinds of questions about this  but i think these concerns are substantially
mitigated by the fact that the imf is putting in place a facility at basically the same time which will
be there with relatively little stigma for a range of other countries that need it  there will be a
universe of other countries that would not meet the test for eligibility for this swap type of facility
for the imf or us that will have to go through a program with conditionality and a bunch of
adjustments such as iceland is going through or hungary will go through
so it is right to raise these questions  but the boundary problems around our swap lines are
substantially mitigated by the fact that there is a new facility coming out thats going to the same
place  raising the question of why we need to do our swaps is good too but youve heard lots of
good arguments for that and i think that realistically theres a natural division of labor between
what central banks have classically done with each other in the swap context and what the imf
does  what were doing is a natural extension of what central banks do  the imf is moving a little
further in from where they are in this case and i think that will mitigate some of the signaling
problems and uncertainty created by having this evolution in the scope of swap lines
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  i guess im worried about this for all of the considerations that president
hoenig and president lacker have just been talking about  i dont know where we draw the lines
and when we have to go to the state department and start asking what countries we can or cant
develop swap lines with im not sure those are the criteria we want to be using  we mentioned the
countries already  what happens when                             552 usc b4                            
  you can just go down the list

mr sheets  we have already said no to some of those
mr plosser  i understand but if you really follow the logic of the argument about being
large and systemically important if we draw a line somewhere we start expanding this now bit by
bit and we draw a line somewhere and the question then becomes will markets begin to question
other countries on the periphery and create problems  its not that any one of them
552 usc b4

 i dont know pick oneis large and systemically important but by doing what were
doing and creating the uncertainty that president lacker was referring to maybe we are forced to go
and do it collectively because they all band together and as a group say were all facing this
problem  why cant we have the same access  partly i like president rosengrens suggestion
about using repos with securities which we have here as a mechanism  alternatively if the imf is
creating a largely unconditional or low conditionality type of program why not just say that
everybody else goes to them first  if they tap out of the imf access maybe then we might consider
being a backstop rather than their coming to us in the first place  i just dont know where this ends
i think that with all of the questions you raised and tried to answer you hit it right on the head  on
all of them that you said were kind of marginal you went one way and im leaning the other way
on the same criteria
chairman bernanke  president plosser a couple of things  the imf has very
limited resources  theyre not remotely able to meet the needs of
mr plosser  we dont know what the needs are yet do we
chairman bernanke  well the resources are very limited  the other thing is that
the staff asked for guidance on the limits here  id like to propose that when we get to that point to
ask the voters to suggest how they stand and what qualifications they might have  one thing that
you could do for example would be to say i do or do not support this but if i do i think a very
sharp line should be drawn at this point and be communicated that way  the legislative history can
be part of this and we can communicate to the staff how we feel about potential extensions
mr sheets  just to put some numbers on imf lending capacitytotal imf lending
capacity is about 250 billion  to get even that high they have to call in some special arrangements
that they have with a variety of countries  the maximum capacity is 250 billion  so the
120 billion that were proposing today would be essentially half of what the imf could do  in that
sense i really see what were proposing as our taking off the imfs hands some of the largest
potential liquidity needs which then allows them to focus on a whole range of additional countries
a related point is that i understand that in an imf executive board meeting today the managing
director indicated that they are getting a fair amount of interest in this new facility  it really is a
different kind of facility and frankly even a week ago if you told me that the imf was going to be
able to put this facility together in this quick a time i would have said no way  theres no way
that the imf can move this quickly  so it is about as good as we could expect and maybe even
better than what we could have expected from the fund  i think that they are doing what they can to
minimize stigma  on the other hand they dont have enough lending capacity to really handle these
folks that were talking about today
chairman bernanke  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  in the bluebook here it says additionally
the swiss national bank announced plans to draw on its swap line to help finance up to 60 billion
in purchases of assets from a major swiss bank  so is that really what you have in mind here for a
country like brazilthat theyll draw on their swap line to purchase assets from banks
mr sheets  no and maybe the folks in new york want to talk a bit more about this
the transaction with the swiss national bank was a very special transaction that occurred outside
the typical constraints of the swap lines that wed be agreeing to with these folks  in the swap lines
with these folks they would have to tell us up front how theyre going to allocate the resources  we
would envision that it would be done in something similar to an auction in a very transparent
onmarket sort of way  but it would not be that kind of a transaction which was a special case in
order to help a particular financial institution
mr bullard  well if you think that there are systemically important institutions in
these countries why not
mr sheets  again were drawing lines here  i am not prepared to give these folks carte
blanche  thats why weve added additional safeguards and additional governance structures to
these facilities  maybe the committee has a different view on that but i wouldnt be prepared to let
them do whatever they wanted with these resources
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  to continue to grill you nathan
mr sheets  im earning my pay today
mr lockhart  you know the atmosphere right now is largely precautionary on their
partthey are well capitalized with foreign currency reserves  but if we want to deal with
hypotheticals lets assume that some of these recipients of the swap lines get into a liquidity crisis
is the european central bank being approached for swap lines  i recognize that they need dollar
liquidity but in a general liquidity crisis the euro would do as well to help  do we have any sense
of whether the ecb is considering swap lines for some of these emerging markets
mr sheets  i dont have details on that  as ive mentioned i know that they have
created a facility with the hungarians a 5 billion facility  they were also approached by iceland
at the same time that we were  i would speculate but i dont have any basis for that speculation
that given the emerging tensions in central and eastern europe and northern europe that they
probably are being approached but i dont have any details on that
ms mosser  my understanding is that they have been approached  i dont know what
decisions have been made other than the ones that may have been mentioned  in addition they have
opened a swap line with the danish central bank in euros which was virtually identical to the
dollar arrangement that we have with the danish central bank  so they definitely have been
approached for swap lines  on how many of them theyll put into place we dont have any
particular information at this point
mr lockhart  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  i just want to clear up the question  i think tim and nathan may have
both answered this but its a question that president lockhart raised earlier  in mexicos case for
example where almost all the major banks are foreign ownedeu banks spanish banksthose
banks clearly have access to dollars through the ecb swap line  theres no reason that the dollar
funding needs of those banks to the extent that they can move these things around cant be satisfied
by access to dollars from the ecb  is that a correct or an incorrect assumption
mr dudley  the collateral isnt always in the right place  you are absolutely right if
the collateral could be easily moved but the collateral oftentimes isnt in the right place
mr fisher  let me ask nathan a question to follow up if i may  obviously youve been
approached by the governor of the central bank of mexicoortiz has been here to visit
mr sheets  indeed
mr fisher  so whats his argument  i would assume that you asked these questions
mr sheets  yes absolutely
mr fisher  so inform us as to what his justification is
mr sheets  mexico is experiencing increased financial stresses particularly in its
corporate sector where recently some bad bets on structured finance products have emerged and
ortiz was very concerned about continued confidence in the mexican economy  now that said
from what he had to say dollar funding pressures had not yet emerged and he was emphatic that
they would not draw on these until the time that those funding pressures emerged or until the time
that they saw a significant further deterioration in conditions in their economy  he was very
specific about the fact that they would use their own reserves as their first second and third lines of
defense
mr kohn  just to add to that he said that to deal with the issue that nathan raised about
the problem with their businesses and the kind of dollar needs they had they were meeting those
needs out of their own foreign exchange reserves  so they were not going to engage in a swap with
us in order to meet that particular problem but they were concerned about the dollar pressures more
generally on their financial segment particularly as yearend approaches
chairman bernanke  if its okay maybe we could just go ahead with the votes on
this  id like first to do the open market operations which i hope are not too controversial  there
was no discussion of the new zealand swap line  ill ask to see if there is any comment on that
then on this issue ill take a set of positions from the voters if thats okay  so lets go back to
domestic open market operations
mr kohn  i move that we approve
chairman bernanke  without objection  the new zealand swap
mr kohn  i move we approve that too
chairman bernanke  is there any discussion or concern  all right  without
objection  now turning to the resolution on the eme swaps in the interest of time i proposeand
i hope it is okayto go through the voters and ask each one to state whether you are in favor or
opposed  you can say what you want and if you want whether you have some argument to make
or if youre conditionally in favorfor example im in favor if x or if we do ybut just to get a
sense of where everybody is and then well decide what to do  okay  so lets go down the roll
here  im in favor
mr fisher  any conditionality
chairman bernanke  i think we should be fairly tough at this point  vice
chairman
vice chairman geithner  im in favor  on the basic question of how you would
deal with other requests beyond the four nathan gave two options  one is that you delegate to the
subcommittee discretion to make those judgments  the second option was to say no not without
coming back to the committee  i do think it makes sense to see how the imf thing works and how
it is received how much participation they get and how these boundary problems and the signaling
problem play out and it is probably a good idea for the committee to have at least a briefing about
how that is playing out so that there is some context going forward  i would be in favor of your
delegating that authority to the subcommittee as you would expect me to be just because
sometimes these judgments need to be made quickly  but i certainly understand why people would
want to have a better sense of how this is unfolding and how we deal with it  the boundary
problems are going to get worse if we have to go broader than this
chairman bernanke  governor duke
ms duke  im in favor
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  im in favor mr chairman and i would also favor in terms of the screening
device for future requests that you come back to the full committee  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  thats understood  governor kohn
mr kohn  im in favor mr chairman  i think these boundary problems are difficult  i
agree with the vice chairman that our having the imf there mitigates them  i was encouraged by
nathans sense that there are some people interested in the imf so there might not be much stigma
there  i would be in favor of very strongly encouraging other countries to go to the imf
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  i too favor the facility  i think its very important that we are tranching
this and using somewhat different ways of providing the money to these countries than we have
with other countries because as president bullard and others mentioned if were not careful this
could be used for purposes with which we are not comfortable  it could be used for supporting a
currency and i dont think wed be particularly comfortable with that  obviously we have to be
realistic  money is fungible  they have very large reserves  they could be using the reserves for
these other purposes and using the swaps for purposes that we find acceptable  but i think given
the circumstances it makes sense to be coming up with something thats complementary to the imf
facility and make sure that the imf facility and our facility together are sufficient to deal with the
pressures in this environment  i would be satisfied to delegate the authority to the subcommittee
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  im also in favor of the program and i agree with vice chairman
geithners comments that this announcement along with the imf program should be sufficient  but
if there are other requests i think it is important to bring them back to the committee
chairman bernanke  understood  president plosser
mr plosser  i guess ill approve but with reluctance  i think this is a very slippery
slope  im worried about other central banks ganging up on us as a group saying that they have to
have this  i would prefer that even these large countries use some combination of the imf facility
plus their own reserves to meet these needs  i think that would be a better outcome and better for us
in that regard  so thats a very reluctant yea vote  id also insist that any further expansion come
back before this committee
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  im reluctantly in favor of this  i wont elaborate very much  im just not
persuaded that this is a very valuable contribution as best as i can judge it  i would be in favor of
limiting it to these four countries  i dont know if thats credible though  certainly i would be in
favor of any additional considerations coming back to the full committee
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  mr chairman i support the proposal on the floor  i think the safeguards are
meaningful and real and should help  i think the bar for further consideration as nathan described
should be high but we shouldnt overstate what that bar is given how circumstances can change
quickly  i wouldnt want to have to change that rule in the middle of the game but i think the high
bar language works  on the question of delegating to the subcommittee i think in the interest of
speed it would be appropriate but given the sense around the table certainly making sure that the
folks around the table were at the very least briefed as to the thought process might be a prudent
path forward
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  so the sense i hear is that people are
willing to accept it but the bar for additional countries should be high  we should bring any
country that we propose to add back to the fomc for approval and we will keep you well briefed
on the conditionality the draws and anything else that happens  okay  may i have a motion
mr kohn  so moved
chairman bernanke  i am going to say without objection because we had a
unanimous view  okay  thank you  let me go on next to the economic situation
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes
mr lacker  do we have time for a brief question for the manager about the funds
market  it has behaved a little unusually in the last period
chairman bernanke  go ahead
mr lacker  thank you mr chairmani appreciate this  i have a threepart question
as you said in your presentation the effective funds rate the average of brokered transactions has
been below the interest rate on reserves and there are all of these institutions that apparently arent
eligible to earn interest on reserves  one whats the policy reason for excluding them from
eligibility for interest on reserves  i understand the policy reason for excluding them from credit
but this is the opposite and so im not quite sure why we screen them out  second as i read the
data on your operations it seems to me as though we have added enough reserves to drive the funds
rate virtually down to the interest rate on reserves  i want to know if thats a fair characterization of
the state of open market operations and the funds rate  third im interested in knowing especially
if thats true why dont we just give up and say that the interest rate on reserves is our target rate
mr dudley  okay  let me take them in reverse order  i dont like to give up but if i
could just exclude that portion of it its possible that you might want to consider the interest rate on
reserves or some reasonable facsimile thereof as your target because that is essentially the riskfree
rate that banks face  that may be the purer measure of what youre really trying to accomplish in
terms of its link to monetary policy than the federal funds rate  its possible  there are obviously
important governance issues that surround that choice though in terms of whats the boards
prerogative and whats the fomcs prerogative  but thats a completely reasonable thing to think
about just as long as we dont characterize that as giving up
have we added enough reserves to drive the federal funds rate down to the interest on
reserves  well i think not  i wouldnt look at it quite that way because the gap in principle if other
things are not going on should be the difference between us as a counterparty and a bank as a
counterparty  one is an unsecured loan between one bank and another bank and the other is us as
the counterparty  so normally there should be a spread between the interest on reserves and the
federal funds rate  now obviously what complicates that in the current environment is the federal
deposit insurance corporations guarantee on interbank funds going forward  so federal funds may
be coveredin fact they look as though they could be covered by that guarantee  in that
circumstance one might argue that the federal funds rate and interest on reserves should probably
be the same rate because theres no difference in credit risk
mr lacker  excuse me  without interest rates on reserves theres that spread plus a
scarcity factor and weve essentially driven that scarcity factor down to zerothats how i meant
the question
mr dudley  right but i still think that generally a bank faced with a choice of having
risk with the fed or selling fed funds to another bank would want to be compensated for that risk of
selling so they are going to get some positive spread
mr lacker  i understand that
mr madigan  i would say that we may well be in a situation where the interest rate on
excess reserves is the effective tool for controlling the federal funds rate and there may be a spread
as bill said we are in the process of learning how this works and it may well be the case that we
need to push that interest rate on excess reserves very close to the federal funds rate
mr dudley  it would not surprise me at all if when we are finished with this processi
hope over the next six weeks as we go through a couple more reserve maintenance period rounds
that that margin might be zero and we might see the federal funds rate trading right on top of the
interest rate on reserves  but we are going to have to see  i think our presumption at the current
time would be to recommend to the board next round to narrow that spread furtherit is 35 basis
points today  another thing that we dont know is how much learning is going to go on by banks
so the selling of fed funds below the interest rate on reserves is not just the gses it is also banks
and so its a little hard to understand exactly why theyre doing that unless the leverage ratio is
whats driving that behavior  maybe they are just not very well informed or they havent gotten
their first check for the interest rate compensation so i think its a little too soon to be certain about
how theyre going to behave going forward  you had one other question about the policy reason for
excluding the gses
mr madigan  theres not really a policy reason  i would say theres a legal reason
the statute allows us to pay interest only on balances held by depository institutions  my own view
is that it would be a good thing if we were able to pay interest to the gses exactly for the reasons
that weve been discussing  it might be something we could seek authority for at some point in the
future
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just a clarification  if we were to take that step are there any other
institutions that participate other than the gses
vice chairman geithner  chile mexico
mr madigan  we would have to look at that  i think there are more than just the three
gses that we usually think of  but theyre the biggest institutions that participate in the federal
funds market
mr dudley  it is not at all clear that their behavior is going to persist necessarily
because they may decide to manage their shortterm liquidity in a different way than selling at a
very low federal funds rate to banks
ms duke  mr chairman if i could
chairman bernanke  oh yes
ms duke  as part of my preparation when i talked to the banks i asked them specifically
this question about interest on reserves and every single one of them said we havent had time to
even focus on it  we dont even know whats going on with that  were not changing anything
theres so much going on right now  so i think were really going to have to wait until some of the
other decisionmaking has worked through before we can draw any conclusions as to what behavior
this might drive
chairman bernanke  learning theory in practice  thank you very much  very
helpful  all right  mr morin
mr morin3  thank you mr chairman  ill be using the packet with the green lettering on the cover entitled staff presentation on nonfinancial developments  over the intermeeting period the data we received on real activity were considerably weaker than we had been expecting  that combined with the intensification of financial turmoil since midseptember led us to significantly mark down our near term and mediumterm projections for economic activity
your first exhibit focuses on the nearterm outlook  as shown by the blue bars in the top left panel we currently expect real gdp to fall at an annual rate of slightly more than 1 percent on average in the second half of 2008a reduction of about
2 percentage points from our projection in the september greenbook the red bars one factor that has informed our thinking about the nearterm forecast is the labor market which looks weaker than at the time of the last fomc meeting  as you

3  the materials used by mr morin are appended to this transcript appendix 3
know payrolls fell steeply in september  since then initial claims for unemployment insurance the black line in the top right panel have been quite elevated even after adjusting for factors that are temporarily boosting claims the red line  as shown in the inset box the latest claims data point to another sizable drop in employment this month
turning to spending sales of light motor vehicles plotted in the middle left panel have been dismal of late and are expected to stay that way at least through the end of the year  motor vehicle sales have been depressed in part by financing constraints limited sales incentives a retreat by the automakers from leasing and worsening consumer assessments of carbuying conditions  more broadly as you can see by comparing the black and red lines in the panel to the right consumer spending excluding motor vehicles has been significantly softer in recent months than we were expecting  in addition the conditions influencing consumer outlays have worsened considerably including a sharp drop in household wealth tepid real income gains a weakening labor market picture historically low levels of sentiment and reduced credit availability  consequently as reported in the inset box we substantially revised down the projection for overall real pce in the second half of the year  in the housing sector singlefamily starts shown in the bottom left panel fell to about 550000 units in september6 percent below our expectation  even with the ongoing cutbacks in production the weak demand has left the months supply of unsold new homes not plotted very elevated and we expect starts to decline well into next year  in the business sector the spending data in hand are somewhat stale tomorrow morning we receive the advance reading on durable goods shipments and orders in septemberbut the information we do have points to softening business investment in the third quarter  moreover as shown on the right the first available surveys on business activity in october plunged to very low levels
exhibit 2 summarizes the enormous changes to the key conditioning factors that we confronted in putting together the staff forecast  as shown in the top left panel reflecting the recent plunge in equity prices the stock market path in this projection is markedly below the path anticipated in our september forecast  this downward revision together with the projected declines in house prices that bill bassett presented in his briefing leaves the level of the wealthtoincome ratio plotted to the right substantially lower than in the september greenbook  as a result over the next two years household wealth exerts a much greater drag on consumer spending than we assumed earlier  yields and spreads on corporate bonds illustrated by the baa rate in the middle left panel soared over the intermeeting period  we expect the higher cost of capital in this forecast to weigh on business capital spending over the projection period  a further drag on economic activity in the medium term is the recent jump in the exchange value of the dollar shown to the right  while we expect the dollar to decline a touch more quickly than in the september greenbook by the end of 2010 it remains more than 4 percent above the level assumed in our previous forecast  in addition as linda kole will discuss shortly the outlook for foreign activity has deteriorated  a partial cushion to these factors depressing activity is the plunge in oil prices over the past few weeks the bottom left panel shows the spot
price of west texas intermediate crude oil  the path for oil prices over the projection period based on futures quotes averages nearly 30 per barrel below the september greenbook path and should provide some countervailing support to household purchasing power and consumer spending  as noted to the right according to our standard forecasting models the lower level of equity prices the higher bond rates and the higher exchange value of the dollarall of which are intertwined with the intensification of financial turmoilexert a considerable drag on real activity over  the next two years  through conventional wealth costofcapital and termsoftrade channels alone these developments would lead us to revise down real gdp growth about 1 percentage points on average in 2009 and 2010  but these effects likely understate the full extent of the fallout on real activity from financial turmoil  this is because our standard models do not explicitly account for the additional effects of such factors as tighter lending standards and heightened uncertainty
consequently for some time we have been using supplementary analyses to try to account for these creditchannel effects in our judgmental projection  your next exhibit provides some detail on how we updated these adjustments in light of the intensification of financial stress during the intermeeting period  two measures that we have found useful for measuring the extent of financial turmoil are plotted in the top row of your third exhibit  on the left is an index of financial market stress and  on the right is an index of bank credit standards derived from the senior loan officer opinion survey  both indexes have skyrocketed lately reflecting the sharp deterioration of financial conditions  as discussed in the past two greenbooks we use two basic empirical approaches to try to quantify the effects of financial turmoil on real activity that are not captured by our standard models  one is based on the historical correlations between these financial turmoil measures and errors in frbus spending equations and the second method incorporates these indicators of turmoil into smallscale vector autoregressions
the middle left panel shows estimates of the cumulative effect of our judgmental adjustments for financial turmoil outside the conventional channels noted earlier
the effects are shown relative to the level of real gdp in the fourth quarter of each year  the solid black line is the judgmental estimate built into the current greenbook forecast whereas the red dashed line plots the estimates used in the september projection  the shaded area shows the range of results from the modelbased estimates detailed in part 1 of the october greenbook  as you can see by comparing the black and red lines we now expect that financial turmoil outside the usual channels will impose a markedly greater drag on real activity than we projected in the last greenbook  for 2008 we think that much of the unexpected weakness observed recently in the spending data reflects financial turmoil effects which puts our judgmental adjustment near the bottom of the modelbased range  in contrast our adjustment for 2009 is in the middle of the range of modelbased results whereas for 2010 our adjustment is near the top end of the range  we are more optimistic than the models for 2010 in part because none of the modelbased estimates fully accounts for what we assume will be the likely restorative effects over time of the actions taken by governments to mitigate the problems afflicting the financial system  as shown in
the middle right panel these restraining influences taken together led us to mark down our assumed path for the federal funds rate  we now assume that the funds rate is lowered to  percent by early next year and is held at that level until mid2010
although the path for the funds rate is appreciably lower than we had assumed in the september greenbook the additional monetary easing only partially offsets the greater restraint on activity from the other factors shaping the projection  all told as shown in the first line of the table at the bottom of the page we project that real gdp will fall at an annual rate of nearly 1 percent in the first half of 2009 and then turn up modestly in the second half  in 2010with the drag on activity from the strains in financial markets beginning to ease housing market conditions stabilizing and an accommodative monetary policy in placeactivity accelerates further and real gdp increases 23 percent over the four quarters of the year  the contributions of selected domestic spending categories to changes in real gdp are shown in lines 3 to 5  as you can see we think that consumption will begin to recover next year and that the drag from housing will diminish over time  in contrast we expect business fixed investment to remain quite weak next year reflecting in part the lagged effects on investment of declining business output the high cost of capital and heightened uncertainty  although each of the major components of private domestic demand contributes to the acceleration in economic activity in 2010 the contribution to growth from net exports line 6 is expected to turn slightly negative late next year
as shown in the top panels of exhibit 4 the margin of slack both in labor markets the panel to the left and in the industrial sector the panel to the right is expected to remain substantial through the end of the projection period  we expect this persistent slack to be a source of downward pressure on inflation  other influences are also likely to hold down inflation over the projection period  as shown in the middle panels energy prices and core goods import prices decelerate sharply from their recent elevated paces  the projected path for consumer energy prices the left panel largely reflects the effect of the intermeeting plunge in oil prices and the forecast for core import prices the right panel reflects both the sharp drop in commodity prices and the stronger dollar  as shown in the bottom left panel while the michigan  survey readings on nearterm inflation expectations have remained elevated the black line those on longerterm inflation the red line have more than retraced the runup observed earlier this year  taken together as shown in line 7 of the bottom right panel we now expect core pce inflation to move down to 1 percent in 2009 and to slow further to 1 percent in 2010 roughly  percentage point less in each year than projected previously  total pce inflation line 1 is projected to run at about the same rate as core pce inflation in both years
turning to exhibit 5 a critical feature of the staff forecast is our assumption that the strains in financial markets will ease gradually over the next two years  however the current situation is so extraordinary in terms of both the financial disruptions and the policy responses to those disruptions that an extremely wide band of uncertainty surrounds this assumption  matters could easily turn out much worse or much better
to give some sense of possible magnitudes this exhibit reviews two alternative scenarios from the greenbook
in the first scenario outlined in the top left panel financial turmoil intensifies further over the projection period rather than gradually abating and the accompanying economic fallout turns out to be more severe than in the baseline projection  specifically risk premiums on loans corporate bonds and equity jump a further 50 basis points and are slower to fall back over time in addition the level of house prices falls an additional 10 percent relative to the baseline  we also assume that creditchannel and other nonconventional effects are even more restrictive in 2009 and 2010 than those built into the staff forecastto a degree more in line with the bottom end of the range of empirical estimates i presented earlier  as shown by the red line in the middle left panel with the intensification of the financial turmoil and the larger judgmental adjustments for the impact of financial stress on economic activity real gdp is significantly weaker than in the baseline the black line  as a result the unemployment rate plotted to the right rises faster and farther peaking at nearly 8 percent at the end of 2010 more than 1 percentage point above the baseline  reflecting the greater accompanying slack core pce inflation shown in the bottom left panel moves down appreciably faster than in the baseline reaching just  percent at the end of 2010  with substantial slack and a low and falling inflation rate the funds rate remains pinned through 2010 at  percent and continues at that level through 2012 in the extended simulation presented in the greenbook
in the second scenario outlined in the top right panel the stress weighing on financial institutions and markets lifts much more quickly than in the baseline perhaps in response to the extraordinary recent government actions  here we assume that risk spreads recede by early next year to the levels that were projected in the september greenbook and as a result equities reverse most of their recent losses by the middle of next year  in addition we cut back the size of the judgmental adjustments for financial turmoil to their september greenbook levels  as shown by the blue lines in the middle panels economic activity responds fairly vigorously to the improvement in financial conditions with gdp growth reaching about 4 percent by the end of 2010 and the unemployment rate moving down to 5 percent  as shown in the bottom left panel the narrower margin of slack in the alternative scenario tempers the decline in core pce inflation relative to baseline  finally as shown to the right the federal funds rate under an optimal control monetary policy declines briefly to 1 percent early next year but then moves up steadily as it becomes clear that the financial strains are lifting rapidly  linda kole will now continue our presentation
ms kole4  im referring to the next exhibits that are attached to the material you are already looking at  since the september fomc meeting financial market distress has intensified and has spread around the world threatening many emerging market economies that previously had been less affected by the us and european credit crisis  as shown in the top left panel equity prices have fallen sharply in europe

japan and the united kingdom  indeed the nikkei is at a 26year low today  the carnage has been just as pronounced in emerging markets shown on the right  credit spreads between industrial countries risky corporates and government bonds plotted in the middle left panel soared especially in the euro area and as shown in the right panel credit default swap premiums on sovereign debt in many emerging market economies have skyrocketed  the widespread pullback from risk led to safehaven flows into dollar assets as shown in the bottom left panel the dollar appreciated nearly 11 percent against the major currencies the black line despite a 9 percent depreciation against the yen the red line as carry trades were unwound  the dollar strengthened 9 percent against the currencies of our other important trading partners as shown on the right effective exchange values of the currencies of brazil mexico and korea were particularly hard hit
in your next exhibit the top left panel shows the extent to which investors fleeing risk have been liquidating emerging market equity funds  several foreign governments notably russias have fought related currency pressures by drawing down their reserves the top right panel  for instance since the peso fell sharply against the dollar in early october the bank of mexico has deployed 15 percent of its reserves to shore up its value  china and russia have even intervened to stem the fall in their equity prices  following the collapse of lehman brothers credit markets seized up and dollar funding needs intensified  since then governments around the world have taken several steps to support their banking systems the middle panel
some central banks have injected massive amounts of liquidity and many have cut policy rates or reserve requirements or both  in addition to the countries joining the fed in a coordinated 50 basis point rate cut on october 8 a wide range of other economies have eased policy lately  note that there have been a few exceptions hungary iceland and denmark increased rates to counter currency pressures
governments have also expanded bank deposit insurance and guaranteed new bank lending in order to improve confidence and liquidity  following a similar initiative in the united kingdom euroarea governments announced plans to guarantee the issuance of new mediumterm senior debt by banks and to directly assist their recapitalization if necessary  in recent weeks authorities have announced capital injections into a number of banks whose financial soundness was in question  the swap lines extended by the federal reserve to foreign central banks have been expanded  the ecb approved a 5 billion swap line for hungary and a 12 billion one for denmark and several asian countries are currently negotiating swap lines with each other as well  private firms in several emerging market economies have confronted pressures in rolling over foreign currency funding and authorities there have also raised deposit guarantees guaranteed bank lending and injected capital into vulnerable banks  finally several countries have applied to the imf for assistance
the bottom left panel shows median credit default swap premiums for banks in europe the united kingdom and the united states  the declines since the beginning of this month suggest that the announcement of these plans has improved confidence in banks safety even if they have not restored confidence in broader economic prospects  as shown by the implied ois forward rates in the bottom middle panel
market participants expect considerably more monetary policy easing in europe than they did at the time of the last fomc meeting  we assume that further cuts in official rates shown on the right will be forthcoming as output falls short of potential and inflation recedes
as can be seen in exhibit 3 highly stressed global financial conditions and the weaker us outlook have led us to take a whack out of our outlook for foreign growth  comparing lines 1 and 2 we have marked down our estimate of total foreign growth for the third quarter more than 1 percentage point and we have slashed our forecast even more for q4 and 2009  we project outright recessions in the advanced foreign economies lines 3 through 7 and in mexico line 12  in other emerging economies we foresee growth rates well below potential  chinese real gdp growth line 10 is estimated to have slowed considerably in the third quarter  we expect some payback in q4 but beyond that we have revised down our outlook  as can be seen in the middle left panel exports fell in august in many of our largest trading partners though they still chugged along in china through september  the black line in the middle panel shows that the volume of exports from canada has been falling for some time but exports had held up in japan and germany until the third quarter when they fell  industrial production in japan the red line in the middle right panel has fallen nearly 5 percent below its yearago level and ip has also fallen over the past year in the united kingdom and the euro area  as global demand has slumped oil prices the black line in the bottom left panel have plummeted and nonfuel commodity prices have fallen as well  the decline in commodity prices along with slackening economic activity is projected to help bring down inflation in all of the regions shown on the right
exhibit 4 focuses on the outlook for europe  banks remain leery of lending to each other as evidenced by the growing amount of funds parked at the ecbs deposit facility  the latest boe bank lending survey the top right panel pointed to further tightening of uk lending standards in the third quarter and suggested that banks expected to tighten them somewhat further in the fourth quarter the striped bars
notably this survey was taken before lehman failed  a confidential conversation with a contact at the boe who had talked with a few bankers more recently suggested that the latest survey considerably underestimated the recent tightening of standards the quarterly growth of uk loans to nonfinancial corporations the red line in the middle left panel fell from doubledigit paces for the past two years to 5 percent in the third quarter  credit expansion to households the dashed line declined as well loan growth in the euro area the middle panel also slowed  europe has clearly moved into recession  the middle right panel shows that house prices have fallen over the past year in the united kingdom and ireland and have also slowed in other european locales  but it is not just the property sector that has slumped  business confidence the bottom left has disintegrated  total economy purchasing managers indexes the middle panel are in the downturn range in both the united kingdom and the euro area  unemployment rates have increased especially in france and spain where construction activity has slowed sharply
your next exhibit takes a quick tour through the rest of the world  in japan business confidence the red line has plunged partly because lending terms faced by firms particularly small and mediumsized enterprises have become more restrictive investment intentions not shown have deteriorated as shipments the black line and exports have declined  the labor market has deteriorated with the ratio of job offers to applicants in blue falling to its lowest level in the past four years  the bank of japan recently downgraded its outlook and stepped up measures to deal with financial market stresses  in china investment spending the black dashed line in the top right panel continued to be strong through september and retail sales accelerated
however industrial production middle left panel slowed this summer partly because of efforts to reduce pollution in beijing during the august olympics but also because of declining steel production suggesting further slowing  industrial production has also slowed in korea and taiwan and export orders shown on the right are falling in china brazil and singapore  as shown in the bottom left panel mexico has suffered a steep fall in remittances flattening industrial production and declining auto exports  oil revenues not shown are down as well  finally global pmi and new orders indexes which aggregate data for 26 major countries are both in contractionary territory but have not yet reached their depths at the trough of the 2001 recession
exhibit 6 reviews the main elements of the us external outlook  as shown in line 1 of the top panel net exports contributed 18 percentage points to growth in the first half of this year but we expect this contribution to drop off considerably in coming quarters as exports line 3 slow with foreign growth and imports line 5 remain flat  total foreign growth the black line in the middle left panel is now projected to dip down about as much as us growth while the dollar shown on the right is well above the level we projected in the september greenbook  as shown in line 3 of the table we now expect export growth to move down sharply starting in the current quarter and to remain well below what wed written down in our last forecast although lower us demand caused us to lower import growth line 5 the projected contribution of net exports to gdp growth has on net been revised down a bit over the forecast period  the bottom panel gives a longer perspective on us external deficits  the nonoil trade deficit the dashed orange line and current account deficit the red line have continued to narrow over the past year and a half although oil imports have remained large  the current account deficit to gdp ratio is forecast to fall below 3 percent in 2010 a level last reached in 1998  brian madigan will continue with our presentation
mr madigan5  i will be referring to the separate package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections  exhibit 1 shows the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008 corresponding information about the committees most recent projections those from june is shown in italics and greenbook projections are included as a memo item  your june projections regarding gdp growth and inflation for the first half of 2008 turned out to be quite close to subsequent bea data releases therefore the revisions in your

5  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 5
projections for the year as a whole are almost entirely due to the changes in your implicit projections for the second half of 2008
as shown in the right column of the top panel your gdp growth forecasts for 2008h2 now range from minus 2 percent to minus  percent compared with june each of you has marked down your projection for secondhalf growth by at least
2 percentage points  as shown in the second panel your forecasts of the fourth quarter average unemployment rate fall in a range of 63 to 66 percent more than
 percentage point higher than in june  in accounting for the sharp deterioration in the nearterm outlook for activity your narratives point to the intensification of the financial crisis and its impact on credit conditions and stock market wealth as well as the weakness of incoming data on consumer spending and labor market conditions
your assessments of inflation in 2008 have also shifted significantly since june the central tendency of your forecasts for overall pce inflation during 2008h2 the right column of the third panel is now about 1 to 2 percent a drop of about
2 percentage points from june  in this regard a number of you noted the implications of recent sharp declines in energy and commodity prices that were apparently triggered by the worldwide slowdown in economic activity  in contrast your projections for core pce inflation in 2008h2 the right column of the bottom panel are a notch higher than in june
exhibit 2 reports your projections for the next three calendar years  most of you anticipate little or no gdp growth during 2009 as with your implicit forecasts for the second half of 2008 these projections are about 2 percentage points lower than in june  a few of you are projecting even weaker outcomes with output declining about 1 percent whereas a few others are projecting stronger economic growth of about 1 to 1 percent  the width of both the ranges and the central tendencies of your projections for real gdp growth for 2009 and 2010 has increased noticeably
still all of you anticipate that economic expansion will resume by 2010 and most of you expect a further pickup in growth during 2011  in the narratives accompanying these projections a number of you said that you expect the pace of recovery to be damped by persistent credit market strains ongoing adjustment in the housing market and economic weakness abroad  apparently only a few of you assumed that additional fiscal stimulus would be enacted
most of you project that the unemployment rate will peak at around 7 to
7 percent in 2009 and decline gradually over the subsequent two years  however you generally expect that even by the end of 2011 the unemployment rate will still be at or above 5 percent  moreover most of you anticipate that the unemployment rate in 2011 will remain well above your own projections of the longerrun unemployment rate that were provided in your trialrun submissions
the central tendency of your projections for overall pce inflation is about 1 to 2 percent for 2009 and about 1 to 1 percent for 2010 and 2011roughly the same as for your forecasts of core pce inflation  about half of you projected inflation
rates in 2011 close or identical to your own individual assessments of the rate of inflation consistent with federal reserves dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum employment where we have again judged the latter from your longer term trialrun submissions  but half of you are projecting that inflation in 2011 will be below your own individual assessments of the mandateconsistent inflation rate by about  to  percentage point and in one case by more than 1 percentage point mainly reflecting the lagged effects of weak economic activity and the relatively sluggish pace of recovery
in your forecast submissions several of you indicated that the appropriate path of monetary policy would involve less nearterm easing than assumed in the greenbook and more than half of you expressed the view that policy tightening would need to occur several quarters earlier and at a substantially more rapid pace than in the greenbook
exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  as shown in the top lefthand panel all of you now see uncertainty about growth as elevated relative to historical norms  as shown to the right most of you continue to perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside even with the downward revision in your modal projections  several of you pointed to the possibility that financial market turmoil might not subside as quickly as anticipated and to significant risks of an increasingly negative feedback loop between credit markets and economic activity  as shown in the bottom lefthand panel most of you also continue to see an elevated degree of uncertainty about inflation  in june most of you judged the risks to the inflation outlook as skewed to the upside but as shown to the right nearly all of you now see the risks to the inflation outlook as either balanced or tilted to the downside
exhibit 4 summarizes the results of the trial run on longerterm projections  these projections were intended to represent values to which variables would converge over time say five to six years ahead under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of any further shocks  for real gdp growth your longerterm projections have a central tendency of 2 to 2 percent and a range of about 2 to 3 percent  for the unemployment rate your longerrun projections have a central tendency of 4 to 5 percent and a range of about 4 to 5 percent  for both variables the central tendencies are very similar to those of the projections for 2010 that you made in october 2007 shown in the bottom panel a point at which many of you viewed the modal outlook for 2010 as being fairly close to the balanced growth path of the economy  for pce inflation your longerrun projections have a central tendency of about 1 percent and a range of 1 to 2 percent  the range of these projections is identical to the range of twoyearahead inflation projections that you made last october the minutes from that meeting indicated that those projections were influenced importantly by your judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum employment
the request for the trialrun projections suggested that convergence might typically occur over a period of five to six years  one of you noted that the convergence process this time will likely occur over an even longer period because of the severity of the economic crisis  however apparently most of you thought that convergence would occur sooner than that suggesting that the configuration of this trial run produces a good representation of fomc participants views of the steady state values of gdp growth unemployment and inflation
as usual the staff will be preparing a summary of economic projections sep and will be circulating drafts to you over the next few weeks along with drafts of the minutes  the published sep and hence the drafts will not incorporate the longer term projections from the trial run  the staff will provide to you separately a version of the sep that has been modified to incorporate the longerterm projections generated by the trial run  the subcommittee will consult with the chairman about next steps  one possibility would be for the committee to discuss experience with the trial run at its december meeting and make a provisional decision at that time as to whether to proceed in january with regular longerterm projections a final decision could be made in january  thank you  that concludes our presentation
chairman bernanke  thank you  before we go too long well take a coffee break
but now lets take some questions  president lacker
mr lacker  in the forecast the federal funds rate goes to 50 basis points and i take it
thats essentially as low as you think it can go  you treat that as sort of the lower bound on nominal
interest rates  is that right
mr stockton  thats how we were thinking of it  the 50 basis points however was
not done on the basis of any deep analytical analysis of whether that in fact is the zero bound and i
think thats an issue that the staff will need to address pronto  but the message in the forecast with
that funds rate path was that we think this shock is large enough that you will need to lower the
funds rate as low as you think it can feasibly go
mr lacker  well whatever that lower bound is i have a question thats kind of
hypothetical  i wasnt a member of the committee five years ago  my understanding though is
that much thought was given to how we would conduct monetary policy if we needed to reduce the
nominal federal funds rate to zero or its effective equivalent  my understanding is that the general
conclusionand my understanding is that this is mainstream economists general view as wellis
that the way we would do that would be to expand the monetary base perhaps by buying assets
outside the normal range of assets that we would buy  now the first question is is that correct
then i have a followup
chairman bernanke  may i  you can answer but let me just make a suggestion
which is that there were a number of memos and studies done in 2003  i think we ought to look at
them update them and circulate them fairly soon  so well do this in some detail but by all means
lets hear the answer
mr madigan  president lacker i would say that there are a number of strategies that
the committee could think about if it were at the point that it felt it couldnt lower the federal funds
rate any further be that zero or some higher level  one would be communications that suggest to
market participants a willingness to hold shortterm rates at very low levels for a very long period of
time  of course one could view the 2003 experience as implementing that strategy with the
considerable period language  but obviously the idea is to try to hold down the longerterm rates
that matter for spending to a larger degree than might be implied by market participants views that
you might instead begin to firm monetary policy sooner
there are a number of other possibilities  as you suggest one would be simply to expand
the federal reserves balance sheet furtherengage in a sort of quantitative easing  the
effectiveness of that could be debated  another possibility that was discussed at least in the period
in which the studies were done would be to change the composition of the federal reserves
balance sheet  of course weve already done a lot of that with the various lending facilities and so
the scope for additional expansion there would need to be thought through
mr lacker  the reason i ask is that my understanding is that the strategy of expanding
the monetary base would work through increasing inflation or reducing deflation
mr madigan  thats not how i would think about it  i would think about it as giving if
it works depository institutions increased incentives to expand their lending by providing them with
a great deal more funding than they actually need and thereby increasing spending propensities  i
would see this more as part of a package of various ways to stimulate spending by reducing real
interest rates but not as something that would feed through directly to inflation  rather this would
more properly be viewed at least in the way i think about things as fighting deflation rather than
trying to cause a higher positive rate of inflation
mr lacker  my understanding is that economists such as woodford and others who
have studied this believe that by using monetary assets to purchase other assets we can make the
price level and thus the inflation rate higher than it otherwise would be  is that a fair understanding
chairman bernanke  i dont think thats right  i think the thrust of the elementary
approach to quantitative easing is the old milton friedman ideathat changing the composition of
money and other assets changes relative returns  so its a way to bring down returns on other assets
and create stimulus even if the policy rate is down to zero
mr lacker  the mechanism friedman sketched ultimately produces a proportionate
increase in the price level doesnt it
chairman bernanke  eventually but through the aggregate demand mechanism
mr lacker  right
chairman bernanke  we should look at the woodford thing but i dont think thats
quite the right characterization of his view
mr lacker  well the reason i ask all of this is that with an interest rate on reserves
above zero thats effectively equivalent to a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates  so we are
effectively doing this quantitative easing
chairman bernanke  were pretty close yes
mr lacker  right  so the thought that sparks is that if the mechanism involves
creating inflation then id wonder what checks we have on the scale of open market operations now
to ensure that were not by expanding our balance sheet as much as we have risking an increase in
inflation
chairman bernanke  i dont think thats the right characterization but id be happy
to talk about it off line  president plosser
mr plosser  i have a question  as you characterized the forecast in the greenbook it is
really the result of very large adjustments to the financial constraints piecein fact theyre about
double what they were in the september greenbookand those adjustments or factors really
account for a large portion maybe not all of the downward revision in the forecast  now one of
the inputs in the financial factors are spreads of various kinds in the vars that you used to estimate
those  but those spreads weve learned are very very volatile  they can rise very quickly as weve
seen  they also can fall very quickly sometimes  spreads have actually come down a little in the
last few days which is the good news  if our facilities are successful they actually may fall
furtherknock on wood that would be very nice  but i get a little nervous making our forecast be
driven so much by something thats potentially very very volatile
now we get a bit of a picture of thisand i want to applaud the staffin i guess it was
exhibit 5 where you were comparing the baseline forecast and the two alternative scenarios
particularly the one in which you get quicker recovery in the financial sector  i thought that was a
very useful exercise and i really appreciate it  my interpretation or intuition is that the more rapid
financial recovery scenario is what the forecast would look like had we not done the additional add
factors in october and instead held them to what they were in september  that suggests that the
real data whether on spending or other things have driven the forecast down a little but not a
whole lot  in fact in that scenario you imply that the funds rate would actually be held constant at
1 percent  so in looking at those two scenarios and trying to parse out how much risk or how
much probability to attach to them what is the staffs view  obviously heres what you thought the
baseline would be but if i ask you what you think the probabilities are on some of these different
scenariosin particular im interested in this sort of faster recoverydo you have any sense of
what the probabilities of these two different outcomes might be and how one might think about
that  they imply very different paths for the funds rate and very different forecast profiles but their
differences depend on variables that are very very volatile  so can you give me some probabilities
of how you think about those two scenarios
mr stockton  i can give you some probabilities but i dont know how seriously
you should take them  laughter
mr plosser  you can give me a distribution
mr stockton  what we wanted to convey in the alternative scenarios that we
showed this timeand we reduced the number because we thought the possible little risks that
you might be facing were being swamped by some really big oneswas our sense that the
likelihood function is pretty flat around the baseline and the two alternative scenarios that we
show here in exhibit 5  i share your discomfort  as i was telling president evans at lunch today
i feel a bit as though the forecast is going to depend a lot on when the clock stopped given how
much volatility there has been in the stock market and in corporate spreads  when the clock
stopped we had close to a 25 percent weaker level on the stock market 200 basis points higher
on the baa spread and a 7 percent higher dollar  there were a whole lot of negative forces
operating on this forecast  indeed both the conventional wealth effect and costofcapital
channels account for about onethird of the downward revision we made  the special
nonconventional credit channel effects account for a third and a third of the downward revision
really is a combination of the stronger dollar and the weaker foreign outlook
the part that i feel most comfortable with in this forecast is that there has been a very
significant negative shock to the economy and that it is difficult to imagine that activity will not
be affected importantly by that  the part that i feel most uncertain aboutand as you point out
is relevant to the policy decisions that you are going to make over the next several meetingsis
that i have no idea about the timing or the manner in which this will fade away  so we have it
fading away gradually over the next two years  i think that a more rapid recovery is certainly a
possibility  as you noted even that scenario doesnt go back to where we were in september
one the incoming data suggest that the underlying economy is starting out at a weaker place
and even if conditions were to improve very rapidly over the next quarter or two you have still
sustained a hit that is going to take some time to play out through the system  by the same
token i dont think that you can discount the more extended and deeper financial fallout here
we have certainly been surprised over the past year in many ways by just how virulent and
persistent this shock has been  two looking at the current state of aggregate demand and
aggregate activity i think we are probably still just at the front edge of the credit constraint
effects on actual spending  so you could still be faced with some very substantial restraint on
spendingand more than we have built into the baseline forecast
so and as you noted the difference in the policy prescriptions therethe worse scenario
is that the funds rate stays as low as it can stay for several years  the other would beputting
too fine a point on itthat optimal control even with the more rapid recovery goes down to
1 percent on the funds rate and then starts recovering to 1 percent  but that is obviously a very
different policy picture  i just dont think that at this point science is going to allow us to put a
lot of probability mass on one of those scenarios versus the other two
mr morin  one quick followon comment  in exhibit 3 in the middle left panel if
you look at our financial turmoil effects with the gray shading the bulk of the markdown in
2008 actually is what were labeling the financial turmoil  but those are data we pretty much
already have in hand  we are calling much of the shortfall in consumption that we expect to see
in the third quarter as financial turmoil  so much of the weakness in the second half of this
year isnt just taking a flyer on what we think turmoil is going to do some of it is already in the
data
mr plosser  i was looking at the table in the greenbook at the bottom  thats
where i was trying to back out some of this  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  i have a question and a statement disguised as a question
chairman bernanke  not anymore  laughter
mr fisher  a quick question on fiscal policy both domestic and international  being
struck ms kole by your verbs whacked and disintegratedvery forceful languagewhat
are your assumptions about fiscal policy in terms of staff projections first for the domestic
economy and second for other economies  thats the question part
mr morin  right now although the odds are that there will be a fiscal package next
year it is not a feature of the baseline forecast  we discussed two alternative simulations for
different packages but additional fiscal stimulus is not a feature of the baseline
mr stockton  we made a deliberate decision in constructing the forecast given the
enormous uncertainty about both the size and the composition of those fiscal packages  we had
so many moving parts in our baseline forecast that we wanted to present you with that and then
show you what the consequences might be first of a stimulus package that looks a lot like the
one we had this yearwhich we think probably gave a shock but a very shortlived shock to
aggregate demand and then faded away  that doesnt really have many important consequences
for the outlook  the second was a much larger package that delivered some stimulus over the
next two years  that had a bit of an effect in terms of raising gdp growth and lowering the
unemployment rate  but even that 300 billion fiscal package wasnt enough in our baseline
forecast to lift the funds rate assumption off the floor  so i think one of the messages would be
that to have a fiscal package that would actually influence your current policy discussion you
have to think both that it would be extremely large and that it would deliver stimulus over an
extended period of time to be effective that way
ms kole  i think that in many of the major foreign countries there is room for fiscal
stimulus  that may be a bit of an upside risk to our forecast because for example china has
already put some things in place  they have increased exporter rebates and they are also putting
more money into homebuilding and trying to prop up the construction industry  japan just
announced a bigger package  im not so sure if it will go through  korea has announcedand
even some of the oil producers are announcingplans to put money into the system  i dont
think we have fully incorporated that  maybe we have thought about it in chinas case because
we think that they will do everything they need to do to keep that economy growing at a
mr fisher  so its possible that we might have marginally higher rates of growth
than
ms kole  right  i think that the united kingdom too is expanding fiscal policy
europe hasnt really announced much yet but perhaps they will do more as well
mr fisher  the second thing goes back to this business of the judgmental effects of
financial market turmoil  do you have any concern that the financial turmoil may have reduced
the marginal effectiveness of changes in the funds rate  in other words if you think in my
simple way of a patient on the operating table we have an iv tube into them we titrate the fed
funds ratewe have been cutting ratesbut the tube has been crimped  the flow i would
suggest may not be as full as it would have been before  is it possible that we havent felt the
full effects or all things being equal we havent felt the same effects that we would have felt if
the pipes hadnt been crimped  im curious as to your view on that
mr stockton  the answer to that is yesit is certainly possible  obviously it is
very difficult to separate things that might actually have changed the transmission channel of
monetary policy from just big financial developments that have offset the beneficial effects of
easing policy  we built an assumption into the baseline forecast that gdp responds close to the
average response to a fed funds rate reduction as would normally be the case  the one small
technical area in which it seems as though the effect almost certainly would be smaller is that
with the equity premium so high right now any given change in the funds rate is likely to result
in a smaller change in the required return on equity and probably a smaller stock market response
than you would normally get  so i think basically it is certainly possible but in our forecast we
have assumed that the additional reductions will have gdp consequences along the lines of the
normal response
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we take fifteen minutes for coffee and
then well do part of the goround  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  well why dont we turn part of our dinner period to the go
round  lets start with president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  most of the anecdotal information from
the sixth district is consistent with the downbeat picture that has been emerging in the national
data  the sentiment of directors and their contacts has turned decidedly more pessimistic
regarding current economic conditions and the nearterm outlook  banking contacts indicate a
further tightening of credit standards while stresses on household and small business finances
have resulted in increased credit card usage  a state economicdevelopment official noted that
some banks have halted their 9010 sba lending  bankers active in the vrdn variable rate
demand note market noted that municipalities are under pressure with declining revenues and
higher financing costs  nonresidential building contractors noted a large increase in the number
of canceled projects  advisory council members described a substantial decline in domestic
shipping and transport activity for most goods other than energy products and some slowing of
export volumes through regional ports  finally retail contacts in anticipation of the coming
holiday season noted that orders are down and heavy price discounting has begun already
thematically atlantas forecast is consistent with the greenbook but we are projecting a
slightly more severe and protracted downturn in business activity than the greenbook baseline
my assumption is that the cascading dynamic at work in the financial markets may take longer
than projected in the greenbook to come to an end  as a consequence i view the greenbooks
scenario entitled more financial fallout as the most plausible storyline among the likely range
of outcomes  i should acknowledge that were in an interval between the announcement of the
tarp and its full implementation  the encouraging improvement in credit spreads and term
funding we have seen in recent days may accelerate once the tarp is operational
with inflation abating more or less as expected and with such uncertainty surrounding the
playing out of continuing and recently worsening turmoil in the financial markets i have to view
the balance of risks as more negative for growth than upside for inflation  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i think it is clear that inflation has been rolled over by the
steamroller of the credit crisis  i am not going to belabor what i have heard from the ceos i
have spoken to  basically the best summary is that things have gone from interesting to
unbelievable  we have had an implosion of economic activity  business women and men not
having any pricing power are doing what you would expect them to do  they are cutting their
costs of goods sold which means they are shedding head count dramatically  they are
stretching out their roi assumptions and they are cutting back on capex and basically
assuming procyclical behavior on the downside  i doubt that any of us are going to report
anything different particularly since i think i am in a district that relatively speaking is still
strong  i would hope that during our discussions today we would each take the time or at least
ask for some response  i would like some response from you in particular  the situation is dire
there is no question about that  we are in dire straits  there is no inflationary tail or if there is
it is completely flattened in terms of the foreseeable future  the risks are to the downside on
economic growth
a question i have is what do we do next  actually i should address the issue of what
we do first  i dont think doing dribbles and drabs is an answer  i think we just do nothingand
i could make that case because weve done an awful lotor we do something that is a firm
statement  but in response to that statement the question has to be what do we do as next
steps  im particularly curious about whether or not we address during this meeting and tonight
and tomorrow not only next steps but what the end game is  where do we want to be  how
long are we going to be there and eventually how do we exit  but that is of course the
ultimate question that i think we can delay  so mr chairman id like to suggest that we not go
through our standard ritual of reading about our districts and so on because i dont think there is
going to be a whole lot of difference  the real question is what do we do about it and whats
the cognitive road map from here  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  well i for one will certainly give my response to that at the
appropriate time and we need to hear from everybody  but everyone is obviously free to talk
about whatever they want to talk about  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  in the runup to halloween we have had a
witchs brew of news  sorry  laughter  the downward trajectory of economic data has been
hairraisingwith employment consumer sentiment spending and orders for capital goods and
homebuilding all contractingand conditions in financial and credit markets have taken a
ghastly turn for the worse  it is becoming abundantly clear that we are in the midst of a serious
global meltdown  like the board staff i have slashed my forecast for economic activity and
now foresee a recession with four straight quarters of negative growth starting last quarter  i
wish that i could claim that i place a lot of confidence in the sobering forecast but i am sorry to
say i cant  in fact i think we will be lucky if the adverse feedback loop that is under way
doesnt wrench us into a much more pronounced and more protracted downturn  the outlook for
inflation has shifted markedly too with the days of heightened upside inflation risks behind us
in fact i am concerned that beyond next year we run the risk of inflation falling below the level
consistent with price stability
even before the extraordinary deterioration in financial market conditions over the past
few weeks there were numerous signs that the economy had weakened dramatically  i wont
recite the litany of disappointing data but instead try to touch upon some high or i guess i should
say low notes based on what my contacts tell me  they are consistent with president fishers
observations  consumer purchases of durable goods especially motor vehicles have been
particularly hard hit by the onetwo punch of tight credit and reeling consumer confidence  the
mood on showroom floors is downright grim  one auto dealer in my district reports that he is
now experiencing the worst period in his thirtyplus years in the business  a home appliance
retailer adds that he has never seen more uncertainty and gloom from both the retailers and the
vendors  this sentiment is echoed by a large retailer who says simply the holiday shopping
season is going to stink
businesses are under siege from weak demand high costs of borrowing curtailed credit
availability and pervasive uncertainty about how long such conditions will last  our contacts
report that bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate  many have become more cautious
in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending projects that can be deferred  they
are even cutting back trade credit to customers  even firms that are currently in good shape
report that they are hunkering down cutting back on all but essential spending and preparing for
the worst  our venture capital and private equity contacts tell us that they are instructing their
portfolio companies to cut costs put expansion plans on hold and draw down existing credit
lines  the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities has all but dried up and lenders
have also become less willing to extend funding  with financing unavailable i am hearing talk
about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned improvements on existing buildings as
well as the potential for distress sales of properties whose owners will be unable to roll over debt
as it matures  the deterioration in overall financial conditions since the september fomc
meeting is truly shocking  even with todays 900point increase in the dow broad indexes are
still down about 20 percent and the latest data suggest house prices in a freefall  baa corporate
bonds are up about 200 basis points since our last meeting lowgrade corporate bonds are up a
staggering 700 basis points and to top it all the dollar has appreciated nearly 10 percent against
the currencies of our trading partners  the sharp deterioration in financial and credit conditions
will weigh heavily on economic activity for some time  in addition prospects for the one
remaining cylinder in the engine of growthnamely net exportsare bleak owing to the
slowdown in global demand and the appreciation of the dollar
we now expect real gdp to decline at an annual rate of 1 percent in the second half of
this year and to register two more negative quarters in the first half of next year  that forecast is
predicated on cutting the funds rate to  percent by january as assumed in the greenbook and
also is premised on another fiscal package  an absolutely critical precondition for the economy
to recover next year is for the financial system to get back on its feet  in that regard i have been
greatly heartened by the important actions that the treasury the fdic the fed foreign
governments and other central banks have taken in recent weeks to improve liquidity and inject
capital into the financial systems  but we are fighting an uphill battle against falling home
prices an economy in recession and collapsing confidence  it is not clear whether these steps
will reopen credit flows to households and businesses especially those with less than sterling
credit  under the greenbook forecast we will see further large declines in housing prices over
the next two years  banks and other financial institutions will likely suffer larger losses than
many had anticipated and that will mute the impact of recent capital injections  the interaction
of higher unemployment and rising delinquencies raises the potential for even greater losses by
banks and other financial institutions and for an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we
have worried about and are now experiencing  such a sequence of events plausibly could lead to
outcomes described in the more financial fallout alternative scenario in the greenbook
there are considerable downside risks to the nearterm outlook as well  as i mentioned
the most recent economic data have consistently surprised on the downside and i see a real risk
that the data may continue to come in weaker in the near term than the greenbook has assumed
for example a dynamic factor model that my staff regularly uses is much more pessimistic in
the near term than is the greenbook  this model aggregates the information contained in more
than 140 data series  based on the most recent economic and financial data available this model
predicts that real gdp will fall 2 percent in the fourth quarter  the models pessimism reflects
the combination of the recent weak data releases for the month of september followed by the
abysmal data that we have available so far for october including financial market prices
regional business surveys and consumer sentiment
turning to inflation the most recent data have been encouraging  looking forward the
sharp decline in commodity prices especially oil prices will bring headline inflation down
relatively quickly  more fundamentally the considerable slack in labor and product markets will
put downward pressure on the underlying rate of inflation over the next few years  a number of
my contacts already report that their businesses are working on lower margins in the more
challenging economic environment  i expect headline pce price inflation to decline to about
1 percent in 2009 and core pce price inflation to be 1 percent next year  i expect both
inflation rates to edge down to 1 percent in 2010  given the sizable downside risk to the
forecast for growth the risks to the inflation forecast are likewise weighted to the downside
in conclusion i think the present situation obviously calls for an easing of policy as i
assumed in my forecast  given the seriousness of the situation i believe that we should put as
much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  in spite of the fact that i am going to validate
what president fisher said in terms of content i am reminded of what candidate ronald reagan
said in 1980 against george bush  to paraphrase i paid for the plane ticket down here  im
going to tell you what i learned  laughter
pessimism is running deep and no one i spoke with this round was immune to the current
economic and financial turmoil  even contacts who have sworn for months that their prudent
financial management had insulated them from funding difficulties now report being stressed
the speed of the turnaround in sentiment has been breathtaking  some of these new reports
about changes in financing conditions came from large manufacturing firms that had been doing
well this cycle  for example john deere noted that its financing subsidiary was having
difficulty rolling mediumterm notes that fund their customer leases  this seems symptomatic of
financial stress because the subsidiary has a large capital cushion with highvalue collateral
backing the leases  caterpillar did have better luck getting such funding but only because it went
to the market during a very brief window when lenders were actively seeking customers with
high credit quality  i also heard numerous reports of businesses having difficulty renewing long
standing lending arrangements with their banks and for those who were able to get new loans
the terms were typically viewed as unattractiveat least they felt so
several chicago directors indicated that businesses were successfully tapping existing
loan commitments and revolving credit much along the lines that president yellen just
mentioned  however this was not greeted enthusiastically by their bankers  in fact i heard a
very interesting story about a major new york bank ceo who spent some time in chicago a
couple of years ago  he was calling a large customer to assure him that their credit lines were
good and that they didnt need to be taken down preemptively  the customer who is our
chairman listened politely and then tapped the line anyway  laughter  no wonder banks are
worried about their liquidity position
with regard to nonfinancial developments reports on both current and expected real
activity have turned uniformly more negative  an abrupt change occurred in september  people
are spookedsorrylaughter and it is showing through to spending  retail sales are weak  i
have grown accustomed to the inherent pessimism of one of my retail contacts  he has often
said that business has never been weaker in 40 years but this time he said never in 46 years  i
also heard many reports about how the slowing in demand is worldwide
in my district the sharp slowdown is evident in the chicago purchasing managers
index  in october it plunged nearly 20 points to 378 the lowest level since the last recession in
may 2001  this index will be publicly released on friday  businesses appear to be responding
to the drop in demand by doing anything and everything they can to cut back spending  labor
demand is way off  my manpower contact indicated that even companies that are doing well
had turned cautious about hiring and are trying to squeeze out more productivity  he thought
that the drop in sentiment could have some extra impact given that it was occurring during the
annual planning cycle for corporations  the idea was that a lot of hardertosell structural
adjustments were being implemented anyway and that ceos wanted to get these moves done
quickly and have them behind them by early 2009  this is consistent with a range of reports we
have heard that new capital spending is dead in the water or that planned expansions are being
canceled  on a positive note i think we are seeing the benefits of the structural improvement
and inventory management that has occurred over the last 25 years  my contacts are reporting
some increases in inventories but they think that so far they have kept stocks under relatively
good control  with prompt production cuts we may not get the additional downside of a big
inventory swing later in the cycle perhaps when it is more painful
turning to the national outlook our forecast envisions a fullblown recession roughly on
the scale of the greenbook  but like everyone else i have a great deal of uncertainty about this
projection  things could turn out a lot worse  in contemplating the transmission from recent
financial events to the real economy there seem to be at least two channels to note  first there
is the dramatically reduced availability and higher cost of credit  second a recessionary
psychology has emerged strongly in households and businesses  with regard to the psychology
i havent spoken with anyone this round who thought there was a good reason to undertake any
kind of discretionary expenditure  clearly the selfreinforcing dynamics implied by these and
other reports could generate a deeper downturn than i have written down in my forecast  thats
a big risk  with regard to the credit channel the hit to the nonfinancial sector has intensified a
good bit  we clearly are sailing in uncharted waters when it comes to quantifying these effects
the factors identified in the greenbook highlight the unprecedented nature of the financial
impulses to the economy
looking ahead i expect that the improvement in financial conditions will be somewhat
faster than in the greenbook  that is my cautious optimism  still in our forecast financial
headwinds weigh substantially on growth throughout 2009 and continue to a degree into 2010
accordingly substantial resource gaps remain open throughout the projection period  also i
expect inflation expectations to decline in this depressed environment  with greater slack lower
inflation expectations the reduction in energy and other commodity prices and the higher value
of the dollar we are projecting core inflation to move under 2 percent by 2010  and i wont be
shocked if the greenbook projection for this to happen in 2009 actually happens  so on balance
i think that inflationary risks are low but the downside risks to the economy are very high  much
as president fisher indicated it is much in line with the reports so far  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  business and consumer sentiment in the
fifth district has deteriorated markedly  even though economic conditions were already
decelerating heading into our september meeting a discrete shift in outlook seems to have
occurred  it seems to me to have originated during the week of september 15 or shortly
thereafter  our business contacts express anxiety about the national economy and they express
uncertainty about the meaning for their firms prospects of the astonishing sequence of events
that began unfolding that week  both consumers and firms have been increasingly unwilling to
make longterm commitments and engage in discretionary expenditures  consumers are
delaying large and discretionary expenditures  firms have adopted a waitandsee attitude on
investments
our regional survey released this morning shows a substantial drop in business conditions
as well  our business survey respondents report that obtaining business loans is more difficult
than three months ago and there are widespread reports of lenders tightening credit terms and
seeking to reduce exposures  most respondents however also indicated that they would still be
able to satisfy their borrowing needs  when you listen to bankers they will tell you that they are
tightening standards but they also report that they are still extending credit to solid borrowers
with highquality deals
i find it difficult right now to pin down the real effects of the financial market turmoil of
the last few weeks  as the greenbook notes assessing such effects poses significant
identification challenges  specifically it is hard to disentangle the effects of the increased cost
of bank capital from those of the deterioration in the economic environment facing borrowers
personally i suspect the latter are playing the more prominent role in the tightening of credit
terms right now
looking on the bright side the nearterm inflation picture has eased noticeably since our
september meeting mainly because of the decline in oil and other commodity prices  the
greenbook carries this moderation into its longterm forecast where pce inflation now
converges to 1 percent in 2013  i did a doubletake when i saw thatit had me wondering
whether the greenbook was ghostwritten this month by president plosser  laughter
whoevers forecast it is the longerterm projected moderation in inflation relies heavily on the
openingup of a large and persistent output gap  in the current circumstances i am not sure how
plausible that story is  in particular i have been struggling with how to think about the effect of
credit market disruptions on the concept of potential output  to the extent that we think of these
disruptions as analogous to shocks to intermediation technologyand that is what the models of
these kinds of credit channel effects generally tell you to doit seems to me that we should see
them as pulling down potential as well as actual output  i believe this point has been made at
previous meetings  we have also talked before about the tenuous nature of the phillips curve
relationship and it is difficult to forecast  the slope is sort of flat  we had been scheduled to
discuss inflation dynamics and we postponed that for good reasons i believe  i hope we can get
back to it soon because i think its going to be relevant to how we see our way through this  in
any event i think we should be careful not to be overly optimistic about the forecast of an
inflation decline driven by a large output gap  the shift in the greenbooks longterm inflation
projection is noteworthy for another reason i believe  we are getting closer to a 1 percent target
federal funds rate and we may actually reach 1 percent at some meeting soon  the last time this
happened it sparked a widespread discussion of and concern about the zero lower bound on
nominal interest rates
i want to make a couple of related observations  first a key to conducting monetary
policy at the zero bound is being able to keep inflation expectations from falling and thereby
increasing real interest rates  from this perspective the revision of the greenbooks forecast
from 17 percent one meeting ago to 10 percent for fiveyearahead inflation implies that we run
a monetary policy regime in which fiveyearahead expected inflation varies pretty significantly
in response to contemporaneous shocks  i dont think that variability in longrun inflation
projections can help our ability to manage inflation expectations at the zero bound  wed be
better if we ran a policy in which longrun expected inflation was more anchored more stable
you can tell where im going with this im sure  this highlights the value of an explicit
inflation objective as well as the value of being able to communicate clearly about how we view
the functioning of monetary policy at the zero bound  second i will just note briefly that the
economics of monetary policy at the zero bound are closely related to the economics of paying
interest on reserves at close to the target rate  in fact if im not mistaken they are virtually
identical  i think progress on both fronts would be useful right now
finally let me just comment on financial market conditions  my sense is that what the
public has seenthe large failures the variety of resolution techniques the deliberations leading
up to the congresss adoption of the bill it adoptedtaken together have added up to significant
pessimism on peoples parts and have altered optimal strategy for a lot of financial institutions
so i think that is altering how people allocate portfolios and has led to further volatility in certain
markets  it has led some institutions to adopt a waitandsee attitude to see how particular
programs are going to be implemented  i think that we are seeing at least some deadweight loss
associated with the burdens of shifting financial flows between things that are covered and things
that arent and we are seeing a good deal of rentseeking behavior as well  what we are seeing is
going to have the effect of masking the evolution of underlying fundamentals  it is going to
make it harder to see our way through this and understand just what is happening  i think that is
going to be a thicket that we will need to cut through in the months ahead  that concludes my
comments mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  while the liborois spread has
narrowed somewhat the mutual fund industry is no longer experiencing waves of redemptions and
commercial paper market conditions have improved were still not back to the shortterm credit
conditions that prevailed before the failure of lehman brothers  this outcome is striking
considering the historic interventions that have occurred in the past month  with all of the new
government guarantees and equity infusions here and abroad the limited improvement in shortterm
credit markets attests to the degree of concern and risk aversion prevailing in financial markets
these concerns are likely to become even more elevated if the economy slows to the degree
expected in most forecasts  like the greenbook our forecast anticipates a significant recession
the boston forecast includes three consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth and results in an
unemployment rate peaking above 7 percent  the weakening labor market and the large losses in
housing and stock wealth make it quite likely that consumption will shrink in the second half of this
year  while we need housing to reach bottom mortgage rates relative to federal funds rates remain
quite high and further job losses are likely to aggravate the upward trend in foreclosures and add to
the downward pressure on housing prices  with limited new home purchases and demand for
vehicles weak consumption of consumer durables is unlikely to recover until next year
commercial real estate which has held up reasonably well all things considered is likely to be
much weaker next year as new and rollover financing is difficult to obtain and staff cuts and hiring
freezes affect the space needed by businesses  more generally firms are likely to have little
incentive to make new investments until the severity of the downturn becomes much clearer
unfortunately many of our trading partners are likely to face an even more severe downturn
aggravated by their slow fiscal and monetary response to deteriorating economic and financial
conditions  while the greenbook assumes the stock market will rise by 8 percent for the remainder
of this yearit looks as though that happened today
chairman bernanke  nice job dave  laughter
mr stockton  i think that just offset the decline that had happened since the time we
finished the greenbook  laughter
mr rosengren  i would say that id be surprised by that outcome
there are several looming financial problems that are likely to affect financial markets  bill
dudley highlighted the one that i think is the biggest for me which is that the nav net asset value
triggers for hedge funds will be a significant problem in the fourth quarter  without comprehensive
information on hedge funds its difficult to know the extent of the problems they are facing
however since the stock market remains one of the few markets available for the disposing of
assets in bulk without a significant liquidity haircut id expect significant selling in the fourth
quarter  my second big concern is that rollover financing will become more problematic as
financial problems persist  particularly exposed are real estate developers and highly leveraged
private equity firms  my third worry is that neither insurance companies nor commercial banks
have reserved for the economic outcome in our baseline forecast  underreserving and high payout
ratios are likely to limit the amount of additional lending that banks are willing to take on  these
financial problems place additional downside risk to our forecast
our forecast like the greenbook forecast expects the rate of inflation to slow as a result of
falling food and energy prices and significant excess capacity emerging in the economy  in fact our
equations indicate there is a nonnegligible risk that deflation will be a problem in the outyears of
our forecast  unlike president lacker i was surprised that it stayed as high as 1 rather than as low
as 1  the outlook for a weak real economy and falling inflation highlights the need for both
monetary and fiscal policy to offset some of the financial and economic problems that we are likely
to experience  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  let me just briefly say that in our region we
have continued to do actually better than the national average but that is beginning to wane  we are
seeing obviously the energy effect show itself as rigs are being put out of production and you see a
slowing there  we are seeing some concerns being raised about agricultural prices and the boom
that has been going on in that part of the economy
that said theres still a reasonable amount of business going on that they havent frozen up
we asked our directors and our other advisers how they were seeing things and it varies  there
were some organizations that say that our noninvestmentgrade borrowers from the banks if they
had credit already are still able to access those lines  if they lost some portion because of a bank
problem or something like that they cannot get new credit so it is cut off in that way  i think thats
important to keep in mind  businesses themselves are beginning to pull back on their capital plans
theyve said that  their balance sheetsobviously outside the auto industryare still decent but
theyre saying were looking at this and were pulling back until we see how it plays out  you
are beginning to hear more of that  they feel that they can get credit  some of them are talking
about actually trying to pull down their lines to make sure they have the money and the only thing
keeping them from doing that is they dont know what to do with it once they get it  so thats their
dilemma  theyre afraid of losing their credit but they also know that it costs if they pull it down
so the dynamics there are interesting
on the national outlook ill be brief  i think that obviously the projections for recession are
in place  down is where were going  how much though is speculation right now  i dont know
i dont know that anyone does until we begin to see things settle out  inflation should be down as
well  obviously when you have a recession you will back off from that but how much  thats
not clear at this point  there is a lot in play and thats why we dont know the answers to those
questions  we have these liquidity facilities and an enormous amount of liquidity out  we have the
tarp that is now in process but not completed  thats going to have an impact and i think those
are very important  as we discuss our own policy we are very close to the point of the quantitative
easing discussion that we had as you said in 2003  pulling that material out and taking a look at
that is important as we decide what were going to put our money into as we try to stimulate this
economy  right now were subject to waiting and seeing  theres been a lot done and attitudes are
a critical part of this now and we just have to wait to see how those change over the next quarter or
two  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  im not going to say much about the district
conditions  in the third district as many of you have noted theyve weakened considerably  i will
make just a couple of observations that i think might be pertinent  our last business outlook
survey the one that was released a week ago had actually gone into positive territory in september
to 38 which was the first positive reading we had had since januarysince i guess last
december actually  and it dropped from that plus 38 to minus 375 in one month  now its
relevant to know the timing of this a bit  our survey is done during the first 2 weeks or the first 10
or 12 days of each monthwhich meant that the september survey was closed on september 12 4
days before that weekend  so what we see is a very precipitous dramatic change in the tone that
had as much to do with events and perhaps policy actions as with what was actually going on in the
economy
i share a bit of president lackers concern to try to disentangle a little the tone and feel of
the economy which really did feel as though it fell off a cliff in september unlike any other month
that ive seen during this episode  we have to think carefully about disentangling that effect not just
because something fundamental happened to the economy but also to see to what extent policies
whether our policies or treasurys policies have contributed to a change in tone and increased
uncertainty and aggravated what might be the real fundamentals going on  i dont know the answer
to that question but it suggests something that many of us have argued over timethat more
consistent and morepredictable policies can help us avoid some of that
one special question that was asked in this survey in october was whether firms had trouble
getting credit  interestingly enough only 14 percent of the respondents reported that they had
trouble obtaining credit but twice that number almost 30 percent reported that they believed that
their customers were having trouble getting credit which was an interesting dynamic going on that
leads to a bit of uncertainty  i guess the best thing i can say about the third district right now is
go phillies  laughter  maybe that will turn things around in the third district
anyway let me turn briefly to the national outlook  it has deteriorated certainly more than
i expected from what i thought in june  in our conference call on october 7 i indicated that i was
revising my forecast downward  i expect the economy to contract during the second half of this
year and perhaps in the first quarter of next yearbut thats less clear to meand then gradually
approach what i would consider trend growth over 2009 so that by the end of 2009 were getting
back toward what might be considered trend growth which i consider to be about 25 to 27 percent
in essence for 201011 i pushed out my recovery of the economy by somewhere between six and
nine months because of the current turmoil  i expect the unemployment rate to peak around mid
09 at about 7 and then to decline gradually to its longrun rate of about 5 percent by the end of
2010  inflation pressures have subsided somewhat since june and inflation expectations have
remained contained  i expect core inflation to decline gradually from the current levels to my goal
of about 17 percent by 2010
now my overall forecast is considerably better than the greenbook baseline forecast  in
fact its similar to what we talked about as the more rapid financial recovery scenario which
makes some of the adjustment for the financial turmoil somewhat quicker and somewhat less
dramatic than in the baseline  the fed funds rate path underlying my forecast is less
accommodative than the greenbook  i assume that the fed funds rate remains at 1 percent through
the spring of next year and then gradually begins to rise reaching 4 percent by the end of 2010
now there are certainly risks around that forecast  somebody at this table has to be a little more
optimistic after all and we have risks around all forecasts in this environment  certainly mine is no
exception  in particular the effect of the financial markets as weve all been talking about remains
highly uncertain and highly risky and i am not trying to disregard that  every day it seems as
though theres a new development usually negative although i guess 900 points on the dow today
should be considered good news
but in fact i believe that the risks around the greenbook baseline forecast are to the upside
as i have alluded to  first the baseline entails a sizable downward adjustment based at least partly
on the volatile financial data especially spreads  spreads can fall dramatically although they dont
always do so  but they can rise and fall very quickly and i think its very risky to base monetary
policy which ought to be taking a longerterm perspective on weektoweek movements in such
volatile variables  if spreads do continue to fall over the next quarter or two as they have in recent
days and if the financial market tools weve put in place have the desired effect we could see the
economy becoming much stronger than the greenbooks baseline  second in the greenbook
inflation falls and remains low despite a very low fed funds rate path  in fact its reminiscent of the
funds rate path in 200304  this apparently is due to the sizable output gaps that open up in the
forecast period  now these output gaps arise in the forecast because the effects of the financial
turmoil show up mainly in aggregate demand  however as ive suggested in previous meetings
and as president lacker alluded to i think a plausible alternative view is that the financial market
disturbances weve experiencedresulting in a restructuring of the financial system and a lowering
of the efficiency of financial intermediationact on the supply side as well much like a somewhat
persistent productivity shock with an associated damping effect on measures of potential gdp for
some period of time  if so well see much smaller output gaps opening up and that means the risk
of higher inflation than in the greenbook especially if the baseline funds rate path is followed as
they lay out
in thinking about the appropriate monetary policy going forward its important that we not
let our policy be whipsawed by volatile market data  we have been lowering the funds rate since
january largely in anticipation of a recession or to mitigate the chances of one occurring  now it
may finally have arrived  does that mean we have to lower more  a difficult question  the level
of the funds rate is always a difficult question  clearly if we experience a sustained slowdown in
real economic activity which suggests a lower equilibrium in the real rate of interest policy needs
to allow the funds rate to fall with the equilibrium rate and i based my recommendations
throughout the year on such a forecast  but i think its a mistake to overreact to volatile data
especially when its the stock market  although there has always been the desire and much pressure
from markets to do something when we see such swings in the market in my view the economy is
better served if monetary policy is a steadying hand taking appropriate action when the
intermediateterm view dictates but not overreacting to fluctuations in the market with an
inappropriate tool  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  i have a question about the potential output view  so you
would also have to argue that the natural rate of unemployment is higher because of this
mr plosser  yes
chairman bernanke  you think thats plausible  i mean i understand why
productive capacity would be affected but why do you
mr plosser  well i dont like the nairu but in my baseline forecast my natural rate
of unemployment is higher than what the greenbook has
chairman bernanke  but it rises because of the financial situation  i see
mr plosser  yes right
mr lacker  if i could mr chairman in the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
models one of which i understand has been adopted by the staff for use in forecasting employment
fluctuates with shocks to productivity and its the natural correspondent to that  so in some sense
the unemployment rate rises because the natural rate rises but thats a way of saying that the natural
rate goes up in recessions  im not sure if proponents of the natural rate view that as consistent with
that old model but thats what happens in these models
chairman bernanke  employment fluctuates but to get unemployment you need a
richer picture of matching or something like that
mr lacker  right  you need some matching model and you get intersectoral flows
you get the same thing
mr plosser  but even in my steady state if i view this as a permanent inefficiency in
financial intermediation that changes things the unemployment rate is a little higher
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  ill start with a few comments about the district
economy which will sound pretty familiar by now  the preponderance of the anecdotes from
business contacts that ive talked with since our last meeting have been distinctly negative  its not
just a slowing of activity or some deterioration but a sharp contraction in activity particularly with
regard to discretionary spending or discretionary projects beginning in the middle of september
the one exception to that is commercial construction where there are enough things under way that
business remains pretty good  but the backlogs are dropping and so weakness certainly is
anticipated next year  i thought another possible exception to the negative tone was the housing
market in the twin citiesnot that the housing market in the twin cities is in and of itself so
important but that it might be representative of some middleoftheroad markets across the country
clearly its not indicative of whats going on in florida california or places like those because
sales volumes in the twin cities had been up distinctly  some of that is no doubt due to short sales
and foreclosures nevertheless there were some other signs that were favorable  the affordability
index has really improved a lot  it is back to levels of 200203 which realtors call very
comfortable  the ratio of housing prices to rent has moved back to the levels of 200203 and thats
also encouraging  i already mentioned the higher sales volumes
unfortunately when you get beyond those statistics and look at other things its too early to
declare stability in the housing market or anything resembling underlying improvement  part of the
problem is something that weve talked about before  the inventory of unsold unoccupied
properties remains very substantialby historical experience way above anything resembling
normal  second even though the pricetorent ratio has come down its still elevated relative to the
longerterm historical experience  so it looks to me as though even in that market there are some
further price declines to come and its going to take some more time to get through all of this
probably well into next year
as far as the national economy is concerned i too have marked down my outlook for real
growth for the balance of this year for all of next year and into early 2010 as well  this reflects to
some extent the nature of the incoming data but also the intensification of the financial problems
and associated headwinds the impact of the negative wealth effect and so on  when i looked at my
june forecast back then the forecast obviously looked better although there were a number of what
i called identifiable negatives  they have proven for worse rather than for better to be relevant
i already talked about some of them  in addition we still have the problem in housing with excess
inventories  we have steady declines in employment which obviously have negative implications
for consumer spending and the credit headwinds as well  so now i have the economy contracting
through the middle of next year modest growth resuming thereafter and robust growth beginning
with the second quarter of 2010quite some distance off
on the inflation outlook i have for some time been thinking that inflation would begin to
slow this quarter  with the decline in commodity prices the evolution of the economic outlook and
so forth my confidence in that forecast has increased and i do expect inflation to diminish over the
forecast period  so i think ill conclude with that
chairman bernanke  okay  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i concur with the view that we face a very
serious situation  in most respects i agree with the greenbook baseline projection with the
reasoning that the board staff used to arrive at the projection and with their view that the risks to
growth are to the downside  like the greenbook projection my projection is heavily influenced by
judgments that we are bringing to the projection from forces that are not captured by our models
the magnitude of the judgmental adjustment has become strikingly large as we talked about earlier
and i realize that if one wanted to be a skeptic about the greenbook baseline one would have to
look no further than these assumptions and question their significant influence on the outlook
but i am not a skeptic  during the past few weeks in our bank we have stepped up our
contacts with business people from large medium and smaller businesses bankers and local
government officials  we have been asking them to tell us not so much what they think and feel but
what has actually happened to their order books production runs and account receivables and what
actions they are taking as a result  it suffices to say that the feedback about the environment was
overwhelmingly negative  respondents say that their situation has gone either from good to bad or
from bad to worse and i want to share just two anecdotes that i think capture the essence of what
we are facingone of them from a business perspective and the other from a consumer perspective
one of my directors is the ceo of a company that produces and sells forklift trucks all over the
world  he reported last week that his sales are down and orders have fallen off dramatically and he
expects to be announcing some layoffs soon  but what was making a greater impression on him is
the fact that orders for the forklift parts have fallen off as well and this tells him that the warehouse
operators have cut back on the use of trucks that they already own  my second story concerns the
owner of a body shop that is located in a solid middle class community  he told us that he was
doing record business all year until last month when business just went dead  he said it is not that
people suddenly dont need auto repairs but in fact they are collecting the insurance money and not
fixing their cars  they want the cash and they dont want to pay out the deductible
stories like these convince me that the greenbook baseline is on the right track  i do part
company with the greenbook in one respectnamely the longerterm inflation outlook  i think it
is quite likely that we are going to experience some costly reallocation of resources across some
sectors of the economy  finance and construction are two obvious examples  going forward i
think there is reason to think that fewer workers and less capital are going to be employed in these
sectors  the costly adjustment is going to be characterized by slower productivity growth higher
trend unit labor costs and a smaller output gap than would otherwise occur leading to somewhat
less disinflation in the outyears in my projection  nevertheless with output and inflation expected
to decline sharply over the coming quarters i think it is essential for us to be thinking about the zero
bound in conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment and i will address the
magnitude timing and communication aspects of our monetary policy in tomorrows goround
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  economic conditions in the eighth district
have deteriorated since the september beige book  citing weak demand and higher input costs a
variety of manufacturing firms throughout the district reported job cuts and plant closings  the
decline in manufacturing activity has been concentrated in firms producing durable goods  service
sector activity also continues to decline  in particular recent layoffs have been reported in business
medical and financial services  two large auto dealers have closed and filed for bankruptcy  retail
sales are steady but contacts have noticed that consumers are trading down to lowerpriced
products  the residential real estate sector continues to decline across the district  as lending
standards have tightened for commercial building projects industrial construction has slowed
payroll employment numbers continue to vary across the banks branch cities  the most
recent figures suggest that memphis and st louis continue to lose jobs at a pace faster than at the
national level  louisville has moved from two consecutive months of positive yearoveryear
employment growth to negative growth in the most recent month  little rock continues to
experience positive yearoveryear employment growth  unemployment rates in st louis and
memphis remain above 7 percentthats 72 percent and 71 percent respectively  louisvilles
unemployment rate is 66 percent  in opposition to the national trend little rocks unemployment
rate has fallen to just 4 percent
the national outlook is clouded by dramatically increased uncertainty fueled by the financial
market turmoil  the explosion of uncertainty is driven in part by speculation about the nature of the
government response to the turmoil both in the united states and abroad  we know from past
experience that when economic actorsinvestors businesses and consumersare faced with new
and substantial uncertainty they tend to adopt a wait and see approach during which they make
as few commitments as possible  this seems to be a reasonable expectation in the current
environment so we should expect to see many types of important economic decisions being
deferred  anecdotal evidence seems to support this idea  most likely this means we will
experience an important deterioration in economic activity during the second half of 2008 and into
2009
in times of increased uncertainty it can be useful to consider distinct alternative scenarios
instead of considering a baseline scenario with many possible offshoots  the financial sector crisis
that we are experiencing has some admittedly inexact parallels with the banking crises that occurred
in japan since 1990 and in the nordic countries in the early 1990s  the general tenor of the
literature on these events is that the nordic countries dealt forthrightly with their financial sector
problems suffered through recessions but were well positioned to grow once the crisis had been
addressed  for japan real economic performance was subpar for a long time and it is the japanese
outcome that is a looming risk for the us economy  part of the japanese experience was the
lowering of nominal interest rates to zero  this was done no doubt in the name of doing
everything possible to help the economy recover  it was not very successful and in fact may have
been counterproductive
recent academic workim thinking of jess benhabib herehas emphasized the
possibility of a low nominal interest rate low inflation rate steady state equilibrium and a trap at
very low or zero nominal interest rates  this steady state coexists with the targeted steady state the
one we know and love which has inflation at our specified target and relatively high nominal
interest rates  so there are two possible focal points for the economy  markets clear at both of these
focal points  my main concern is that if we choose to continue to flirt with the trap steady state we
should think clearly about the possible implications given the current environment  the trap steady
state is associated with very low inflation expectations actually deflation  this is in fact what
happened to japan  they experienced deflation of about 1 percent for a number of years  since our
core problems are in the housing market which is dominated by nominal contracting deflation
could sharply exacerbate our problems and lead to further difficulties  i am frankly not sure that
this is a wise route for the committee or for the nation  my preferred approach would be to
maintain rates at the current low level and to use alternative fiscal policy actions to address the
particular concerns in financial markets  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  well its a little after 600 pm a long afternoon
why dont we recess the meeting until tomorrow morning  theres a reception and a dinner up on
the terrace which is for your convenience  theres no business being conducted and well see you
in the morning  thank you
meeting recessed
october 29 2008morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody
participants  good morning
chairman bernanke  we have some data this morning  dave would you like to
discuss this
mr stockton6  yes  you have at your place a table on orders and shipments of
durable goods one of the more inscrutable releases to actually make sense of but the bottom line is
very little effect on our basic outlook here  as you can see in that second set of numbers the
shipments area excluding the aircraft line was up 2 percent in september  that was actually a little
stronger than we had penciled in but only enough to add a few basis points to gdp growth in the
third quarter  then you can see that it has basically been averaging flat for the last two months
this is a september figure so its fairly dated at this point  the orders figures the set of numbers
aboveagain looking at the excluding aircraft linehave been coming down  i wouldnt say
that theyre collapsing but theyre certainly weakening some  so this really has no appreciable
effect on our outlook for a small decline in equipment spending in the third quarter and a more
appreciable decline in the fourth
chairman bernanke  does the resolution of the boeing strike have any macro
implications
mr stockton  we actually predicted that the strike would end this week  it did
mr plosser  my youre good
mr stockton  it wasnt looking too good last week  laughter  but were expecting
that it would provide a small rebound effect on firstquarter gdp growth  its going to take a little
while to get production back on track here

6  the materials used by mr stockton are appended to this transcript appendix 6
chairman bernanke  other questions for dave  okay  if not lets continue with
our goround  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  we expect a recession at
least as bad as the 199091 recession with a significant risk of a deeper more protracted downturn
worse than the 80s and a very substantial rise in the unemployment rate  inflation is decelerating
quickly and deflationary forces are ascendant around the globe  the huge decline in energy and
commodity prices will add to a very substantial downward pressure on core inflation from increased
economic slack around the world  we could see an abrupt change in inflation expectations into
deflationary territory
weve seen a lot of policy action over the past few weeks  one question is whether
policymakers should wait to measure the effects of these measures before going further and i want
to talk a little about that question  my view is that i dont think so  the outlook has been
deteriorating ahead of the policy response  this is true both here and around the world  the
magnitude and speed of the tightening financial conditions the erosion in business and consumer
confidence the fall in actual spending and the shift in inflation risk together present very grave
risks to growth and to the financial system  mitigating these risks is going to require more monetary
policy here but even more so in the other major economies  but in addition to the very substantial
easing in the global stance of monetary policy ahead the substantial damage that has already
happened to financial intermediation globally suggests that a broadbased and quite large fiscal
stimulus will be critical to prevent an excessive fall in aggregate demand
how quickly and how far should we reduce the federal funds rate in the united states  the
greenbook and the bluebook present a very strong case for moving down another 100 basis points
quickly  in fact if i read the pictures in the bluebook correctly they might imply a need to get real
rates to the negative 3 to negative 5 percent territory relatively quickly if we could do that  if we
dont move another 50 today well be behind again  monetary policy has effectively tightened
substantially since the summer of course because of the intensification of financial pressures and
because of the rise in forward real interest rates that have come with the rapid deceleration in
expected future inflation  beyond this meeting and this choice our choices are harder  i think we
need to get real rates lower and to make sure we get them there we need to keep them low enough
long enough  this requires that we get the nominal fed funds rate as low as possible as soon as
possible  i dont see a good case for monetary policy gradualism in the current context  the risks
are too great  if were too tentative the damage to the financial system and to the real economy
could be much greater and much harder to correct  if we end up doing too much we can always
adjust  thats an easier problem to solve  it just requires will  with global financial markets
placing progressively more weight on a very severe global recession the keep our powder dry and
reserve our remaining ammunition arguments dont seem that compelling to me  we dont have
much ammunition left in the fed funds rate anyway  if we hold that back it will likely be less
effective when we ultimately use it  the more powerful escalation options we have left will
probably involve communications such as continued commitments to keep rates low enough long
enough that we avert creeping expectations of deflation and can be confident that inflation will
come in around our target level over the forecast period
i dont have a strong view now about how low we can go with the nominal fed funds rate
without causing too much risk of damage to the functioning of financial systems  we need to look
at all possible options though  i think the principal focus of our staffs work in the coming weeks
will be to put together a set of alternative policy options going forward along with the analysis of
their benefits and risks so that were in a position to act quickly enough to be effective  just a few
final points  i think this basic riskmanagement choice really involves three dimensions of
judgment  one is about the relative probability of alternative outcomes  the second is about the
relative consequences of or the damage caused by those alternative scenarios  importantly it also
involves a judgment about the ease of correcting adjusting or mitigating the consequences of being
wrong
this is just a stylized presentation but in the staff notes yesterday there was a nice way to
think about those choices  i just wanted to point out one thing about this stylized framework of
those choices which is the consequence  if you look at exhibit 5 the bottom left panel which
shows the inflation outcome associated with the more rapid recovery scenario in this presentation
you dont have much risk of a very bad inflation outcome in the event that we end up doing too
much with too much policy and have to take that back  again its important to recognize that its
not just about the probability that we attach to the alternative scenarios  its not just about the
relative impact of the consequences of those scenarios  its about the ease with which we can
correct for a judgment that was wrongin this case a judgment that we did too much  this may
understate the complications in correcting for that error and may make it look easier than it may
ultimately be but i think its a nice framework
finally i just want to point out just to underscore the basic point  this is not going to be
principally about monetary policy going forward  if you look at the broad framework of policies
that are now in place both here and globally and the instruments we have to play with along with
the fiscal authorities we have monetary policy we have the liquidity arrangements and what we do
with our balance sheet over time we the collectively integrated government have the broad fiscal
policy questions and the scope for either a broadbased substantial fiscal package or moretargeted
fiscal measures as the chairman suggested to focus on the credit markets and we have the
capacity to alter the framework of capital and guarantees that is now in place  beyond that the
government here also has the ability to change what the gses the fha and the fhlb can do  so
when we think about escalating going forward to go to president fishers question from yesterday
we have the ability on all these fronts to do more if thats necessary and prudent  but i think the
mix has already changed substantially  it was probably mostly fiscal nine months ago  it is
certainly mostly fiscal now in a broader sense except that many of the major economies going
forward will have to move monetary policy very substantially  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  a number of the presentations yesterday talked
about falling off a cliff in the middle of september  i think we need to remind ourselves that we
were sliding downhill pretty fast before we hit that cliff  the thirdquarter data which arent really
affected by what happened in the last two weeks of september indicate that the economy was
weaker than we thought at the time of the last fomc meeting  i think dave stockton or norm
morin noted that about a third of their downward revision reflected incoming data rather than the
credit tightening  that was especially true for consumption with real consumption spending falling
through the summer responding to lower employment and tighter credit  private domestic final
purchases were revised down to a decline of 3 percent in the third quarter after being flat in the
first half
housing price declines picked up in august and i think the deteriorating economy and
concerns about the economy were reflected in increased nervousness in financial markets over the
summer into the first half of september  it was really those worries about what the losses were
going to be and how they would spread from mortgages to loan books generallythat deepening
pessimismthat doomed the marginal institutions like aig and lehman and the gses  they just
didnt have a chance to recapitalize or stabilize themselves when so many of the other market
participants were worried about what their own positions would be  the resulting flight to liquidity
and safety the loss of confidence that followed the deepening gloom and the failures and near
failures and associated losses triggered a tremendous tightening of financial conditions over the
intermeeting periodpresident yellen and others discussed thisdespite the 50 basis points of
easing  even after the 900 point increase yesterday equity prices are down about 20 or 22 percent
over the intermeeting period  the dollar is up 10 percent  corporate borrowing rates are up for
investmentgrade corporations 200 to 250 basis points  banks tell us that theyre tightening across
every dimension of their lending and other lenders like finance companies are also cutting back
very very sharply  you can see this in autos clearly but the stress is much broader than just the
auto finance companies
we have good programs in place to deal with many of these problemsthe capital the
fdic guarantees and the federal reserve balance sheet facilitiesand they are having some
effects relative to the freezing up of markets that we had in midseptember  we can see that
interbank spreads and libor have come down some  commercial paper rose i guess on monday
with the introduction of our facility  declines in money market mutual funds have abated though
theyre still there and there are some signs that maturities are beginning to lengthen in funding
markets  as these programs are more fully implemented well see some greater effectsincluding
i hope some greater willingness to extend credit  i also assume that the fiscal package is necessary
as in the greenbook fiscal stimulus alternative
but we need to remember that the improvement weve seen over the last couple of days is
relative to a situation in which funding markets were in effect frozen beyond a very short term and
although a sharp snapback is possible as president plosser was noting yesterday i think further
gains are more likely to be gradual  in the past few days the declines in libor have seemed very
grudging and gradual and libor remains quite highi think close to 75 basis points higher
relative to what it was in midaugust before we even cut rates  this was threemonth libor that i
looked at this morning  in an environment of economic weakness spreading credit problems
falling house prices a number of false dawns in this episode so far and death and neardeath
experiences lenders and investors are going to continue to be very cautious and conserve their
liquidity and capital  so despite further improvements financial conditions will remain quite tight
the effects of lower wealth higher borrowing costs the stronger dollar and tighter nonprice terms
of credit will play out over the next few quarters putting downward pressure on an economy that
was already in recession
at the same time heightened uncertainty and fear of future problems caused a sharp
deterioration in attitudes and spending even apart from the effects of credit  judging from the
conference board index regional purchasing manager surveys and anecdotesincluding what we
heard around the table yesterdayit feels like a recessionary psychology as i think charlie evans
called it  others talked about pulling back and curtailment of discretionary spending in train and
this is not just caused by credit effects  this is just fear  so weve had a downward shift in
aggregate demand as well as a movement along the aggregate demand curve and this downward
shift in aggregate demand will propagate through multiplieraccelerator effects even if attitudes
begin to improve some
the global dimensions of the shock are important  as we talked about yesterday
heightened risk aversion has had a pronounced effect on emerging market economies as well as on
industrial economies  net exports cushioned domestic weakness in the first half of the year but
with the dollar strong if anything well be absorbing weakness from abroad not exporting it as the
rest of the year goes on and we get into next year  growing credit problems abroad will only add to
pressures on many large global lenders who might have thought they were diversified
geographically  but a little like our us housing market they will find that diversification doesnt
really work when theres a global recession
the net effect of all of this is a much weaker growth path for the economy  in my forecast i
had a somewhat steeper nearterm decline in economic activity and a slightly sharper bounceback
than the staff including my fiscal assumption but i also have the unemployment rate peaking at
over 7 percent as the greenbook did  with commodity prices plunging the added slack maintained
through several years and declines in inflation expectations inflation will be on a clear downward
track  in the greenbook this downward track for inflation obtained even with the assumption of
some rebound in commodity prices and the resumption of dollar weakness  in my forecast for
inflation from next year on inflation was at or below the 1 to 2 percent rate i would like to see as
a steady state consistent with avoiding the zero bound when adverse shocks hit
critically the downside risks around activity forecasts are huge and tilted to the downside  i
think theyre huge because weve never seen a situation like this before certainly not in my
experience dating all the way back to 1970 and have only the vaguest notion of how it will play out
in financial markets and spending  i think theyre tilted to the downside because i like the staff
assumed a gradual improvement in financial markets  that could be delayed or even go in the
wrong direction for a time further tightening financial conditions  in addition the effect on
spending of the heightened concerns and tighter credit conditions could be larger and longer lasting
than i assumed  for some time an important downside risk to the forecast has been a sharp upward
revision to household saving as wealth job availability and borrowing capacity eroded  i assumed
a moderate increase in the saving rate but i can definitely see the possibility that adverse
developments will galvanize a  more thorough rethinking by the household sector of what saving is
needed and that will affect investment as well as consumption  well get to the policy implications
of all of this in the next round  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  the first sentence of the greenbook said that
recent economic and financial news has been dismal and the last sentence on page 1 of the
bluebook said that markets generally remain extremely illiquid and volatile  i cant do better than
that but i can certainly do worse so let me give that a try  laughter
market prices and official and corporate data confirm an additional leg down in mid
september which has been much discussed  i think it is going to become increasingly clear that
october particularly the first 20 days of the month was materially worse  so if we fell off the cliff
in the middle of september i think that once the data come out and find their way into the
marketplace in october the greenbook forecast might look a bit more positive than the facts on the
ground would suggest  as a result my own forecast is less optimistic than the greenbook but there
is plenty of uncertainty as i think dave stockton talked about yesterday
let me make a few comments about financial markets before turning to the broader
economy  i expect a prolonged period of significantly strained credit markets and that strain is
likely to be exacerbated between now and yearend and i suspect even well into 2009  the credit
intermediation process that weve talked about is fundamentally broken  i talked six months ago
about the financial architecture that was fundamentally being changed  i think that has all happened
faster than i could have anticipated  confidence not just in counterparties but in basic rules of
doing business across financial markets has been lost and my own sense is that loss of confidence
is not easily fixed even by wellintended government programs  we should all be quite patient in
terms of seeing the benefits of the rather dramatic actions taken by the official sector both here in
the united states and overseas  corporate bond rates and other risk spreads may well fall from their
recent peaks as suggested in the greenbook but spreads across asset classes are likely to stay far
wider than historical norms throughout the forecast period  i think these new spread relationships
are uncertain  so what we thought would be sort of normal spreads of libor and normal spreads
of corporate bonds all have to be reassessed not just by us but also by market participants  even if
credit is now made more available to businesses through some of these new treasury and other
programs i suspect the allin cost of capital is likely to materially impede business investment
particularly given expectations by businesses for a weaker economy in the upcoming period  as
vice chairman geithner suggested monetary policy might be able to do a bit about this but it is not
going to be able to change it very much
let me turn to three points on the economy before closing  first in the near term given my
sense of how october is tracking its likely to be extraordinarily weak  i expect weaker fourth
quarter consumption than the greenbook weaker labor markets going into 2009 and a materially
weaker fourthquarter gdp print  some labor surveysincluding some of my own preferred
measures like the joltsseem to be holding up but im not sure that thats going to hold for
another couple of months  so id expect the labor markets to trend more materially in the direction
that ive discussed
well what about beyond the near term  what about 2009 and beyond  it strikes me that
the catalysts for marked improvement are lacking  when i think about fiscal policy regulatory
policy tax policy and trade policy which i talked about previously its not obvious to me that any
of those are going to provide some kind of catalyst for a marked change in the contour of the
economy  on the fiscal front i assume that the fiscal stimulus is likely to be larger maybe even
materially larger than in the greenbook alternative simulation but my own conclusions are similar
to the greenbooks which is that im not sure its going to be terribly effective  im not sure its
going to be constructed in that way and im not sure it will do nearly as much as it will inevitably
be advertised to do  a more disturbing trend probably even than the efficacy of a fiscal package
which in my own view is absolutely necessary but again i query whether its going to be structured
in a way to do what it needs to dois that potential output in the forecast period is likely to fall
trend growth rates are coming down and i expect productivity to fall perhaps even more than in the
greenbook projection  the vaunted resilience of the us economy which ive talked about for a
long time is certainly going to be tested during this period  business investment it strikes me will
be a useful gauge as we get into the first quarter of 2009 to see how tough an economic period we
have in front of us and i worry about the decisions that business people will be making  now of
course against all of this markets could snap back as we saw a little yesterday2009 could look
better  we have to remain open minded about the possibility that the economy will continue as it
has over the past ten or fifteen years to outperform modelbased expectations
let me turn to foreign growth  these decouplers which were so prominent for so long are
somehow hard to find these days  foreign growth strikes me as likely to fall faster and stay lower
than in the greenbook projection  the road back is not likely to begin as early as the first quarter of
2009 for our major trading partners  the more financial fallout alternative simulation strikes me
as significantly more likely for foreign growth  in light of a growth trajectory that is better here in
the united states than outside the united states at least relative to current market expectations id
expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar on balance to strengthen against a basket of foreign
currencies
so let me turn finally to inflation  the trend on import prices the broad measures of
commodity prices and the expected dollar strength all suggest that inflation problems are abating
markedly  i think an open question which isnt likely to be dispositive but is likely to be
interesting is how sticky prices are particularly from the consumer product companies during this
periodhow long the various surcharges and increases in prices weve seen can stay high and the
companies attempt to keep profit margins  my guess is that they can make profit margins look
decent for another quarter or two but beyond that prices across a broad set of products and services
are likely to retrace some of the gains in recent periods  ill save the balance of my remarks for the
next round  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  well the autumnal bonfires have really sort of heated up
since the last fomc meeting  i think we have evidence in the united states and now worldwide of
what emerging market literature calls sudden stopsa sudden stopping of the flow of capital the
socalled flow of hot money into latin america or other countries and the devastating impact that
could have when suddenly credit is no longer available  ive been talking about the slow burn of the
problems in the credit markets but i think we saw that move up to a different level globally over the
past six weeks  this is the concern that we had earlier in the year about a regime shift  we seem to
have moved from a growth regime to a slidingbywithsomegrowth regime and now to a
contractionary one and the nonlinear effects that we had been concerned about
as we always say its particularly difficult to predict where the economy is going to go
but theres evidence of why its so difficult because almost any measure of volatility is up
dramatically  thats true on the financial market side on the real side as well as just in movements
of consumer confidence  so i think that we can say with some confidence that it is particularly
difficult to predict which way things are going to go  as many people have said before a few
spreads have come down but given the extent of our actions and those of other governments around
the worldcentral banks fiscal authorities et ceterait is surprising that there has been so little
effect
now maybe its just because so much is going on that theres a fair amount of confusion
and uncertainty about what the programs mean how they will actually be implemented and to
whom they will be applied  i think thats perhaps part of the reason for some of the spreads not
coming down with respect to interbank borrowingthere is a lack of clarity about exactly how the
fdic program will operate and exactly how the tarp will operate  well hear more about that in
a bit but i think its going to take time for people to feel confident about how that will work  also
i think there is real uncertainty because after thirty days some banks may not get the guarantees or
may have the guarantees pulled back  i think there is also a lot of uncertainty about who will get
tarp funding and who is qualified for tarp funding  as information comes out about people not
being qualified or markets being concerned that individual institutions are not going to be qualified
that could put on a lot of pressure  unfortunately thats going to be coming in addition to the end
oftheyear pressures  so i see a number of looming risks particularly in the financial services
sector as we fully implement and clarify some of the programs that i think on balance can be
helpful but that can actually cause some uncertainty at individual institutions  others have also
mentioned broader challenges in the emerging markets and the insurance companies and certainly
we have the hedge fund redemptions that are looming  im very concerned about trying to get over
the end of the year with so many different pieces putting additional pressure on  even some of the
pieces that we thought would be helpful potentially have a lot of downside risk to them
but even if we get through thisand the government guarantee programs the special
liquidity facilities and the negative real rates that we have and potentially may make even more
negative would provide some supportthe fundamental uncertainty is not going to be resolved until
we see what is going to work in the financial sector whats going to be the successful business
model and what are going to be the new sets of activities that can be undertaken  will certain
funding markets come back and at what spread once you take away all these special programs
until that is worked out i dont see how the markets can figure out who will survive and who
wont who is going to be there in three months and who isnt  i think that the programs are very
valuable in providing a time outa time for people to reassess  but until theres greater clarity in
those financing markets going forward i dont think the markets will actually be able to recover
that why the alternative simulation that puts things off a bit more seems quite sensible to me
some specifics on consumption  as i often do i talked with some of the largest providers
of consumer credit in the united states  they are reporting exactly as governor kohn said that
consumption or spending growth was decelerating through the summer but it did seem to get much
more rapid in september and october  one of the large companies actually reported significant
contraction on the consumer side of spending  on the small business side it was still positive but
down from doubledigit growth in the second quarter to basically flat  they also looked across
income categories  this is not a phenomenon of just the people at one or the other end of the
spectrum  it seemed to be across the board for what they looked at  all of them have reported just
as the senior loan officer opinion survey did a significant reduction of credit lines  so even if
were not seeing credit in and of itself having contracted yet the ability to get credit down the line is
going to be much much more difficult  also the funding markets for the credit card companies
have effectively closed  they may reopen  things may come back but i think its going to take
time for that to happen and they were certainly not optimistic about that
as virtually everyone has mentioned inflationary pressures for a variety of reasons are
much lower and i think that fits into what the vice chairman said about thinking about the costs of
moving now and perhaps moving too quickly  there seem to be lower costs now in being a bit
more aggressive than lets say six months ago because much less inflationary pressure seems to be
out there  i think a prudent riskmanagement point of view would certainly take into account those
costs and benefits  we need to use our monetary policy tools as effectively as we can and then
work with the other tools that a number of others have mentioned to try to get the markets to be
more comfortable with where things will go and then be able to lend to each otherto have the
unlocking of the credit markets without government guarantees without negative interest rates and
without extraordinary liquidity facilities  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i focused on the more rapid financial
recovery scenario not so much because i thought it was the most likely but just trying to think
what it would take to bring that about  im not sure that the policy changes we have done
recently will do that but i am fairly certain that we are going to keep at it until we find
something that restores confidence
i was shocked when i was looking at the bluebook at how short a time has passed since
the meltdown of all these major financial institutionsfannie freddie lehman aig wamu
and wachovia  there is a sense among those who were affected who lost from it that they just
really didnt see it coming at least not at this speed and that all of them had adequate regulatory
capital and the bankers at least were used to watching a sort of gradual burndown of that capital
before institutions failed  they had a sense of being unable to predict who was going to be
saved who was going to get whacked and who would be the winners and the losers  so
subsequently both the banks and their customers froze and there has been very little activity
since then  all the banks i talked to reported having stopped doing business with one or more
counterparties and that one or more counterparties had stopped doing business with them and
they were shocked by both of those things
so first and foremost it is clear that we need to restore confidence and predictability  in
this sense the recent moves to increase deposit insurance to guarantee interbank shortterm debt
and to provide capital on the same terms to banks of all sizes should be helpfulbut only as long
as we can do this without creating new uncertainty about who is going to benefit and who is not
without being too subjective or too cute we need at this point just to create confidence in our
entire system  the demonstrable and preemptive support of the nine largest financial
institutions our public support of aig similar support of globally important banks by their
home countries and the resolution of wachovia and national city the two largest troubled
institutions without loss should help us avoid shocking surprises while everybody calms down
in this light my conversation with the banks centered mostly on their reactions to the
recent policy changes  all thought the deposit insurance increase was helpful  they varied in
their estimates of the importance of the increase to 250000 with a lot of them pointing out that
for consumers they had already really restructured deposits to insure fairly large amounts and
several were using the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service program for
larger depositors  they were even more enthusiastic about the coverage of transaction accounts
although one banker felt as though this coverage really hadnt gotten as much visibility as it
should particularly with corporate treasurers and many had already seen corporate and
institutional deposits move into treasuries and felt as though it was going to be difficult to get
those back  there was even much more confusion about the guarantee of shortterm debt  one
banker questioned how they would know whether the fed funds sold to another bank actually fell
inside the 125 percent cap  another one thought that the allornothing structure of the guarantee
was a little difficult to work with  interestingly and as i pointed out yesterday when i asked
about interest on reserves nobody had even focused on it  they had bigger fish to fry  so i
wouldnt read anything into those early results
as for capital injections most were taking a hard look at it  two large community banks
had just issued private capital to support growth that had been attracted from competitors but
they thought that they could profitably deploy the new capital  other banks were interested in
having the capital just in case they had the opportunity to buy weaker competitors particularly
deposits or branches in problem resolutions  none was really concerned about the announced
restrictions but a number of them were somewhat suspicious of the possible restrictions that
might come later  some small banks with already high levels of capital somehow felt pressured
to apply anyway just to show that they would qualify although they didnt think it would give
them much growth  in all cases capital is only part of the story  they also need reliable funding
if they are going to expand lending  this will have to come either from reliable deposit growth
or from the reopening of secondary markets because all of them were reluctant to increase
borrowing from any source  the loantodeposit ratio is growing new fans  in terms of lending
all reported that they were still lending to their relationship customers and they were cutting
back on credit to creditonly customers  as one defined it if 90 percent of the revenue is coming
from credit then that was a customer relationship they wanted to exit
they still report no significant deterioration in the ci book  i asked about drawdowns
from companies and across the board they said they had seen it in a couple of instances but
really they had not seen an awful lot of that so that might be some posturing rather than actual
drawdowns on the credit  they are however exercising strong pricing discipline and the
pricing decisions more than credit decisions are being escalated up the approval chain actively
outreaching to customers that they want to keep and assuring them of credit availability  but
because they have no pricing power on the funding side and pricing became very skinny on loans
in recent years there is a high level of sticker shock going on which might explain some of the
complaints about unreasonable terms  they also report very high levels of caution from their
customers with the descriptions ranging from hunkering down to wait and see  there were
more anecdotal reports of companies riding trade credit by trying to accelerate receivables or
extend payables  now whether this is due to the actual or to the perceived unavailability of
credit from banks is not yet clear
real pressure is on commercial real estate lending  they are very selective in new
projects  they are processing renewals for only one year using the opportunity to shore up
pricing and underwriting and no longer writing miniperms  nobody is doing those  so far the
performance is holding up on commercial properties with strong performance on apartments and
weakness showing up in retail  residential construction and land development continues to be a
problem  in visiting the san francisco and the kansas city banks i was shocked to hear the
same story from large builders about land sales  one builder had a 300acre parcel with a cost of
75000 an acre listed it for 15000 an acre and sold it for 10700  another reported a
property with a cost basis of 120 million selling for 12 million  apparently the impetus for
both of these transactions was a judgment that the cash received from tax refunds was more
advantageous than holding out for better pricing  so the outlook for lending in residential
construction or commercial real estate is dim far into the future and i would say the same thing
for syndicated or participated lending  however to the extent that banks can exit those
segments it should free up funds for normal lending for businesses and consumers  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i would like to ask governor duke a question  do you
sense in this deep dive into the institutions that you talked to that they are benefiting from cuts in
the fed funds rate  are they enthusiastic or not about the prospect for a lower fed funds rate
ms duke  actually i have heard a couple of reports that when we did that last
50 basis point cut banks did not lower their prime  a lot of banks still have primerelated
credits  as we lower the rates whether it makes a difference on anything else it affects the
prime and there are still an awful lot of 5 percent cds out there  so as we lower rates we are
cutting into those margins and it is likely to turn some of them negative
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i would just echo that  i have heard the same thing from bankers in our
districtjust vociferous complaints about lowering rates because their loan rates go down but
their cost of funds doesnt
mr fisher  mr chairman if i could just add one other thing  we are hearing more
and more about people switching to libor trying to shift their lending contracts to libor
rather aggressively obviously because they are higher rates  but im wondering if youre
picking that up as well
ms duke  well i dont know  but just as soon as they get them switched over there
maybe well be successful at bringing libor down
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  let me try to summarize all that i heard
today and yesterday and then ill try to add some new comments to that  the outlook for
economic growth appears to have deteriorated quite significantly since the last meeting  data on
consumer spending production and employment had weakened more than expected even before
the recent intensification of the financial crisis  over the past six weeks or so however financial
conditions have greatly worsened and risk aversion has increased despite actions here and
abroad to stabilize the banking system  equity values have declined sharply amid conditions of
low liquidity and extraordinary volatility
credit market conditions have improved modestly since the global actions to recapitalize
banks and guarantee their deposits assisted also by additional central bank liquidity actions
however in almost all credit markets spreads remain much wider maturities shorter and
availability more constrained than was the case before the intensification of the crisis  firms
face continued funding risk and rollover risk  banks have probably not reserved sufficiently for
the credit losses to come and hedge funds will be hitting their net asset value triggers in greater
numbers forcing them to liquidate assets  the duration of future financial turmoil is hard to
judge but it could be lengthy
the worst thing is that financial conditions appear already to have had a significant and
remarkably quick effect on activity and consumer and business expectations and plans  most
committee participants see us in or entering a recession and have marked down significantly
their expectations for nearterm growth or for the pace of the recovery  the difficulty of
predicting the course of the crisis or its effects on the economy has also increased forecast
uncertainty  in particular the ultimate effects of some major policy actions such as the creation
of the tarp and the bank guarantee are not yet known  uncertainty about future policy actions
as well as uncertainty about the economy has affected behavior in markets and the broader
economy
consumer spending has weakened considerably and probably fell sharply in the third
quarter reflecting in part a recessionary psychology  consumer durables such as automobiles
and discretionary expenditures have been particularly hard hit  this weakness reflects the same
set of negative influences on consumption that we have been seeing for a while now
compounded by losses of equity wealth and confidence effects on prices although lower oil
prices may provide some relief  the labor market continues to decline with many firms
reporting that they are cutting back workers  the housing sector has not been noticeably worse
than expected and reports are somewhat mixed  but on a national basis the contraction is
continuing and recent developments in the economy and credit markets are likely to have
adverse effects  inventories of unsold new homes remain high putting pressure on prices
nonresidential construction continues at a moderate pace but backlogs are falling and the sector
is looking increasingly vulnerable to weakening fundamentals and tighter credit conditions
whether a new fiscal stimulus package will be passed and to what extent such a package would
be helpful remain open questions  manufacturing production has weakened significantly as have
expectations of demand including export demand  credit is becoming more of a problem for
many firms and their customers  spending on equipment and software appears to have slowed
reflecting greater pessimism and uncertainty  falling commodity prices may reduce mining
activity and cool the boom in agriculture  on the plus side firms are reporting fewer cost
pressures and inventories do not appear excessive
deterioration in global growth expectations has been marked  industrial economies had
already shown signs of slowing and they have been hit hard by recent financial developments
emerging market economies until recently evidently not much affected by the us slowdown
have in recent weeks also been hit hard by the spreading financial crisis  together with the
stronger dollar these developments are likely to restrain future growth of us exports
inflation risks have declined materially reflecting the fall in the prices of energy and
other commodities the stronger dollar and the prospect of considerable economic slack  firms
report much reduced pricing power and lower markups  inflation expectations have come down
both in the surveys and in the tips market though it wasnt notedbut i will notethat the
tips market is distorted by illiquidity and other problems there  most participants see both
overall and core inflation moderating in the coming quarters toward levels consistent with price
stability with some seeing a risk of undesirably low rates of inflation  some note however that
financial dislocations affect aggregate supply as well as aggregate demand and may reduce the
extent to which slower growth damps inflation  so thats just my sense  any comments
additions
let me make just a few additional comments none of which will be radically different
from what we have already discussed  i do think it is overwhelmingly clear that we are now in a
recession and that it is going to be a severe one  to give some sense of perspective the postwar
record for duration is 16 months  if the nber sets this experience as having begun early this
year i think we have a reasonable chance to break that record  the largest increase from peak to
trough in unemployment rate was in 1981  it was 36 percentage points  starting from
44 percent i think we have a chance to come close to that number  yesterdays drop in
consumer confidence in one month from 61 to 38 shattered the previous low of 43 in december
1975  so i think we are talking about an episode here that could easily be among the largest
postwar recessions
we dont know how things would have evolved without the developments in september
but obviously we have to deal with that reality  it was just a few weeks ago that we were dealing
with what might have been a true systemic crisis in the week leading up to the g7 and imf
meeting  i think it has been very fortunate that europe the united states and other countries
have adopted vigorous responses to that including bank capitalization bank guarantees and
other measures  that has been very important in calming the situation somewhat and reducing
the systemic aspects of investor concerns  that being said concern about counterparties remains
very strong  risk aversion is intense spreads remain high and i think that this has now become
really pervasive  it isnt just a question of junk bonds and weak borrowers or weak credit
histories  the spreads on gse debt on highgrade corporate debt and other areas have also
widened leading to a very broad based tightening in credit conditions  so i think that overall
any reasonable reading of financial conditions suggests that the tightening of credit or financial
conditions in the last six weeks or so has been quite substantial and overwhelms the effects of
our coordinated rate cut
now normally you would expect to see a tightening of credit conditions affect the
economy with some lag  it takes time for people to borrow money and to use the money they
borrow to make expenditures  but compared with that prediction we have instead seen a sudden
stopa remarkable and very rapid effect on economic activity  it is possible this is due less to
the direct effects of credit availability and more to the psychological impact of these events  one
possible analogy is the 1980 carter credit controls when the government announced what
seemed to be a tightening of credit  there was a very sharp response in economic activity
probably based more on expectations than on actual credit availability  unfortunately the credit
controls could be removed by government fiat we are not able to do that today
one interesting development is that the labor market has not yet shown as much
weakness as one would expect  unemployment insurance claims and other indicators do not yet
show a marked deterioration  i expect that we will see more deterioration of the labor market
besides the intensification of the financial crisis that has markedly increased the
restrictiveness of financial conditions i think the other very important development since our last
meeting has been the internationalization of the crisis  we had already seen weakening in
europe before the most recent intensification but it has become much more severe  there is
little doubt that the united kingdom and europe are in or about to enter recession  my sense is
that their monetary policy responses will be stronger than what the greenbook anticipates  i
believe they will be very aggressive in responding to that
a new and particularly worrying development is the fact that the crisis has now spread
beyond the industrial countries to the emerging markets  the g7 weekend was quite an
interesting one  it was a striking experience  i heard over and over again from the indians from
the brazilians and from all over the world that until the middle of september we were fine we
were not being much affected we didnt see much effect on our trade flows and suddenly
everything changed and now we are under severe stress  we are seeing tremendous outflows
our currencies are plummeting  commodity price declines are hurting many countries  i think
that is going to be a very significant development as we go forward
just to give some data in just a few weeks the embi spread the emerging market
sovereign debt spread went from 280 basis points to 850 basis points and the emerging market
equity index has fallen about 40 percent since the last meeting  it is not obvious that these
changes were justified by economic fundamentals  many of these countries are very well run
and had shown a lot of progress in their domestic policies and their domestic economies
instead i think they are suffering contagion from us mostly  unfortunately the implications of
this will be not only the usual trade and commodity price type of implications but also and even
more important financial implications  we are now seeing that the adverse feedback loop
which weve been talking about for a long time in the united states is becoming a global
phenomenon  in particular european banks are very heavily exposed to emerging market debt
so we are going to see yet more of this interaction between the financial markets and the broader
economy except at a global rather than a national level  these developments obviously are
very disturbing and dont bode well for us growth or now for global growth  somewhat
ironically all of this deterioration in the global outlook has led the dollar to appreciate very
sharply which is interesting to say the least  for us that obviously also has important
implications for inflation and as governor kohn mentioned it means that we will be less a
recipient of foreign strength and more a supporter of foreign weakness than we have been until
now
on inflation i know there is some discomfort in talking about a 1 percent policy rate and
promising to keep it low for a protracted periodand all those things  we have seen this movie
before and i think we all have to recognize the importance of watching the implications of that
for our economy and for asset prices and to take quite seriously the responsibility for removing
accommodation in a timely fashion once the crisis has begun to moderate  that being said i
dont think that there is really any case in the near term to be worrying very much about
inflationor perhaps even less so the dollaras we look at our policy  pricing power is
evaporating  and given what is happening in the global economy i dont see a commodity price
boom any time soon although i think as the economies do begin to recover in the next year or so
that we might see some recovery in commodity prices
so i think that as everyone has indicated this is a very worrisome situation  i dont think
we have control of it  i dont think we know what the bottom is so we have to remain very
flexible and very open to new initiatives as they become necessary  there has been some
comparison of this to the japanese situation  im beginning to wonder if that might not be a
good outcome  the advantage of the japanese was first of all that they were isolated  the rest
of the world was doing okay and they were able to draw strength from their exports and the rest
of the global economy  although they had very slow growth they never really had a deep
recession or big increases in unemployment  i think we are looking at perhaps a much sharper
episode and our challenge will be to make sure that it doesnt persist longer
i do think that one lesson of both japan and the 1930s as well as other experiences is that
passivity is not a good answer  we do have to continue to be aggressive  we have to continue to
look for solutions  some of them are not going to work  some of them are going to add to
uncertainty  i recognize that critique  i realize its a valid critique  but i dont think that this is
going to be a selfcorrecting thing anytime soon  i think we are going to have to continue to
provide support of all kinds to the economy  let me stop there and unless there is any question
or comment ask brian to introduce the policy round
mr madigan7  thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the version of table 1 that was distributed to you on monday  it is reproduced in the package before you labeled material for briefing on monetary policy alternatives  changes in the language relative to the bluebook version are shown in blue
starting on the righthand side of the table even though members saw the economic and financial information that became available over the intermeeting period as worse than expected they might be inclined to leave the stance of policy unchanged at todays meeting as in alternative c  as noted yesterday your

7  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 7
economic projections reveal that many of you anticipate that inflation pressures will diminish less quickly than the staff anticipates and several of you noted explicitly that you thought less easing would be appropriate than was assumed in the greenbook forecast  also the committee already reduced rates in early october responding to at least some of the adverse economic news  moreover the federal reserve has put in place additional facilities to support credit intermediation and the treasury and the fdic are moving quickly with the implementation of other programs that should with time help stabilize financial institutions and markets and enhance the flow of credit to households and businesses  finally you might believe that the congress is likely to enact a second fiscal stimulus package possibly reducing the need for additional monetary policy accommodation
the rationale section of the statement suggested for alternative c would acknowledge the intensification of financial turmoil and the weakening of the economic outlook  however it would also cite the range of policy actions taken in recent weeks as factors that should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth  the language on inflation would be essentially identical to that used in the committees statement earlier this month noting that the upside risks to inflation have been reduced  the risk assessment would state explicitly that the committees primary concern is the downside risks to growth suggesting a predilection for lowering rates  nonetheless with market participants anticipating an easing todaya 50 basis point move is seen as most likelyan announcement along the lines of alternative c would point to a much higher trajectory for the federal funds rate over the next few months than investors had expected  short and intermediateterm treasury yields would likely jump credit spreads probably would increase further and equity prices might decline sharply
if the committee is of the view that further policy accommodation is appropriate at this time but is also quite uncertain about the extent of rate reductions that will ultimately be required it might be attracted to the 25 basis point easing of alternative b at this meeting  members might have a less pessimistic outlook for the economy than that presented as the baseline in the greenbook or might at least be quite uncertain as to the extent of the negative forces at work in the economy  at the same time you may view the incoming information as suggesting that the 50 basis point easing earlier this month is unlikely to be sufficient to adequately balance the risks to economic activity and inflation  given these considerations you might see modest further easing today as appropriate and be prepared to cut rates again in coming months should developments warrant
the statement proposed for alternative b would note that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly and it would repeat language from your early october statement indicating that the financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending  the announcement would also indicate that in light of the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability  as noted in a box in the bluebook we think that in view of your previous policy
communications outside analysts would interpret such a statement on the inflation outlook as indicating that the committee anticipates that overall inflation will drop to around 1 percent to 1 percent before long a indication that would be consistent with the central tendency of your inflation projections for 2009  the risk assessment in alternative b paragraph 4 would cite the same broad range of policy actions that was proposed in alternative c paragraph 2  it would indicate that the predominant concern of the committee is the downside risks to economic growth  market participants see a 25 basis point easing at this meeting as possible but at this point they seem to place significantly higher odds on a 50 basis point reduction  the explicit citation of downside risks to growth would suggest that further easing could be forthcoming after this meeting but this announcement still would suggest a higher path for the federal funds rate than they anticipate  consequently short and intermediateterm rates might tend to edge up after such an announcement credit spreads might widen somewhat further and equity prices might decline
under alternative a the committee would ease policy 50 basis points at this meeting  an economic outlook along the lines of the greenbook forecast would provide one rationale for choosing this alternative  the greenbook forecast for aggregate demand has been slashed dramatically importantly reflecting a sharp decline in equity prices a steep rise in credit risk premiums and a considerable climb in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  one metric for this revision is the greenbookconsistent measure of the shortrun equilibrium real interest rate r which has been cut nearly 3 percentage points since the september meeting to a level of about minus 3 percent  that level is about 2 percentage points below the actual real funds rate defined on a consistent basis  the staff outlook for a protracted period of substantial economic slack together with the recent plunge in energy prices points to a considerable diminution of inflation pressures with overall inflation falling to 1 percent next year in the greenbook forecasteven with the greenbooks assumption of 100 basis points of further easing by early next year  but even those who are somewhat less pessimistic about the outlook than the board staff might view the modal outlook as having deteriorated enough or the downside risks as having increased enough to warrant a 50 basis point rate cut today
the rationale language for alternative a in the revised version of table 1 is similar to that for alternative b but alternative a paragraph 2 notes additional factors that are restraining growth  the risk assessment too is similar to that for alternative b but it references the rate reduction that would be implemented today under this alternative and notes that downside risks to growth remain without saying that the downside risks are the committees predominant concern  an announcement along these lines seems largely consistent with market participants expectations and the market reaction would likely be relatively small  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions for brian  all right  if there are no
questions why dont we begin our goround  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i think that this is a tough call  i support
alternative b with the statement wording as presented  in my thinking a 25 basis point cut
today is part of a total 75 basis point action including the october 8 move  i believe the
deterioration we have seen in september and october and the resulting downward revision of the
outlook merit a cumulative response of this magnitude  that said i am sympathetic to the view
that we would be well advised to keep some powder dry to respond to shocks or developments
ahead  i anticipate that because a number of the dynamics in the markets have not really played
out we will have more shocks and they could come from further financial institution failures
corporate failures a sovereign debt crisis and market disarray and in other markets such as the
municipal market there is always a chance of a geopolitical event  in all likelihood these things
come in combination or in rapid fire  so as i said i am sympathetic to the powder dry view
but i see the powder dry objective as being in conflict with responding to the recent
deterioration  therefore i come to 25 basis points or alternative b to some extent as a
compromise combined with the 50 basis points of october 8  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative a a 50 basis point cut in
the funds rate  this action and even more is justified by the dramatic developments since our
last meetinga deepening of the recessionary outlook worldwide the near meltdown of the
global financial system and the abatement of inflationary pressures  frankly it is time for all
hands on deck when it comes to our policy tools and the fed funds rate should be no exception
although we cut the funds rate 50 basis points a few weeks ago the greenbook inflation
projection was revised down more than that so the ex ante real funds rate actually edged up over
the intermeeting period
we need to do much more and the sooner the better  one might argue against such a
policy move in favor of a waitandsee approach to better gauge if the recent flurry of policy
initiatives will turn things around  in normal times i would have some sympathy for this
argument but these are about as far from normal times as we can get  we are in the midst of a
global economic and financial freefall and the confidence of households businesses and
investors is in shambles  the adverse feedback loop is playing out with a vengeance  lenders
continue to ratchet up terms and standards sapping the ability of households and businesses to
spend  as the economy weakens further loan defaults will mushroom
i think strong clear action is needed  historical precedents such as the case of japan
teach us that it is a mistake to act cautiously as the economy unravels  i think the clear lesson
from both economic theory and realworld experience is to lower rates as quickly as possible to
avoid a deeper and more protracted recession not to keep our powder dry or to wait to use tools
until later if they are available to us now  the more medicine we give and the sooner we give it
the better  the bluebook optimal policy simulations tell us that absent the zero bound the funds
rate should be lowered well below zero next year  since that is not an option we should do the
most with what weve got and cut the funds rate aggressively now
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like president yellen i support alternative a
the 50 basis point cut  i think its the right response to the very very substantial change in the
economic outlook since the last meeting  we would have cut the nominal federal funds rate by
1 percentage point and real federal funds rates by something less than 1 percentage point
depending on what you think is happening to inflation expectations  but surely inflation
expectations are coming downand coming down substantially
i think the incoming information the weakness before the shock hit in midseptember
which to me suggests that we didnt have any insurance against that weakness at the time the
extraordinary tightening of financial conditions and the downshift in spending that weve seen
since midseptember all suggest that a 1 percentage point cut in the real rate and even a little
less than a 1 percentage point cut would seem a very modest and moderate response to the
shock  its probably a down payment  if the staff is right we will need more  i built more into
my own forecast  but even if the economy is not as weak as the staff has built into the
greenbook i think a substantial cut in the federal funds rate is entirely appropriate
all of uswithout exception i thinksaid that there were downside risks to their
forecasts and a number of us have cited the possibility of a very deep recession here  so i think
we need to take action  we are starting with a situation in which the economy is declining  we
are in recession  the unemployment rate is rising  inflation is falling  there is a global
recession in train  it seems to me from a riskmanagement perspective that the costs of not
doing enoughthe costs of being reluctant to lower rates and making that situation worseare
far larger than the costs of going a little too far because things turn around faster  i think we are
in a situation in which it is almost impossible at this point to go too far  mr chairman we may
have to take it back at some point in the future but right now i think the 50 basis points is
absolutely justified by the conditions in which we find ourselves
i was drawn as the vice chairman was to the staff simulation having to do with a more
rapid financial recovery  i myself think thats a very small probability  but even if thats what
happens well know by december whether the financial markets are recovering faster  we can
stop at 1 percent if were getting that recovery and the outcomes as the vice chairman noted
really arent that bad in that recovery  so i think that even the small probability of a very sharp
turnaround in the markets is still consistent with cutting rates another 50 basis points at this
meeting
the fact that we are already low is not a reason to hold back  i dont agree with the
keeping the powder dry kind of argument  i think the lessons of history including from japan
are that the closer you get to the zero lower bound the more aggressive you should be  if you let
weakness build that weakness will overwhelm your policy tools  the most effective use of the
limited scope for policy easing is to be preemptive and stop weaknesses from building
i think a 50 basis point easing will have beneficial effects  i dont think that the markets
will react very much  we wont see those beneficial effects  but if i can compare it with doing
25 or nothing at all i think doing 25 or nothing at all would have adverse effects  with 25 or
nothing youll get longerterm rates up youll get stock prices down and youll get an erosion
of confidence at a time when we dont need itthat the central bank doesnt get how serious this
situation is  i agree that the last easing was largely offset by the loss of confidence and the rise
in uncertainty  i also agree that it might not feed through as directly and completely as it often
does because banks are trying to rebuild and lenders are trying to rebuild profit margins  but i
still think it will be effective  as i say i convinced myself of that by asking about what would
happen with the alternatives and i think the alternatives would be far worse  we need to keep
finetuning the tarp and the liquidity provision  we need fiscal stimulus  i agree with all of
that  we need to move on lots of dimensions  but these things will not be sufficient in and of
themselves to counter this  monetary policy is a fairly blunt instrument but we need to stimulate
the spending wherever we can to do this
some have expressed concern about circumstances forcing us to ease between meetings
we have done 50  will that take us further  i think we need to make clear in our statement and
our minutesparticularly in our minutesthat we do expect a weak economy going forward at
least a moderately softer economy and that the process may call for further easing  i think it will
call for further easing at the next fomc meeting but we can get to the next fomc meeting and
see  but it should take a substantial and unexpected deterioration relative to that path to justify
an intermeeting action  so i think we are absolutely right to have a prejudice toward taking
actions at meetings when we can sit around and discuss things  the odds are high that we will
need to go further but we should do that at a meeting if we can  if we do have a very strong and
substantial deterioration even relative to our weak outlook and we do end up moving between
meetings surely that move would not put us at a level that is unjustified by the circumstances
so i think we can deal with the intermeeting situation and not have the pressures of the market
the pressures of expectations get us to a level at which were ultimately uncomfortable  in short
i think its a very serious situation  we need to do all we can to counter this situation  now is
not the time to hold back  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  like the greenbook forecast our forecast predicts a significant
recession  further easing will likely help mitigate the severity of the recession  coupled with
improvements in shortterm credit spreads a reduction in the federal funds rate should lower
rates on home equity lines of credit as well as business and consumer rates tied to libor easing
cash flow for consumers and businesses  we are facing problems of historic proportions both
here and abroad  a 50 basis point easing as in alternative a is both necessary and appropriate
even with the easing assumed in the greenbook the unemployment rate remains too high for too
long  the inflation rate falls enough to be well below my target  to avoid a severe and
prolonged recession we will very likely need further monetary easing and a significant fiscal
package even after this 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
i would just note in terms of the language that although i am comfortable with the
alternative a language my actual views would be closer to saying the predominant concern of
the committee is the downside risk to growth rather than nevertheless downside risks to
growth remain
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  after thinking about this for quite some time
i cannot convince myself that alternative a is not the right way to go
mr kroszner  let the transcript reflect that  laughter
mr evans  you were very effective in listing a number of dire circumstances  the
fact that we may challenge the maximum duration of a recession in the postwar period any
mention of the 198182 recession is very frightening you even mentioned 1975 in terms of the
reduction in confidence and the 1980 credit crunch alsoyou were able to do that without any
mention of the 1930s and thats quite compelling i would say
so for the reasons that have been already discussed the outlook is quite unfavorable and
i think that this will help improve matters  but as i thought about the concerns that i have one
concern is whether this will actually be viewed as effective today  im not sure about that  the
last time we cut rates financial stress intervened to swamp any beneficial interpretation of that
whether that affects our credibility i think that don kohn was very effective in mentioning that
there will be credibility hits in the other direction if we dont take some action like that  i do
think that eventually things will subside and the beneficial effects of lower policy will be seen
about the dry powder argument we are not going to have many more actions left after this but i
dont see what the alternatives are other than to go ahead and put this in place  i dont subscribe
to the view that inflation is likely to be too low although that is a risk  inflation concerns the
financial stress all of those issues even taking into account the risk that president bullard
mentioned the other day i think speak strongly to the fact that were running out of normal
monetary policy options and that fiscal actions are going to be strongly important  so i do favor
alternative a  thank you
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  well mr chairman i certainly understand how serious this matter is
and i guess i am of the view that alternative a is not going to solve much  there is a
psychology i understand in the market that is going on and i am not convinced that our
continuing to take these actions and then having adverse outcomes is necessarily going to inspire
confidence  i think we need to let our actions work their way through  part of the problem is
that the credit mechanism is stuck right now because of the tremendous uncertainties  then i
look at all of the things we have done over the last month and the ramping up of the liquidity
facilities has really exceeded even our ability to sterilize  so we have had in effect a funds rate
that is well below our target  we have excess reserves in that period that were over 280 billion
when they are normally 2 billion and that was before we added more swap lines and more
liquidity into the market  frankly i think we are at a point now where the liquidity mechanisms
that were trying to use not our interest rate targeting are really our monetary policy  as we go
forward perhaps we need to think about how we are going to conduct monetary policy under a
quantitative easing environment  that is what i think we will effectively be at if we move again
today  so how we think about liquidity and about the credit mechanisms is really where more of
our attention will have to be spent  lowering the rate may have some positive effects but i
doubt it  so i would just stay where we are let some of these past actions begin to work through
and see what the effects of those are before we then take another move because i think the
market would just appreciate some stability over time in our actions so that they can see these
things begin to work  it isnt a problem of the interest rate level right now in my opinion so
thats why i would wait and see  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  clearly forecasts have been marked down
since our september meetingmine included  this reflects the weaker data that we have
obtained on the real side especially consumer spending and manufacturing but also worsening
conditions in the financial markets  accordingly in an intermeeting move on october 8 we cut
the funds rate 50 basis points  yet the additional effect on the economy of financial turmoil
during the last month remains highly uncertain  spreads in many markets remain higher than at
the time of our september meeting but some have started to decline  if our new facilities have
the desired impact we may well see spreads continue to fall back to september or lower levels
it is very difficult to say at this time  although i dislike intermeeting rate cuts i supported the
october 8 cut because it was part of a coordinated effort among central banks around the world
and it seemed justified given that our growth outlook had deteriorated and inflation expectations
had remained stable
we may well have to do more but i think we are near the end of what we can do with
monetary policy  of course its difficult to determine the appropriate level of the funds rate and
i want to draw your attention to the greenbook which showed that whether we cut today or
dont cut today the paths of gdp employment and inflation over the next year or two are not
much different  in fact in most models cuts of that magnitude do not show up very heavily in
real variables  i would also note that according to the greenbook we could cut the rate to zero
and have no effect on inflation apparently for the next four years  however given the fact that
rate cuts dont have much effect even in the greenbook simulations we have cut rates  it may
not make much difference as president hoenig was saying  my preference at this meeting
would be to stand pat and see how the data and financial markets improve  we are already
engaged in extraordinary quantitative easing even at this point and we are hearing from bankers
that the funds rate will do little to stimulate lending on their part or improve their balance sheets
now delaying necessary rate cuts is not desirable  but given the considerable uncertainty
around our forecast it is not clear that further cuts are either necessary or desirable or are going
to be effective  and doing so for purely psychological reasons from my standpoint is a dubious
way to conduct policy
a comparison of the baseline greenbook forecast with the alternative scenario involving
morerapid improvement in financial conditions suggests that the appropriate policy path is very
much dependent on knowing whether the increase in financial stress in september will be
lasting  if conditions deteriorate further which they might we may want to cut in december  if
conditions improve this may not be necessary  given the decline in confidence in our markets
and institutions i think the fed can play a positive role by being a steadying hand  thats
another reason to wait a bit longer before moving again
i do not believe that we inspire confidence by appearing to react to market fluctuations
even though thats not what were doing i fear that we often give that appearance  moreover
although we have gotten positive reactions to the creativity of our liquidity programs i think we
have missed opportunities for raising confidence by rolling out our liquidity facilities in a
piecemeal fashion  we had announcements made every day between monday and wednesday
on october 6 7 and 8  i think it would have been far better to announce these actions as a well
thoughtout package explaining the intention of the individual pieces and how they related to
one another  for example we now have three different lending programs designed in whole or
in part to support money market mutual funds  i have concern that we have been looking
reactive rather than proactive even though i know that some of these programs had been in the
works for a while
i have argued that it is important that we think about our policy choices in terms of policy
pathsthat is a dynamic path  the principles of dynamic programming suggest that we think
about our policies in a backwardlooking way  this i believe applies not only to monetary
policy but to our liquidity programs as well  in this spirit i believe that we must think hard
about our exit strategies both from the liquidity programs and from our very low funds rate  i
think we have dug ourselves a very deep hole in terms of the breadth and depth of our lending to
the private sector  we seem at times to be the lender of first resort as well as the lender of last
resort  we must make sure that we have a sturdy ladder that will enable us to climb our way out
of this hole  this is especially important given the interaction between the programs and the
differences across the programs in their current expiration dates
on the monetary policy side we have added significantly to liquidity in the economy as
i alluded to earlier  given the uncertainty surrounding our forecast we may very well find
ourselves in a position of having to reverse those injections sooner than expected  i am even
more concerned with this planning process than i have been when i have raised this point before
the baseline funds path in the greenbook is quite extraordinary from my perspective  it
suggests that we can keep the funds rate low below 1 and even close to zero throughout most of
the forecast period  indeed in 2011 the funds rate is still below 2 percent even though the
economy is growing at 44 percent  we may disagree somewhat on the magnitude of the
contributions of our low interest rate policies in the 200305 period to the current problems but i
dont think many of us want to repeat that episode  yet looking at the baseline forecast and
where the funds rate remainsbelow 1 percent or certainly below 2 percent for the next four
yearsit strikes me as a risky strategy at best and perhaps even a dangerous one  we have
previously expressed views around this table that this committee historically has been reluctant
to raise rates in a timely fashion and i believe that fear is reinforced by what i see in the baseline
forecast in the greenbook  that projection worries me a great deal  we must not act in a way
that sows the seeds of the next crisis
despite the pressure of the here and now we cannot and should not ignore the
consequences of our actions in the intermediate term  managing our way from point to point
dealing with immediate problems can very easily lead us to a place in which we do not wish to
bethus the importance of thinking in terms of a path  i think it would also serve us well to
think about the process we will follow to unwind our liquidity programs in advance so that we
avoid unintended consequences across markets and about the communication strategy that will
ease the transition back to a more market based provision of liquidity
in sum mr chairman although i would prefer not to move today i recognize that my
forecast is more optimistic than most  moreover i also accept the notion that there is a great
deal of uncertainty about the outcomes and fragility in the marketplace and your concerns are
well noted  thus i will not dissent against a 50 basis point cut  but i would like to remind the
committee of our earlier discussions and the general agreement i thought i heard that when the
time comes we will have to raise rates and we may have to do so aggressively  in all likelihood
that will occur before lagging indicators such as the unemployment rate are firmly on the
decline  this is not the projection offered in the greenbook baseline  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard you have a handout
mr bullard  i do have a handout
chairman bernanke  everybody have a copy  president bullard
mr bullard8  thank you mr chairman  i guess before i start i just want to say
that i generally agree with everything everyone is saying  this is a dire situation and i am
perfectly comfortable with that assessment  what i want to do with my comment here is just put
on the table one idea about why a rate reduction might be counterproductive  that is what im
trying to do here
the us economy now appears to be in recession  intensified financial market turmoil
and very fluid expectations have created a very difficult situation  a key question for the
committee is what to do with the monetary policy piece of the policy response to the situation
we know that monetary policy is a blunt instrument that does not directly address fundamental
problems in financial markets  we have other programs in place to try to address those problems
more directly  we also have important fiscal actions which are probably having the largest
effect in trying to stabilize the current situation  unlike the ecb we already lowered nominal
interest rates aggressively earlier this year in anticipation of the possibility of weak
macroeconomic performance  we are now in the middle of a further round of easing which is
threatening to send nominal interest rates to zero given the force of events
is this the optimal policy or could it backfire on the committee  i want to at least lay
out the possibility that a very low nominal interest rate policy may be counterproductive  my
key worry is that housing markets remain at the core of the current turmoil  mortgage markets

8  the materials used by mr bullard are attached to this transcript appendix 8
14 trillion or so about one gdpare based on nominal contracts  deflation tends to be very
destructive in an environment of nominal contracting  i want to stress that macroeconomic
expectations are very important for the way the economy actually evolves and will evolve going
forward and that those expectations are very fluid in the current environment  the japanese
experience while it is not an exact parallel represents an important reference point for the
current situation  japans problems were very real  some have described the outcome as a lost
decade
so lets turn to the graph here for just a second  this is what i was talking about
yesterday  this is an argument put forward by jess benhabib stephanie schmittgroh and
martn uribe  on the vertical axis is the nominal interest rate  on the horizontal axis are the
inflation rate and inflation expectations which in this graph are going to be the same thing  the
diagonal line labeled fisher is just a fisher relationship  the nominal interest rate is the real
interest rate r plus inflation expectations  then policy is described by the line with the kink in
it  the policy line means that when mediumterm inflation expectations are above target we
raise the nominal interest rate and when mediumterm inflation expectations are below target
we lower the nominal interest rate  that works beautifully around the targeted equilibrium the
 in this environment and all goes well  its just that when you go to low nominal interest
rates strange things start to happen because you have to do something with policy as you come
to very low nominal interest rates  you could just go to zero and then you would have the
horizontal line labeled policy that would go across all the way to the minus r there  or you
could stop at some earlier level  i chose something here to illustrate what the greenbook seems
to have in mind say  percent
but any way you cut it this is going to create another crossing of the fisher relation and
create a second steady state  this is the main point of the benhabib analysis  you can layer on
top all kinds of other stuff that you would like to include in your model but most models are
going to have a fisher relationship and most models are going to have the policymaker reacting
by adjusting the nominal interest rate  so this other steady state the steady state with low
nominal interest rates has deflation  if you get stuck there in our current environment this
would exacerbate the housing problem a lot and make our problems much more severe  so this
is just one caution about going to a very low nominal interest rate environment  when i saw this
six or seven years ago it had some influence on me  before this i was not worried about any of
the zero bound issues  but then this does make me a little nervous given the core problem in
our situation which is the housing problem  thats the argument  so let me set that aside then
one thing this line of research pointed outand a whole bunch of papers have been
written since this paperis the existence of this second steady state and that the deflation
associated with the trap steady state is a worrisome phenomenon  there are two steady states
here  you can just argue that you dont think the lower one is going to be the one the economy
coordinates on and that eventually we are going to go back to the high one and that is perfectly
fine  however the japanese case seemed to be zero nominal interest rates and a moderately low
rate of deflation for quite some time  you could say that if we coordinate on this low nominal
interest rate steady state we can somehow take fiscal policy actions to move off that to the other
steady state  that is a more complicated issue  that has been addressed in the literature and
that is also a reasonable thing to say  i guess my main concern about this is since it is a very
dire situation and i think we are going to go very close to zero very soon i want us to do it with
our eyes open  it has some possibility of creating a worse environment  that is the only thing i
wanted to say here
so my preference based on this would be to leave rates alone and say lets use fiscal
policy  i dont think what we have now is an interest rate problem  what we have now are
problems in credit markets and i think they are being fairly well addressed by the most recent
fiscal actions including capital injections into the banking sector  so that would be my
preference at this point
chairman bernanke  thank you  lets see president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman if you had kicked around in the streets of hong kong in
1997 then you would have wandered into elementary schools and seen what we called at that
time quotronschildren trading stocks on the lunchroom floor  it was the surest indicator
that the market was out of control  this morning i opened the wall street journal and on the
front page they describe an exercise run by the securities industry and financial markets
association which you know is wall streets biggest trade group with a similar program in
american schools  it says that a 13year old in wilmington delawaremichael ashworthis
slumped by his computer weary from another rough day in the stock market with all his favorite
picksdominos pizza the hershey company and gapsurprise  laughter  ill be honest
with you he confided before all this i asked my mom to give me stocks for christmas  but
then i told her not to do it  i asked for a parakeet instead  laughter  now this is not as
exotic or thoughtful a handout as the one from my colleague from st louis but heres the point
he may not get that parakeet because the pet store may not have access to credit  this is to me
the fundamental issue that i think president plosserand i wont repeat his argumentsand
president hoenig were referring to  the concern i have is not about the price of money  in fact
i think we are not seeing that kind of transmission mechanismgovernor duke gave testimony
to that earlier  all of us are aware that it is not moving as quickly through the iv tube as we
would like it to because of the crimped nature of the tube
i have no problem with the language in alternative a except for the first paragraph and
the phrase including todays rate reduction  i have an open mind  i do think the issue in terms
of restoring the system comes back to credibility and predictability  you cannot have a
functioning capitalist system if you have total uncertainty  these are the issues that i believe
president plosser president hoenig earlier president lacker and others were referring to in the
first intervention  i thank president geithner in particular for addressing the questions i asked
yesterday and there was reference to them earlier
we have done so much so quickly  we are in a quantitative easing period  the question
is whether it actually makes a difference if we cut rates or not and whether the price of money is
actually the issue or the fact that money is not flowing that there are counterparty risks and
rollover risks and all the things we have talked about at this table and each of us has articulated
in our public speeches  to be very honest with you mr chairman i am openminded about this
because i could make that argument both ways  if it doesnt matter why not cut 50 basis points
or why not hold  i am not convinced yetand id like to listen to the rest of the arguments
that alternative a in terms of the action is the right way to go  i do think its very important that
we be very clear and articulate in laying out how we see the world and i do believe that the
language in alternative a does the best job of all the columns that have been presented
but i come back to the question i asked before  what are the next steps  id like to
know  what is the end game  id like to know before i cast my vote  i will conclude with
actually once again agreeing with president yellen as i think i have done twice in history
laughter  the last time was at the last meeting  i think its very important that we have all
hands on deck that we have a unanimous decision  but still i would like answers to my
questions  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher i promised you answers and i will deliver
them  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i strongly favor alternative a a 50 basis
point cut in our fed funds target rate today  i think it is important for us to move aggressively
and quickly to offset the strong forces that are acting to depress economic activity  i know that
some prefer a more measured response especially as we move closer to the zero bound but the
lesson i take from history is that more and sooner is better than taking smaller steps over time
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the economic outlook has definitely
deteriorated  on top of the slowing at the beginning of the third quarter a sequence of policy
actions and statements has spread an inchoate fear  in response to that a wide variety of
economic agents have delayed outlays  the breathtaking credit market interventions that we
have undertaken in the last several weeks are going to make it hard to judge whether those
markets are stabilized  it is going to make it even harder to judge how and when to withdraw
governor duke asked rhetorically what it would take for recovery to begin  i think it is
not going to be a very healthy recovery unless we have made substantial progress toward
withdrawing these interventions  i know its probably premature in the midst of a crisis to be
talking about the recovery but a number of people did and i think it makes sense on the grounds
that president plosser advanced for us to be thinking ahead  president geithner talked about the
will and the desire and that it amounts to a matter of will to reverse course later on  i think that
in withdrawing these subsidies and these credit market interventions is where we are going to
need the will  it is going to be really hard to disenfranchise somebody who now has access to
one of these programs
the inflation outlook has improved  expected inflation has come down  a couple of
people have noted that  that brings the real rate where the interest rate is nowto about zero
so i can favor a 50 point reduction in the federal funds rate target at this meeting  i think a funds
rate that is in real terms as best as we can measure it about minus 1 percent is how we should
see our way through here at least in the near term  like president evans i will mention the
1930s  what i take from my reading of the great depression is that this is what central banks
should do in times like thiskeep real interest rates low
let me make a couple of brief observations  as i mentioned yesterday i think we are
going to face a challenge communicating about our strategy  if we need to reduce interest rates
to the lowest practical level to which we feel we can reduce them i think yesterdays discussion
suggests that the committee could use a refresher course on the monetary economics of the zero
bound  i applaud president bullard for his breaking new ground by providing a figure from the
journal of economic theory  laughter
i want to put something on the table about the federal funds rate  we are voting today on
the target for the federal funds rate  the way our operations are conducted now we are leaving
so many excess reserves in the system that we are driving the federal funds rate down to the
interest rate on reserves  the interbank risk premium is likely to become small as the fdic
guarantee becomes well understood and more broadly effective  the gses are likely to catch on
that they deserve more on their funds  small banks as governor duke says that havent really
paid attention to what this new regime is about are going to find that brokers are going to be able
to find them placements at closer to the interest rate on reserves  so i think that the sloppy
trading below the interest rate on reserves is going to fade over time  as long as we have excess
reserves at the scale that we do as long as the desk has added that many reserves we are going
to have the effective federal funds rate at the interest rate on reserves  because we are voting on
the federal funds target rate i think that the committee ought to have some understanding from
the staff that either excess reserves are going to be drawn down to the point that the effective rate
is lifted off the interest rate on the reserves floor orand this would be my preferable course of
actionwe raise the interest rate on reserves to equal the target rate  otherwise we are voting
on something but we are actually doing something else  i can understand the desire to err on the
side of soft rates  this is what we did in august 2007  but as rates go down we need to be
more and more careful about what the committee is actually voting on
chairman bernanke  just to support what you said we are obviously still trying
to find our way in how to use this in the new regime with the excess reserves interest rate  it is
possible that at some point we might decide to target that interest rate  that might be the most
straightforward thing to do  but as i understand itand in fact im quite confidentthe
intention of the staff and the board is to try to figure out what the relationship is between the
excess reserves interest rate and the federal funds rate as normally measured  if we can establish
a reliable relationship then we should try toand we willuse that to hit the target  its
coming close to it  we certainly are not trying intentionally to come under the target  if that
fails then we will go to what you are suggesting which is effectively what im saying and make
them the same  then effectively there is no difference between targeting the interest rate on
excess reserves and targeting the federal funds rate  we are certainly open to that and there is
no intention to do anything other than to try to figure out a way to take the fomcs decision and
put it into practice in the money markets  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well financial headwinds continue to be a
major part of my thinking about the economic outlook  reasonable people can differ about that
issue but it seems to me that the headwinds are significant and they are likely to persist
partially as a consequence and partially for other reasons the economic outlook has deteriorated
and the inflation outlook fortunately has improved  so i favor alternative a and i am satisfied
with the language associated with it
let me make just one additional comment  one way of thinking about lowering rates at
this juncture and its potential effectiveness is that it is important to reduce the price of liquidity
in this environment  i think thats what lowering the target would do  that said if i think about
policy a bit beyond this meeting i start with an observation that governor kohn made  we are
probably going to receive a batch of pretty negative economic news over the next several
months  at the same time a lot of programs are in place as everybody is aware and perhaps my
optimism is illconceived but i actually think that they have the promise of being effective over
time  so its not just a question in my mind of the nature of the news we get but are we also
seeing signs that all these programs are getting some traction and being effective  if they are
that ought to temper our desire to go further  obviously a lot of things are in play and a great
deal of uncertainty is present here and abroad  but we will simply have to assess all these
developments as best we can as time passes  i think ill end my remarks there
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me begin by agreeing with don kohn on
two things  this is the toughest economic period i can remember in his lifetime laughter and i
support alternative a  i think the inflation trends and the trends in the global economy give us
flexibility which six months or so ago i did not think we would have  i think that gives us some
degree of freedom that given all of the negative tone including my own around the table gives us
at least some source of comfort
next i would say that i agree with the consensus around the table which is that these
problems are not principally about monetary policy  but i also think that monetary policy isnt
irrelevant to this and all agencies of governments around the world are making tough decisions and
the marginal benefits of further monetary policy changes strike me as not high but not irrelevant  i
think president plosser talked a bit about the alternative policy paths in the greenbook that range
from keeping the fed funds rate constant where it is to taking it to zero percent and the surprisingly
small differences in output employment and core inflation there  in some ways in the discussion
that were having about 25 or 50 or moving or not it would not be fair for any of us to overstate the
importance in terms of directly affecting the economy in the short term
that goes to my final point which is that the most valuable asset that we have isnt what at
the end of this meeting might be 100 basis points left of monetary policy  frankly it is the
credibility of the institution and the credibility of the fomc  if i compare our credibility now to
virtually any other organization in the united states or maybe even globally i think our credibility
is holding up quite well particularly relative to the degree of difficulty we have in front of us
relative to the trauma in financial markets and the weaknesses in the economy  so it is that asset
that credibility that we need to continue to protect more than incremental basis point moves on the
fed funds rate  i think that credibility will be tested over this period as it will for our counterparts
we dont want to find ourselves in a corner come december or come a couple of brutal days in the
markets where we feel compelled to continue to act and make 50 basis point moves unless and until
we know where we want to end up on this  so im sympathetic to that point of view  we need to
tell the story before the story is told for us of what our lower bound is why its there and what our
diagnosis of the economy is  i think that the chairman and the rest of us will have ample
opportunity to do that between now and december and that it is quite important to make sure we
come out of this as strong as we have been through this period so far  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  well ive not been able to convince myself not
to agree with president evans  as everyone has said we have this very significant global shift that
has stepped down real activity and financial activity  the inflation environment has changed
dramatically from a number of months ago with the change in commodity prices the change in the
value of the dollar and the change in not just us but also global resource utilization  i think weve
seen just an enormous change there  also when you look at the expected federal funds rate path
we have to be careful in looking at anything in the markets these days because of liquidity risk
premiums or term premiums that were not quite sure aboutthe markets are expecting significant
cuts from us  they are not expecting any immediate or nearterm significant increases in inflation
and i think all of the indications are that it will be going down
in a costbenefit analysis the costs seem relatively low in terms of the potential for inflation
of doing this  now we have to think about it in terms of benefits and a number of people have
touched on the transmission mechanism  i do think that there are forces that mute the extent to
which a 50 basis point cut translates into 50 basis points or lower on costs but i dont think they
completely offset it  it still has the effect of reducing the cost of liquidity reducing many peoples
borrowing costs  i think it still does have an effect even if theres an offsetting risk spread and even
if theres an offsetting bank action that affects that  so in terms of costs and benefits at this time it
seems that the costs are relatively low or muted and the benefits are positive and potentially high
in particular as i mentioned before im concerned about the confluence of forces that may
make things very difficult around the end of the year  if you look at a lot of these libor or
forward markets theyre not coming down either in the united states or around the world  we
have a lot of uncertainties with hedge funds with the potential for other institutions getting into
trouble and with just the implementation of our policiesin particular as i mentioned the way the
fdic guarantee program and the tarp program work may end up singling out institutions and
bringing them down more quickly than otherwise  so i think it makes sense in terms of costbenefit
analysis even more so given the tail risk around the end of the year to act now  we have another
opportunity to act in december and obviously an opportunity to act at any point if we do see a
dramatic change  we are getting near as much as we can do but i dont see the costs of acting more
aggressively and more quickly here outweighing the benefits  so i support alternative a with the
language as drafted  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you  i confess i find myself torn between the position of president
plosser and the equally compelling arguments of governor kohn and that makes alternative b quite
attractive as a way not because of any optimism about the economic outcome but i really do
question the effectiveness of any move in the fed funds target given the actual trading of the fed
funds rate right now  when we set the interest rate on reserves at that point i was concerned that
our interest on reserves would disrupt the market for fed funds between banks because of the risk
premium  with the fdic insurance i think that goes away and so probably president lackers
suggestion deserves some strong consideration  i am also painfully aware of the operational and
financial difficulties that banks experience at a 1 percent fed funds rate and the likely difficulties of
other intermediaries as the absolute level of rates falls further
as i stated in my earlier remarks im also most concerned about the importance of
predictability in returning confidence to the markets and in that light i am concerned about market
expectations  but having recently been an expecter rather than a decider im going to suggest that
most of those doing the expecting dont understand at all the issues that weve discussed here today
theres a thought that if the fed funds rate just comes down it would maybe make this pain go
away  so i agree with governor warsh that the public statements in the intermeeting period and as
we approach the point where we simply cant meet market expectations anymore are critically
important to shape market expectations  so i do think its important that the markets focus on the
other efforts and with that i would support alternative a
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman i support alternative a both the action
and the language for the reasons i said earlier  i just want to make a couple of other points  i think
the only way to be predictable in a crisis like this is to be predictably inert or to be late  i dont
understand the basic argument that you add to confidence by being inert or by being late or as the
chairman said by being passive despite overwhelming evidence about changes in the outlook and
risks to financial stability  the argument that makes me most uncomfortable here around the table
today is the suggestion several of you have madeim not sure you meant it this waywhich is
that the actions by this committee contributed to the erosion of confidencea deeply unfair
suggestion
now a lot of things happened over the last three months and the last year and a lot of things
happened in terms of policy over the last six weeks  there is no doubt that communication about
policy by all the arms of the us government and the uncertainty created by the actions by all the
arms of the us government contributed in ways to uncertainty about the policy response going
forward  there is also no doubt that inevitably in a crisis like this when policy moves forcefully it
is scary because a lot of people are not yet at the point of assessing or understanding the forces
driving our decisions  but i think its just unfair to suggest that the actions by the chairman and this
committee were a substantial contributor to the erosion in confidence and to uncertainty about
further policy actions even though its true that when we move with force and drama it has the risk
of adding to uncertainty
id be very careful to look more broadly at the full range of other things that happened in
that period of time including for example the confusion established by the range of different
choices for interventions in lehman aig the gses wamu in particular and wachovia and what
that meant  look particularly at the damage to confidence created by the congresss actions in the
weeks after the legislation was first proposed  compare that for example with the announcement
effect of the initial thing  look also at the uncertainty created around what the package was
designed to do and how it was designed  but please be very careful certainly outside this room
about adding to the perception that the actions by this body were a substantial contributor to the
erosion in confidence  i think that don kohn said it best  the whole framing which seems to have
hardened now that the world ended with the lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic
truth  independent of whether there was an option available at the time the erosion in underlying
economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going
into august and early september  so i just offer that
you know everyone wants to quote fdr  fdr said at one point if i judge the mood of
the country right what this calls for is bold experimentation  i do not believe that this chairman
and this committee have been irresponsibly experimenting at the cost of predictability and
confidence going forward  what we have done is a relatively well designed series of escalations in
monetary policy and liquidity intended to be preemptive against what we knew was substantial risk
of a very adverse economic and financial outcome  the risks were not broadly shared not just in
this room but outside  but i think the judgments by the chairman were largely correct in weighing
those risks appropriately at that time and i think we all owe him a substantial amount of deference
for the judgments he made and his wisdom  both here in this room and in the effect he had on the
policy choices that the fiscal authorities also ultimately made look very good now and will look
even better over time as people understand how grave and substantial the risks were that we were
facing in the economy and the financial system
one last point to president fishers question  president fisher asked the obvious question
which is what next  i think a very good approach to decisionmaking is to say i dont want to
know so much about this  i want to know about the next three things  i know the chairman is
going to give a nice thoughtful and complete answer to this  but i would just say the following
we dont need to know today what is next on the monetary policy front  we know there may be
some arguments for going lower than 1 percent  we have to think through very carefully the
collateral damage consequence in terms of what that does to market functioning and behavior  we
have to look at the alternatives to that including in communication  a range of other policy options
are within our capacity to influence and effect that will give us the ability to minimize downside risk
going forward  but i dont think that we need to knowand we cannot know with precisionwhat
the optimal mix of those things is now before deciding what to do although im very sympathetic to
the basic judgment  the question really is in moving today are we going to do more harm than
good to our ultimate objective  its very hard to make the case that we do damage to any of our
basic fundamental objectives and mandate  i can see a much stronger case that we do a lot of
damage to those if we dont act today even though we all recognize that ultimately this is going to
require more than monetary policy to address the risk here
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  id just like to just take a moment to react  im not sure whom you heard
saying that the result was primarily a result of this committees actions or the chairmans actions or
anyone elses actions  if those were words you were putting in my mouth that was not what i said
president geithner  i do think i have been supportive of almost all the actions in terms of liquidity
facilities i supported the actions  i also was supportive of the lehman brothers decision  but i
think its a far cry from saying that uncertainty about policies contributes to uncertaintywhich you
agreed toits a far cry from that to saying we lay the blame at the feet of this committee or the
chairman  so i dont know what straw man you were setting up but it certainly didnt apply to this
member of the committee  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  let me just offer some thoughts that may
be somewhat more expansive than usual in response to the questions that have been raised  some of
this is extemporaneous so youll have to bear with me  let me first talk about the strategy we
pursued thus far and where we are and then think about where we might go as a country as well as
an institution going forward
without going through all of the familiar discussion about how the crisis began what the
sources of it were i think that the federal reserves responses are essentially three  first we were
relatively early and aggressive in our monetary policy easing particularly compared with other
countries  second we have been creative and expansive in our use of liquidity tools including a
wide variety of lending programs  third we have used our available but not always adequate tools
to try to stabilize systemically critical failing institutions and to try to mitigate systemic risk
without sounding too defensive i will try to argue that i think on all three of these we have
been more or less in the right direction  first on the early and aggressive monetary policy easing
obviously there was a lot of concerna lot expressed abroad that we were going to create a
stagflationary 1970s type of situation and that we were going to destroy the dollar and its role as an
international currency  our response essentially was that we thought that the increases in
commodity prices were mostly a relative price change induced by changes in real demand for
commodities and in the supply of commodities across the globe and that at some point those
commodity price increases would stabilize which would lead to a moderation of the inflationary
effects and concerns  it took longer than we had expected but once it began it was more
pronounced than we had expected  inflation has not become the problem that was anticipated by
many early on and the dollar of course is now stronger than it was before we began our cutting of
interest rates  so in retrospect i think our monetary policy although not perfect certainlyand our
communication was not always perfectbroadly speaking was appropriate given what has turned
out to be a very severe economic situation
liquidity expansion also received some criticism early on  there was a view that this was
inducing moral hazard  there was also some question of whether this was an effective approach
we were helped in this respect by the fact that the ecb joined us very early in this type of
aggressive policy  i dont know the counterfactual  it has obviously not solved all of the problems
but i think theres a strong perception in the markets and in the general public that these actions
have been supportive and they helped mitigate the effects of the crisis on the functioning of the
financial system  so i feel comfortable also with that approach
the attempts to stabilize failing systemically critical institutions beginning with bear
stearns have obviously been very controversial  there have been criticisms from the right and
from the left  from the right the initial criticism was that we have no business interfering with the
market process  we should let them fail  the market will take care of it  what are we doing  we
heard this as recently as jackson hole  i never took this seriously  i just dont believe that you can
allow systemically critical institutions to fail in the middle of financial crises and expect it to be not
a problem  i dont want to get into the issue about the inconsistency  its true that we treated senior
debt differently between fannie and freddie and wamu and wachovia but i dont think that that is
the reason we are having the financial crisis were having  i think there was a panic brought about
by the underlying concerns about the solvency of our financial institutions  that panic essentially
turned into a run  companies like wachovia that had adequate basel capital faced a run on their
deposits which was selffulfilling  the investment banks essentially faced runs  we did our best to
stabilize them but i think that it was that run that panic and then the impact the panic had on these
major institutions that was the source of the intensification of financial crisis  so i dont buy the
argument that we should stay out of the business of protecting the financial system and i think that
the major factor was in fact the panic that was generated by the underlying uncertainties and the
effect that had on critical institutions
also more recently we have heard more of a critique from the left which is what in the
heck were you guys doing letting lehman fail  this is interesting given that the critique had been
the other one for quite a while  i think that critique is unfair at a narrow level in that first lehman
was a symptom as well as a cause of the recent crisis and second the fed and the treasury simply
had no tools to address both lehman and the other companies that were under stress at that time  i
think that criticism is appropriate though as directed toward the united states as a whole  we did
not haveas the europeans have or as we have fdicia for banksa system that was set up to
allow a reasonable and responsible orderly resolution of nonbank systemically critical institutions  i
think we now have made a lot of progress there  the tarp will provide a good interim solution  it
is very important that in the future we address the toobigtofail problem that we have that we find
ways to reduce that problem and that we find ways to deal systematically with firms that are in
crisis  so given the fog of warwhich has of course been intense going back for more than a
yeari would defend what weve done in terms of the general direction acknowledging that
execution is not always perfect and that communication is not always perfect
now what about the future  history suggests that whenever a financial crisis becomes
sufficiently severe ultimately the only solution is a fiscal solution and we will have a fiscal
solution  there are two possibilities  one is that the financial system will muddle through in which
case the fiscal solution will be of the sort weve already seen  injections of capital support for
critical firms support for the credit markets in general keynesianstyle demand support  thats
one possibility  i hope thats where were going to be  in my own testimony i argued that we
should try to focus whatever stimulus we have in solving the underlying problems rather than
simply handing out money and that we could do that again by addressing credit markets  i would
add foreclosure homeownership and some of those issues as well  so i hope thats where the
fiscal policy will be  i hope that will take the lead from us going forward  obviously well have to
continue to play a supporting role in a lot of different ways
the other possibility of course is that things get much worse and that we are in the same
situation as sweden or japan in which case a massive recapitalization of the banking system will be
necessary  that will eventually happen but i just note that in all of these fiscal dynamics there is a
political economy overlay  you have to get to the point that it is not only the right policy to induce
fiscal support but also that it is politically possible  thats one reason that i think the tarp was not
possible before the most recent period  in fact it was barely possible recently  so again i believe
that fiscal policy will have to be a critical part of the solution going forward
another part that we should not forget about is the international response which is now just
beginning really to become serious  the responses after the g7 weekend on banks and bank
guarantees were important and suggested a commitment by other countries to stabilize the system
thats very important  i think we will see aggressive monetary policy going forward and i think
well see increasingly aggressive fiscal policy in other countries because they recognize that the
decoupling is no longer a realistic story  so thats going to be important as well
with respect to the federal reserve just generally speakingand ill come back to the
specific recommendation for todayagain i think that our liquidity provision has been
constructive  it has allowed the use of our balance sheet to help push in the deleveraging process
thats been going on now for more than a year  my guess is it will probably expand some more but
i dont see it expanding a lot more if for no other reason than we are reaching the limits of our
operational capacity as well as balance sheet capacity  i think we have been reasonably successful
in staying on the side of liquidity provision and not straying into credit or taking credit risk  i want
to stay on that side of the line both for legal reasons and because thats the way monetary policy and
lenderoflastresort policy are supposed to work  again i hope that the fiscal interventions will
now be able to take away some of these responsibilities from us but well have to see how they play
out
i confess that i hear president plossers concerns about reversing these programs  i
recognize that its something well have to do carefully  but i just dont see it as being something
that will be a huge problem if the economy begins to recover and credit markets begin to function
more normally  i think well be able to do it  japan was able to get out the quantitative easing
without too much difficulty  but i acknowledge the point that it is something were going to have to
plan for and think about
on monetary policy i think it is important for us to be responsive  even if we stipulate for
the moment that the interest rate changes we might make today have a minimal effect on the cost of
capitaland i dont necessarily agree with that but let me stipulate itthere is still the importance
of the signaling and what were trying to tell the markets about what we plan to do in the future
frankly i dont think that we should try to signal that we are going to stand pat that we are
reluctant or refuse to move lower  we have to be prepared to move as low as makes sense  by that
i mean in part that there are institutional factors that affect the efficacy of monetary policy at very
low interest rates  were all aware of that  i asked yesterday and ill ask again for the staff to go
back to the 2003 work to update it and to think it through and help us understand what i would call
the effective zero  what is the real zero  is it zero  is it 50 basis points  is it 75 basis points  we
have to recognize that if we do go to literal zero it would have very substantial effects on a number
of financial markets and we would have to ask ourselves whether the benefits from that are worth
the dislocations  the japanese thought they were and for example they did shut down the
interbank market for a long time  maybe doing it is worth that  those are decisions that we need to
make before the next meeting and we will have opportunities to talk about this together and in
public as well  but i do think that monetary policy needs to be proactive and to continue to be part
of the solution here going forward
what about todays action  i essentially accept the general change in outlook as proposed
by the greenbook  since our last meeting there has been an effective tightening in financial
conditions which has overwhelmed the 50 basis point cut that we did with the other central banks
the outlook has become much worse  so it is important for us to act aggressively and to signal
essentially that were willing to do whatever is necessary to support the recovery of this economy
there has been a lot of talk about confidence  i think the best thing we can do for confidence is to
say that were going to do whatever it takes even if it involves extraordinary actions to get this
economy back onto a path where it can begin to grow in a reasonable way again  signaling
coyness being cute is not a safe strategy right now  we just need to be straightforward and say that
were going to do what it takes  in my view just to be specific 50 basis points is the right step
today
now a number of concerns and objections have been raised  let me address just a few of
them  one is president bullards very interesting presentation on the inflation trap and intuitively
its clear that for a given real interest rate you can have an equilibrium at which you have a high
nominal rate and a high expected inflation rate or you can have a low nominal rate and deflation
both of those things are possible  that was the trap that japan got into  we obviously want to
avoid the deflation trap  the question is how do you avoid it  as far as i can seeobviously we
can get further into thisthe best two ways to avoid it are first as president lacker suggested
reaffirm our commitment to price stability defined as 1 to 2 percent or whatever our committees
general view is  were going to try to do that with our projections and potentially with the trial
projection that were doing and i think we can continue to strengthen our commitment to
maintaining a positive inflation rate  the other thing in terms of the dynamics is to be aggressive
in trying to avoid getting to a deflationary situation where those expectations move in that direction
i dont think deflation expectations will arise spontaneously because were cutting interest rates  i
think theyll arise because the economy is expected to be extremely weak and anything we can do
to eliminate that expectation in my view would be helpful
the second objection ive heard is the question of whether or not these actions are effective
i think they are effective  maybe theyre not as effective as under normal circumstances but let me
put it to you this way  if we cut 50 basis points today and the liborois spread rises 50 basis
points tomorrow i will accept that theres a problem  but if the libor spread doesnt move much
and the overall libor drops 50 basis points then i think that were having an effect  if you look at
libor over the past year youll see a dramatic decline even though the spreads have widened  i
dont think you can argue that were not having any effect  to the extent that were having a muted
effect you can just as well argue that we should be more aggressive because you need to do more to
get the same impact  so i understand those concerns and i reiterate responding to governor duke
and others that as we get very low there are side effects on certain institutions and financial
markets  we need to understand those and thats part of our decision process  but i dont think its
the case that monetary policy has zero impact
the third argument ive heard is the keep the power dry argument  unless you think that
movements in the rate are entirely psychological in their effect i dont think that thats a strong
argument in this particular circumstance  again we analyzed this quite a bit in the 2003 episode
and the general outcome from the literature and from simulations done by our own staffdave
reifschneider john williams and others have published research on thisis that the best way to
avoid the zero bound is to be more aggressive than normal to try to avoid the accumulation of
weakness and try to avoid getting into that trap  so morepreemptive strategies are in fact
consistent with what weve done for the last year
my recommendation for today is 50 basis points and the language in alternative a  i do
think that it will be at least moderately beneficial both in terms of psychology and in terms of
reducing the cost of funding and giving some additional support to funding markets  i hope that in
these remarks which again are somewhat extemporaneous i have addressed to some extent the
future steps  we ought again to think very hard in the next six weeks about what the real zero is
and what the implications are of going below say 75 basis points  then we ought to make a
determination and it may be that we can sit still in december  it may be that things improve quite a
bit in the markets for example  its possible  one advantage of doing 50 today is that we almost
certainly will not have to do anything intermeeting because we will have done this significant step
today  so in december well be able to look at the situation  we may be able to do little or
nothingit is possible  but if we decide that further action is needed at that point we should be
prepared to decide what the regime is going to be how far were going to go and what the effective
zero is and i think that we shouldnt hesitate to do that if thats what the situation calls for  so i
think there is a way forward  i understand the need to withdraw all these policy actions at an
appropriate time  but i dont think that focusing on the near term for the moment is at all
inconsistent with the fact that at some point these things will have to be reversed  so any further
questions or comments  president fisher
mr fisher  first i would like to thank you mr chairman for that very thorough and
clear elucidation  i meant to mention earlier that i actually agree with president evans  its
worthwhile now and then evoking ronald reagan  what i mean by that is not his wheres the
pony comment but more important the reason he was so successful as a leader was that he had
clear objectives they were limited and they were well articulated  it doesnt matter if youre a
democrat or a republican  i think its very important for us to understand what our objectives are
in order for us to be fully supportive  by the way tim as mr plosser has been i have been fully
supportive of all of these initiatives  again i want to thank you mr chairman for helping us
understand better the cognitive road map because it is critical for all of us to do what janet
suggested which is have all hands on deck and make sure were all fully supportive  against that
background i would support alternative a  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  other questions  president plosser
mr plosser  just a question or thought  as the staff prepares the review of the 2003
studies and memos and thinks about what zero effectively means and how we might operate in
those circumstances one thing i think would be useful to include is a discussion of whether or not
when that time comes we announce that publicly and say okay  this is it  from now on we have
to do x y or z and make it part of the communication strategy  maybe they would anyway  but
if we get to the point where we now as a group have some concerns that well effectively we really
dont want to go below x we will have to do some other operational actions as a substitute for that
chairman bernanke  i think theres no problem doing that  i can do that  that is
not a problem  president lacker
mr lacker  yes i also strongly support your charge and direction to the staff to
assemble with all due haste updated information for the committee about what the effective lower
bound on nominal interest rates is  but id urge you along the lines of what president plosser
suggested to include in that charge what we would do once we got there what we could do and
what would be open to us  i emphasize again the relevance even if we dont get there because
analytically were effectively doing that right now with interest on reserves  the classic economics
of this is that when you get down to effective equivalence between a monetary asset and a
government bond of oneday duration or whatever to be effective monetary policy needs to be
fiscal policy  it needs to acquire other assets that we wouldnt normally otherwise acquire  were
doing that right now  so id emphasize the importance and relevance of that
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i also think it would be helpful as the staff looks at the
policy options going forward that they do other parts of the communication options toonot just
those but also other ways to think about how to make policy for looking at and communicating a
path that are different from what we did in 2003  it would be good to look at options for how we
talk about policy going forward in that context along with just the operational choices and the policy
choices
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just to follow up on thati think thats a very excellent suggestion
president geithner  to be very specific about that in our trial run one thing that we did was to look
at what we thought was the steady state  one way to engender some communication about the
longer run might be to include what the committee thought the steadystate neutral level of the
funds rate would be in that environment  id describe the path by which we got there it would
convey some sense to the marketplace of what we thought would be in some normal world a
reasonable level of the funds rate consistent with those targets  i just throw that on the table as
something to think about
chairman bernanke  okay  other comments  would you call the roll please
debbie
ms danker  yes  this vote encompasses the language of alternative a that was in the
package passed out earlier today as well as the directive from the bluebook which states the
following
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing
the federal funds rate to an average of around 1 percent

four hours three hours  laughter
chairman bernanke  we should be done by 100
ms danker  its not part of the meeting
vice chairman geithner  the nonmeeting part of the meeting
chairman bernanke  its only a briefing not a meeting once we come back  okay
a twentyminute break now and then well have a briefing and lunch
recess
chairman bernanke  well let me officially get to the point of adjourning the
fomc meeting just by first noting that the next meeting is tuesday december 16  put that on your
calendar
vice chairman geithner  thats a long way away  laughter
