transcript of the federal open market committee meeting on june 2324 2009
june 23 2009afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  this is a joint meeting of the
fomc and the board as has been our custom in the past so i need a motion to close the
meeting
mr kohn  so moved
chairman bernanke  thank you  let me first welcome brian sack officially in
his role as manager of the system open market account  we look forward to a long and
productive association
i also want to mention that i know theres a great deal of interest in the administrations
financial regulatory reform plan and its implications for the federal reserve  tomorrow at lunch
after the meeting i will update you on what i know about it and then we can have some
discussion if youd like
we have a substantial number of presentations today  the staff has made an
extraordinary effort to provide us with a great deal of background information on the balance
sheet reserve management exit strategy and important related issues  if the committee is
willing id like to go straight through the first set of presentations with clarifying questions only
and then have as much qa as the committee would like and then a general discussion  if
thats all right then lets begin with brian sack to report on market developments
mr sack1   financial markets improved further over the period since the last fomc meeting with risky asset prices rising on net financial institutions raising new capital and money markets continuing to heal  those developments reflect and in turn support greater optimism about the economic outlook  however one

1  the materials used by mr sack are appended to this transcript appendix 1
consequence of these events was that intermediate and longterm interest rates came under significant upward pressure
as can be seen in chart 1 treasury coupon yields moved up markedly over the intermeeting period with increases of 20 to 80 basis points  the runup was initially concentrated in longerterm yields but more recently it spilled over into the twoyear yield as well  the rise in the twoyear yield was driven in part by a shift in monetary policy expectations as the green shoots theme continued to gain traction  as shown in chart 2 expectations of monetary policy tightening this year remain limited but the market now anticipates nearly 200 basis points of tightening over 2010
the upward movement in treasury yields was the largest however at horizons beyond the next year or two as can be seen in the shift in the yield curve in chart 3 the upward pressure on longerterm treasury yields came from a variety of sources including an improved economic outlook an associated reduction in the risk of deflation substantial increases in the supply of treasury debt the need to hedge mortgage convexity exposure as rates increased and an ongoing reversal of the flight toquality flows  our survey of primary dealers indicated that many of these factors were seen as important as summarized in chart 4  an increase in upside inflation risk was also cited as a relevant but less important factor
the upward pressure on yields occurred despite the fact that the federal reserve continued to take considerable amounts of duration onto its own books through the largescale asset purchase programs  as shown in chart 5 the soma continued to accumulate longerterm assets through the three programs initiated by the fomc  as the chart indicates those purchases have proceeded at a relatively steady pace towards their mandated sizes  as summarized to the right in chart 6 the desk has purchased 170 billion of treasury securities to date 90 billion of agency securities and 577 billion of mbs  our dealer survey indicated that market participants are not expecting much expansion of the programs beyond the currently stated limits
the median survey response indicated no expected increase in the size of the agency and mbs programs and only a 15 percent chance of expansion of the treasury program at this meeting with the peak amount of treasury purchases put at
363 billion
given their current sizes these programs have had different degrees of importance in their respective markets  for treasury securities the soma purchases have simply been overwhelmed by new issuance  as shown in chart 7 the supply of new treasury debt is far outpacing the accumulation by soma leaving the market to digest considerable amounts of new debt and putting upward pressure on yields  that is not the case for mbs however where the feds purchases to date have been large relative to the size of the market and the flow of new supply
this pattern may explain why the mbs purchases have had such a notable effect on the mbs rate  as shown in chart 8 the mbs current coupon rate fell sharply after the program was announced both because the treasury yield declined and because
the spread to treasuries narrowed  that movement prompted a major refinancing wave with nearly the entire universe of outstanding fixedrate mortgage loans becoming refinanceable  the mbs rate subsequently remained near 4 percent even as the treasury yield began to move up in part because of a perception that soma purchases would be used to hold the line at that level  more recently though the mbs rate began to rise with two important factors amplifying that movement  first the rise in yields reduced repayment risk extending the duration of outstanding mortgages and causing mortgage holders and servicers to try to shed duration elsewherethe convexity hedging mentioned above  second market participants came to understand that the fed would not ramp up the pace of its mbs purchases significantly in reaction to upward pressure on the mbs rate in contrast to the expectations of many  on balance the mbs rate is 80 basis points higher than at the time of the last fomc meeting  much of that change has showed through to the primary mortgage rate which has increased about 60 basis points
overall our view is that the purchase programs have kept treasury yields and mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would have been though they are no longer at the very low levels that were observed ahead of the last fomc meeting
the move towards higher yields has been accompanied by considerable chatter in the market about inflation risks  as shown in chart 9 breakeven inflation rates moved up notably with the backup in nominal yields with the fiveyear fiveyear forward measure the barclays measure approaching 25 percent  however some of the rise in recent months appears to reflect that the risk of low inflation has been  pared and that the liquidity of tips has improved  breakeven inflation rates have not reached levels that would suggest that either inflation expectations or perceived upside inflation risks were unusually high  that interpretation is largely confirmed  by the distribution of longerterm inflation outcomes from our dealer survey chart 10 the chart shows the evolution of the distribution over the last three fomc meetings in general respondents have been shaving down the left tail with most of the mass making its way into the 2 percent to 25 percent bucket rather than into the upper tail still it is important to note that the inflation outlook is now seen as much more balanced as reflected in both the survey and the level of breakeven inflation rates
i will close my discussion of yields by taking a longerterm perspective
although it seems that many factors are putting upward pressure on treasury yields the yield curve is essentially showing the same degree of steepness that has occurred around or just after the end of previous recessions as can be seen in chart 11  thus despite the unprecedented fiscal deficits and the unprecedented expansion of reserves the yield curve is not doing anything unprecedented  of course one potential explanation is that the largescale asset purchase programs have prevented a more severe steepening
the greater prospects for an economic recovery are also reflected in a broad set of risky asset prices  corporate yield spreads chart 12 came down significantly with the investmentgrade and highyield spreads narrowing by 176 and 405 basis points
respectively over the intermeeting period  that narrowing has more than offset the increase in treasury yields leaving corporate borrowing costs lower  with more favorable costs corporate issuers have brought a heavy flow of new bonds to the market in recent months  equity prices also advanced on net over the intermeeting period despite some backtracking over the past week or so  as shown in chart 13 the sp index gained about 5 percent continuing the recovery seen since the trough in march  the recovery in equities has been driven in part by the view that downside growth risks have diminished  one indication of this is that the negative skewness of equity outcomes implied by options the light blue line has fallen notably from the very elevated levels reached last fall  the willingness of investors to move back into risky assets both here and abroad has contributed to a weakening of the dollar chart 14 with the broad dollar index off by about 5 percent
the positive sentiment in markets has been driven in part by better prospects for banks  as shown in chart 15 share prices of the large financial institutions included in the supervisory capital assessment program or scap have moved sharply higher since march far outperforming broader equity indexes  there may be several reasons for this outperformance but the scap process clearly played a role  the test results provided some clarity to investors about the capital needs of those institutions and overall indicated that those needs were less severe than had been earlier feared this information was greeted favorably by market participants  since the release many of those institutions have been able to raise new capital as shown by the solid bars in chart 16 which has helped to fill the capital needs identified by the scap the hollow bars  in total the scap institutions have raised or announced plans to raise
70 billion in new capital  in addition they have issued more than 35 billion in new debt including 25 billion that did not use the fdic guarantee program  lastly 10 large financial institutions were approved to repay tarp funds and returned 68 billion collectively to the treasury last week
the better sentiment about banks and other financial institutions has helped to improve conditions in money markets  in the market for unsecured lending the threemonth liborois spread continued to fall as shown in chart 17 and has now dipped below 50 basis pointsits lowest level since early 2008  however the spreads on libor at longer maturities still remain unusually elevated and the liquidity and functioning of the libor market is still strained  secured funding markets show a similar patternongoing improvement but remaining far from normal with considerable uncertainty about what normal will turn out to be in the new environment
the improvement in term funding markets has allowed the markets to become less dependent on the liquidity facilities provided by the federal reserve  this is a natural development and indeed a positive sign in that some of the facilities were priced to be relatively unattractive once market conditions became less strained  as shown in chart 18 the shrinkage has spanned almost all components of the liquidity facilities with the total amount of shortterm credit provided falling to about half its level at the beginning of the year
another sign of policy traction comes in the consumer credit markets  recent talf subscriptions have been larger and have covered a more diverse set of asset classes  as can be seen in chart 19 the total issuance of talfeligible abs jumped to about 30 billion in the second quarter  in addition and perhaps even more encouraging some abs deals have been coming to the market without talf support bringing the total amount of abs issuance for the quarter to about 40 billion  thus there are signs that the consumer abs market is at least starting to get back on its feet
the liquidity being provided to the abs market and the return of investor confidence in that market have caused spreads on triplearated abs to narrow considerably as shown in chart 20 for auto and credit card paper  these improvements in the secondary market rates should help to make credit available on more favorable terms to businesses and households  however improvement in the cmbs commercialmortgagebacked securities market has been more tenuous
spreads on senior cmbs have narrowed by much less from their peak and have moved higher of late  newly issued cmbs were the focus of the most recent talf subscription and there was no participation  that outcome was expected though as it takes time for issuers to originate the paper that would be eligible  given the strains in the cmbs market we anticipate that cmbs activity in the talf will pick up over time
overall as shown in chart 21 the total balance sheet of the federal reserve has remained around 2 trillion since last december  however that pattern masks the significant rotation that is taking place in the composition of the balance sheet  as noted above the share of the balance sheet associated with shortterm lending operations the orange area is shrinking notably while the systems holdings of longerterm assets the blue area continue to grow  going forward we expect the total portfolio to expand further as the ongoing growth in the assetpurchase programs will outweigh further declines in the liquidity facilities
that concludes my prepared remarks on financial market developments  let me now turn to the separate issue of whether to expand the existing soma securities lending program to include agency debt securities held by the soma  a memo was circulated to the fomc in advance of todays meeting to describe this proposal and its economic rationale
the intention of the proposed change is to make soma holdings of agency debt available to the market in order to foster improved liquidity and secondary market functioning for agency securities  through an auction format dealers could pay a fee to borrow a particular security offering a treasury security in exchange as collateral this allows the dealer to obtain individual agency securities that might be in short supply in the market
the potential for scarcity problems in agency debt arises in part from limited new supply and in part from the feds assetpurchase program  agency debt purchases of
200 billion would represent approximately 35 percent of total outstanding agency benchmark debt  dealers are already expressing some unwillingness to short agency issues due to concerns about their ability to close out such positions  and while fails todeliver in agency securities have not been substantial we believe that they could rise if there were another bout of financial market strain  indeed agency debt does not benefit from the new fails penalty that was recently implemented for treasury securities possibly making them more susceptible to an episode of widespread fails making soma holdings available to the market would address these concerns which should help to support market liquidity
let me make two additional points about the program  first it involves little risk for the federal reserve as it is swapping an agency debt security for a treasury security with a small haircut applied  second it puts the agency program on a par with the treasury debt and mbs programs as those already have comparable strategies in place  in particular treasury securities held in soma are already included in the securities lending program and soma holdings of mbs can be made available to the market on a temporary basis through dollar roll transactions
this proposal is not covered by the current desk authorization and thus requires an amendment to the authorization as indicated in our memo to the committee  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  if there are no clarifying questions let me go
next to seth carpenter to talk about the balance sheet
mr carpenter2   thank you mr chairman  earlier there was material distributed entitled fomc briefing on projections of the balance sheet the monetary base and federal reserve income  for this meeting the staff has again prepared projections of the balance sheet under various alternatives  here we focus on the baseline and expanded purchase scenarios that were presented in the bluebook the baseline scenario involves maintaining the currently announced limits of the fomcs asset purchase programs while the expanded purchase scenario depicts a case in which the purchases of treasury securities are expanded from 300 billion to
750 billion consistent with alternative a from the bluebook  the staff sent the committee a memorandum that projects federal reserve income using the baseline balance sheet projections and various assumptions for interest rates  in this briefing i will summarize the balance sheet and income projections
the charts in exhibit 1 illustrate the underlying assumptions for the baseline and expanded purchase scenarios  the dotted lines present the projections made for the april meeting  several factors account for the differences from the previous meetings projections  first we have made some technical adjustments to our

2  the materials used by mr carpenter are appended to this transcript appendix 2
assumptions for securities holdings the most significant of which is a slower assumed prepayment rate for mbs  as a result mbs holdings end the projection period almost 200 billion higher than in our last projections  second we have also adjusted our assumptions regarding the credit and liquidity facilities given the recent lower thanprojected usage  most notably as shown on the second page loan issuance under the talf has been revised downward significantly because of the experience with the facility to date and revised staff views of likely use in the future
as shown in exhibit 2 under the baseline scenario the balance sheet peaks at about 28 trillion at the end of this year  in subsequent years talf loans are repaid and securities mature or are prepaid in the case of mbs so the balance sheet contracts to just under 15 trillion at the end of 2016  on the liabilities side currency grows steadily and eventually returns to being the largest liability item
reserve balances shrink reflecting the runoff in assets and the growth in currency exhibit 3 presents the projections for the expanded purchase scenario  the results are qualitatively similar but total assets peak at a higher level at the end of this year and remain slightly higher than in the baseline for the projection period
corresponding projections for the monetary base are presented in exhibit 4 continued largescale asset purchases lead to rapid expansion of the base from august through the end of the year with annualized growth rates of around 100 percent  early next year the contraction of the balance sheet resulting from the cessation of lsaps and the runoff of liquidity facilities causes reserve balances to shrink more rapidly than currency expands  as a result for each remaining year in the projection the monetary base contracts
the substantial changes to the size and composition of the federal reserves balance sheet pose risks to the systems net income that were summarized in a staff memorandum to the committee dated june 17 2009  the memo concentrated on two risks  the first risk is that as the policy rate is increased the income that the reserve banks earn on largely fixedrate assets becomes insufficient to offset expenses most importantly the interest expense on reserve balances  the second risk is the possibility that increases in interest rates reduce the market value of the soma portfolio so that in the event that the desk needs to sell some of these securities to drain reserves to raise the federal funds rate the system realizes capital losses  the analysis presented in the memo suggests that using the baseline projection for the balance sheet the first risk is not significant under most plausible scenarios but the second risk is important to consider
exhibit 5 summarizes projections of federal reserve income and remittances to the treasury under three different scenarios for interest rates  the first row shows the baseline with interest rates consistent with those in the greenbook that is the greenbook as it was iterating on tuesday june 16 just before finalization  the black line in the top left panel presents gross income for the federal reserve system which is driven largely by interest income from the soma portfolio and the red region represents total expenses which is driven significantly by interest paid on reserve
balances which leaves the grey region as net income for the system prior to distribution of dividends  to the right subtracting dividends paid on reserve bank capital and other transfersthe red regionleaves excess earnings that are remitted to the treasury as interest on federal reserve notes the grey region  in the second row which uses an interest rate path consistent with current market rates remittances to the treasury remain sizable and in fact exceed the average remittance to the treasury over the past ten years  the bottom row however shows a scenario where interest rates rise sharplyin this case the federal funds rate rises to as high as 8 percent by the end of 2011and interest expense drives net income to zero and as shown in the bottom right panel remittances to the treasury are projected to be zero from 2011 to 2013
the memo also presented approximate unrealized marktomarket losses for the soma portfolio which are summarized in exhibit 6  at the end of the first quarter of this year the soma portfolio was in a modest gain position illustrated by the blue line for the baseline starting slightly below zerothat is with negative losses because the legacy holdings of treasury securities had an average coupon above market rates  under the greenbook projection longerterm interest rates do not rise appreciably above current levels until 2013 and the portfolio shifts to a modest loss position around that time  under the marketbased scenario losses mount more quickly and before long the portfolio has unrealized losses of about 100 billion  as a result if onethird of the portfolio were sold to drain reserves and so onethird of  the total portfolio losses were realized those losses could conceivably wipe out the remittances to the treasury  under the highinterestrate scenario the red line losses are even higher and mount more quickly  in such a case the sale of securities could quickly lead to significant realized capital losses  as jim and spence will discuss however it is not necessarily the case that the desk will need to sell securities as other tools will be available when the committee deems it appropriate to tighten the stance of monetary policy
chairman bernanke  thank you  let me turn now to bill english to talk about
the effects of high reserve balances on bank balance sheets
mr english3   thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the exhibits that are labeled fomc briefing on possible effects of very high reserve balances on bank balance sheets  as shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit federal reserve actions in response to the financial crisis have led to a substantial increase in reserve balances held by depository institutions  and as shown by the dashed lines the rise in reserve balances is projected to continue through the end of this year under either the baseline scenario considered in the bluebookthe blue linewhich reflects already planned purchases of treasury agency and mortgagebacked securities or the alternative scenariothe red linewhich includes additional purchases of 450 billion of treasury securities later this year  i should note that the projections shown here have been updated from those presented in the memorandum

3  the materials used by mr english are appended to this transcript appendix 3
sent to the committee on june 12 2009 and are consistent with the balance sheet projections included in the june bluebook
all else equal the projected rise in reserve balances implies an increase in the assets of depository institutions  to the extent that depository institutions or their creditors and counterparties are concerned about the resulting decline in the ratio of capital to assets depository institutions may choose to reduce their lending or sell securities in order to limit the increase in their assets  such concerns could be driven in part by the regulatory leverage ratio  as shown to the right unlike the riskbased capital ratios the leverage ratio is based on average total assets including reserve balances  thus an increase in a banks reserve holdings all else equal reduces its leverage ratio  under the us banking agencies prompt corrective action rules for insured commercial banks banks must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least
50 percent to be wellcapitalized  while individual banks can reduce their reserve holdings in most cases such efforts simply shift reserves to other institutions leaving the aggregate reserve holdings of the banking sector unchanged
to examine the possible effects of the anticipated increase in reserve balances we projected the leverage ratios of commercial banks at the end of the first quarter of next year  as noted in the middle left panel in doing so we assumed that aggregate reserve balances would expand in line with the baseline or alternative bluebook scenarios and that balances held by each institution would rise in proportion to the projected increase in aggregate balances  we assumed that the levels of other bank assets remain unchanged  in our projections tier 1 capital declines over the next few quartersreflecting writedowns loan losses and other factorswith the decline assumed to be about half as large as that projected in the scap results for the nineteen largest banking organizations in the more adverse scenario
the resulting projections under the baseline scenario for reserve balances are summarized in the middle right panel  even with the significant decline in tier 1 capital and the substantial growth in reserve balances expected by the first quarter of next year shown in the first two rows the aggregate leverage ratio the bottom row is projected to remain well above regulatory norms
nonetheless as shown by the dashed blue line in the bottom left panel under these assumptions the aggregate leverage ratio does fall below the range seen over the past 10 years  however this calculation does not take account of the likelihood that some portion of the capital raised in response to the scap will be downstreamed by bank holding companies to their subsidiary banks  if all such capital were downstreamed the result would be an aggregate leverage ratio at the high end of the recent rangeshown by the dotted blue line  in these projections we assume that repayments of government capital are made with resources at the bank holding company level and so do not affect the capital ratios of subsidiary banks  the red dashed and dotted lines on the graph show the effect on the aggregate leverage ratio of a larger increase in reserve balances consistent with the alternative scenario for the
federal reserves balance sheet  these projections are somewhat lower than the baseline projections but they suggest a generally similar conclusion
as noted in the bottom right we also prepared projections of the leverage ratios of consolidated bank holding companies and obtained broadly similar results even taking account of the recent repayments of government capital  our projections of leverage ratios for individual commercial banks not shown suggest that they could fall to low levels relative to regulatory norms for some banks  most notably the projected leverage ratio for bank of america is only 501 percent in our baseline projection in the absence of a capital infusion from its parent holding company
however as noted earlier individual depository institutions can take steps to reduce unwanted accumulations of reserves
now please turn to the top panel of your next exhibit  to learn more about how banking organizations view current reserve levels and how they might respond to further increases in reserve balances we consulted with senior federal reserve supervisory staff at some of the largest banking institutions and with staff at the open market desk at the federal reserve bank of new york  these consultations indicated that banking organizations have not expressed material concerns to system staff about their own level of reserve balances or the overall level of reserves in the system  indeed some banks have intentionally maintained high levels of reserve balances as a liquidity buffer while others have profited at times by exploiting the spread between the rate paid on excess reserves and the cost of borrowing in the federal funds market  banks generally thought that they could reduce their reserve balances if they chose to by lending in funding markets purchasing securities or reducing interest rates on deposits  it is important to note however that banking organizations have not discussed with system staff the possible effects of the increase in systemwide reserves that will accompany continued largescale asset purchases
as the supply of reserve balances rises some depository institutions may find it more difficult than they had anticipated to reduce the size of their balance sheets
as summarized in the bottom left panel this analysis suggests that depository institutions should not be significantly adversely affected by the anticipated levels of reserve balances  as a result no policy response appears necessary at this time
however considerable uncertainty remains  reserve balances could rise further than currently projected if economic conditions called for additional asset purchases or federal reserve lending  and banks losses could prove larger than we assumed perhaps running closer to the level projected in the scap  finally with financial markets still fragile and pressures on institutions liquidity still a concern banking organizations may want largerthanusual buffers of capital relative to regulatory norms  given these uncertainties the staff will continue to monitor the effect of federal reserve operations on the size of depository institutions balance sheets and their willingness to provide credit
if policymakers became concerned that increases in reserve balances were having adverse effects on banks intermediation activities several policy options shown to the right could be considered
first the federal reserve could drain reserves by several means including outright sales of securities reverse repurchase agreements orif it received authority from the congressby issuing federal reserve bills  those options will be discussed in the presentation by jim clouse and spence hilton
second supervisors could on a temporary basis exclude all or part of reserve balances from the calculation of the leverage ratio for all banking institutions
providing temporary leverage ratio relief in this way could ease banks regulatory capitalrelated balance sheet pressures  however a change in the calculation of the leverage ratio would be difficult to negotiate with the other us federal banking agencies  and if relief were granted for reserve balances even on a temporary basis due at least in part to the riskfree nature of reserve balances regulators might have to consider comparable relief for other riskfree assets to preserve consistency and reduce distortions  in making such changes the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the leverage ratio would be lost
third to avoid the difficulties that could be associated with a blanket change in the calculation of the leverage ratio supervisors could on a temporary basis exclude all or part of reserve balances from the calculation of the leverage ratio on a targeted basis for selected banking institutions with particularly large inflows of reserve balances
finally supervisors could issue guidance indicating that temporary decreases in the leverage ratio resulting from accumulations of reserve balances should not significantly adversely affect supervisory assessments of banks capital adequacy given the low risk posed by reserve holdings and the recognition by supervisors that the increase in reserve balances is the temporary result of monetary policy actions such guidance perhaps in the form of an interagency statement could acknowledge the impact of increased reserve balances on leverage ratios explain the reason for the elevated levels of reserves and note the very low risk associated with reserve balances  thank you  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you bill  let me turn now to trish mosser on large
scale asset purchases
ms mosser  the recent rise in longterm yields has highlighted a number of challenges to the largescale asset purchase programschallenges related both to policy intent and to implementation  in light of the recent changes in market and macroeconomic conditions my briefing discusses a few potential changes large and small to the purchase programs that the committee may consider going forward
in order to help frame your thinking and ours about the purchase programs the staff prepared a note discussing whether the effects of purchases come about primarily through changes to stocks or flows of assets  basic theoretical models point mainly to stocks affecting interest rates  but practical market considerations finance microstructure models and our experience with purchase programs to date suggest that both the stock and the pace of asset purchases can effect yields  the purchase programs all produced significant announcement effects suggesting that the expected decline in the stock of assets lowered yields  for treasuries the stock effect appears to be more important than the flow effect perhaps because the treasury market is highly liquid with good price transparency and predictable supply so informational asymmetries and inventory frictions that are associated with flow effects are smaller also the treasury program is by far the smallest relative to the size of the overall market so flows of purchases are likely to have a smaller ongoing impact on yields
in contrast both the mbs and the agency debt purchase programs are large relative to the size of their respective markets and in both cases the size and pace of new supply is quite uncertain leaving more scope for the feds purchases to have a significant ongoing effect on prices  as a result it is not surprising that the feds purchases caused not only upfront announcement effects but also ongoing reductions in mbs and agency spreads as markets adjusted to the pace of purchases
as brian noted in his presentation in recent weeks when it became clear to market participants that the pace of mbs purchases would not be adjusted as yields edged higher mbs and mortgage rates rose sharply  of course the convexity of mortgages and mbs was the main reason that the backup in mortgage yields was so large and so quick but some of the increase in yields reflected adjustments to market expectations of the program based on the desks flow of purchases
regardless of what changes if any the committee decides to make to the purchase programs our analysis and particularly our recent experience highlight the ongoing need for clear public communication about the policy intent and goals of the purchase programs as well as about their implementation  moreover given that both the stock and flow of fed purchases appear to influence yields and spreads we believe there are number of program changes that the committee may wish to consider  broadly speaking these changes fall into two categories  1 changes specifically related to size and flexibility of the programsin other words related to stock and flow effects of the programs and 2 other implementation changes to enhance the effectiveness of the programs
let me start with the options related to the size and flexibility of the programs  if the committee believes that the recent runup in longterm yields represents an unwelcome tightening of credit conditions inconsistent with the appropriate stance of policy then an expansion of the lsap program may be attractive  given its small size the treasury purchase program is a logical candidate for such an expansion  a large expansionfor example of up to 750 billion through yearendwould be a surprise to the market and in the staffs view it would significantly lower longterm
yields  of course such an expansion could also increase concerns about debt monetization and perhaps inflation
alternatively a more modest expansionextensionto 450 billion through yearendmight be attractive because it would raise fewer concerns about debt monetization  this change could be communicated as a continuation of the current program and an alignment of the end dates of all three purchase programs with an additional note that all may be adjusted in the future depending on the economic
outlook and financial conditions  this may be particularly attractive if you believe it is premature to plan and communicate the end of the treasury purchase program
the treasury program endgame will certainly move to the forefront of market and policy discussions if the treasury program is kept unchanged
expansion of the mbs purchase program is another option that has the advantage of being half a step removed from debt monetization  however given reduced expectations for new mbs issuance and the already large size of the program the staff has some concerns that a larger mbs program would run the risk of soma purchases distorting market functioning  for reasons that we have highlighted in the past we do not recommend expanding the agency debt program given its large size and its impact to date
while the staff does not recommend explicitly reallocating funds across the various purchase programs eg reducing the mbs program and reallocating to treasury purchases the committee might want to consider implementation strategies that increase the flexibility of the programs
regardless of what the committee decides about the size of the purchase programs it could consider a portfolio approach in which the timing size and particularly the composition of purchases are adjusted in response to market conditions done in a manner that makes the most efficient use of the feds balance sheet  for example in a scenario of rising yields and narrowing spreads on mbs and agencies the desk could shift toward purchasing treasuries in a scenario of falling yields and widening spreads the desk could shift purchases away from treasuries and toward mbs and agencies and in a scenario of declining yields and narrowing spreads the desk could simply purchase less of everything  this approach could have the added advantage of containing the future size of the balance sheet to the extent that it targets purchases where they are perceived to have the greatest policy impact  it could also help to reduce volatility and minimize market distortions of the purchase programs
however this approach also entails a significant complication in that such changes to desk operations would presumably require the committee to articulate to the desk and to the market what its reaction function is  formulating this reaction function would be difficult partly because the appropriate levels of spreads and yields would depend on both macroeconomic and financial conditions  setting and communicating about a policy stance that is dependent on macro and financial
conditions is what the committee does in normal times of course  but these are neither normal policy circumstances nor normal operating procedures to pull this off in present circumstances may be quite complex
alternatively the committee could move in the direction of giving the desk more flexibility within asset classes by purchasing larger quantities when spreads and yields are rising and fewer assets when they are falling  this approachif appropriately formulated communicated and executedhas the advantage that it could reduce volatility and consequently perhaps lessen the need for actually making large adjustments to operations  however a flexible pace of purchases is likely to be credible only if the size of the purchase program is relatively large  as a result the staff would not recommend such a strategy for the treasury purchase program at its current size
one final note on this topic  selling put options is one way that the desk could implement such a flexible responsive approach to the purchase programs  a strategy of buying more when the yields rise in effect provides investors with an option to sell to the fed at a particular price  selling the option explicitly would not only allow us to capture the value of that commitment but it also would provide a hedging vehicle to the market which in turn might reduce hedging costs and thus risk premiums
but an options strategy involves the same communication challenges that i have already noted  if the committee is interested in exploring this further the staff would need a few weeks to address several legal and implementation issues
whatever the committees views are on the merits of changing the size or flexibility of the purchase programs a couple of additional implementation issues deserve your attention
first and most importantly the committee could consider how it would like to handle the phaseout of purchase programs the socalled cliff effects  if one believes that the purchase programs affect yields only through the stock of assets then cliff effects on yields are unlikely  however if the flow of purchases affects yields at allthe staff believes we have seen some evidence of thisthen it may be prudent to consider a slow phaseout of purchase programs in the weeks either preceding or just beyond the programs end dates  in particular if no changes are made to the treasury purchase program the staff believes there is a risk of a cliff effect in yields in september so we request the committees views on the advisability of phasing out purchases slowly  in addition the committee might wish to discuss how it would  like to communicate its intention regarding phaseout to the public
second the staff recommends that agency mbs purchases be expanded to include securitizations of hybrid arms  to date the mbs purchase program has been concentrated in purchases of 15 and 30year securities  adding hybrids would likely narrow what are currently very wide spreads in that sector and so ease credit conditions for borrowers who are not benefiting from the current program hybrids would also reduce the duration of our mbs purchases and thus limit the systems
exposure to income and capital risk  however because this program is likely to be quite small that effect would not be large  purchases of hybrids are covered by the current directive and thus would not require further explicit authorization by the committee  although arms are slightly more complicated to purchase than
fixedrate mbs a hybrid purchase program can be implemented in a matter of days our recommendation is to add purchases of arms with fixedrate lockups of at least three years in order to avoid the risk that market participants would incorrectly infer signals about the nearterm path of shortterm rates
a final implementation strategy that the committee may want to consider is to increase the duration of treasury purchases  if the committee would like a bigger bang for the buck on yields shifting treasury purchases to maturities seven years and longer will remove more duration from the private sector and according to portfolio theories likely lower yields  on the other hand such a shift runs the risk of distorting the yield curve and of course it would increase the duration and interest rate risk of the soma portfolio
ill close by summarizing what we see as the key decision points and staff recommendations  first if the committee is interested in expanding asset purchases treasuries appear to be best choice of course this topic is more a subject for tomorrows discussion than for todays  second a portfolio approach to asset purchases has notable advantages including the potential for a larger impact but it requires more articulation of objectives and responsiveness which may be complex to achieve in the current circumstances  third the staff recommends tapering down purchases near the exit  and finally buy hybrid arms
thank you and im happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  at the last meeting i promised we would focus
today a good bit on our exit strategy that is on how were going to unwind the policies that we
have put in place  the last two presentations concentrate on that  let me turn first to jim clouse
and spence hilton to talk about reserve management tools
mr clouse4   thank you mr chairman  well be referring to the package entitled fomc briefing on reserve management tools to target a higher policy rate  the fomc memo on reserve management options described a number of possible tools that the federal reserve might employ to foster effective control of the federal funds rate even with a much expanded balance sheet  the operational details of these various options were described in a series of accompanying memos but it may be useful to note how these various options fit within the usual demand and supply paradigm in the reserve market

4  the materials used by messrs clouse and hilton are appended to this transcript appendix 4
in simple models as shown by the red line in the top panel of exhibit 1 the hypothetical aggregate demand for reserves with interest paid on excess reserves at the socalled ioer rate should asymptote to just a touch above the ioer rate  in practice however the actual demand curve seems to be more like the black line that extends somewhat below the ioer rate  for much of the fourth quarter of last year for example federal funds regularly traded 50 basis points or more below the ioer rate  and in recent months the effective federal funds rate has been about 10 basis points below ioer on average  as best we can tell this phenomenon has stemmed from a confluence of factors  in particular gses and others that earn no interest on overnight balances may have an incentive to lend in the funds market at rates below ioer in addition various impediments to arbitrage in the funds marketline limits banks concerns about capital constraints and possible adverse perceptions associated with significant overnight borrowing in the funds marketseem to have undermined the usual market forces that would ordinarily be expected to keep the federal funds rate close to the ioer rate
consistent with this simple diagram the various options discussed in the memo are classified under two basic headingsthose that aim to strengthen and shape the demand for reserves and those designed to reduce the supply of reserves  as shown in the middle panel the demandside options are aimed at shifting the demand curve to the right or making the curve flatter that is more interestelastic around the ioer rate or some combination of the two
options aimed at shifting the demand curve to the right include increasing reserve requirement ratios and establishing a system of voluntary requirements  simple calculations suggest that increasing required reserve ratios under the current structure to the maximum levels allowed under the federal reserve act14 percent for transaction deposits and 9 percent for nonpersonal time deposits and net eurocurrency liabilitiescould increase required reserve balances quite substantially alternatively as noted in the work presented to the fomc in april of 2008 the federal reserve could develop a system of voluntary reserve requirements  similar to the current program of required clearing balances depository institutions in this system could establish a voluntary requirement ahead of each twoweek maintenance period  the rate of remuneration for balances held to meet such voluntary requirements would need to be above the rate of remuneration on excess reserve balances in order to induce banks to establish a significant level of voluntary requirements
options that might tend to flatten the demand curve include the payment of interest on reserves for all account holders  payment of interest on balances held by institutions such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks would likely increase their desired holdings of fed balances and could induce them to arbitrage in the funds market if the federal funds rate were to dip below the ioer rate  as described in the note by jamie mcandrews the federal reserve may also be able to flatten the demand curve by establishing special accounts that would allow federal funds transactions to be collateralized by balances held at the federal reserve
as shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit the various supplyside tools described in the memoissuance of fed bills the development of term deposits an expanded supplementary financing program expanded use of reverse repurchase agreements and asset sales or scaled back liquidity programsall would work by shifting the supply of reserves to the left
in the case of fed bills this would be accomplished through the issuance of short term debt obligations of the federal reserve that could be purchased by a wide range of investors  fed bills could be purchased by depository institutions but would not count toward meeting reserve requirements  fed bills would be a very powerful tool for reserve management for the federal reserve but would require new legislation
a closely related tool discussed in the note by steve meyer would be a system of term deposits  term deposits would be issued only to depository institutions perhaps via an auction mechanism or by posted rates  these term deposits would not be eligible to satisfy reserve requirements and likely would be structured as nonnegotiable instruments  for example twoweek term deposits could be offered at the start of each twoweek maintenance period  of course the return on such deposits would need to be high enough to induce banks to shift a significant portion of their holdings of overnight reserve balances into a term deposit
as yet another reservedraining mechanism the federal reserve could explore an expanded sfp in which the treasury would issue special bills and place the proceeds with the federal reserve  to be fully satisfactory from the federal reserves perspective the treasury would need to be obliged to meet federal reserve requests for sfp issuance and the bills issued under an expanded sfp should be excluded from the federal debt ceiling
another reservedraining mechanism that could be employed would involve expanded use of triparty reverse repurchase agreements with treasury agency and agencybacked mbs securities  as noted in the background memos reverse rps against treasury and agency collateral will be feasible in the very near future  the ability to arrange for triparty reverse rps against agency mbs may take longer to put in placeperhaps by the end of this year  in the case of agency mbs a very similar reservedraining mechanism would involve temporary sales of our mbs holdings in the dollar roll market
finally the federal reserve could conduct outright sales of assets or take steps to scale back credit provided through various liquidity facilities  these mechanisms would almost certainly be successful in draining reserves but as spence will describe would entail a number of important policy judgments
mr hilton  thank you jim  if excess reserve levels were still high when the committee again wishes to target shortterm interest rates at levels above their effective minimum then the starting point for raising market rates would likely be a
corresponding increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves  this is certain to put upward pressure on bank borrowing rates including the overnight federal funds rate  under improved conditions in financial markets this by itself might well provide sufficient control over shortterm rates regardless of the levels of excess reserves
but if the committee were dissatisfied with its control over market ratesthat is should something like the experience of last fall recurthen the committee would want to be in a position to respond quickly to exert tighter control  for this reason development of some of the tools that have been described is proceeding even in the absence of any certainty that they would be employed when the time comes to tighten policy
among the various measures described above for reducing excess reserves some appear to offer greater potential in terms of their scale or in terms of their availability in the near term than others  several options introduce other issues apart from narrowly operational ones that would need to be addressed before they might be employed on a large scale and we are beginning to look at some of these  and for all the tools aimed at reducing reserve supply we are not certain about the level of excess reserves that would be consistent with tight control over the federal funds rate however we can be confident that large reductions in excess reserves would eventually increase their scarcity value and with it shortterm market rates
i will now quickly review the feasibility of some of the options that jim presented with these additional issues and challenges in mind
issuing fed bills or a revised supplementary financing program exempt from debt ceiling limits are attractive options partly because unlike reverse rps they avoid any need for collateral and its administration which should also make it more appealing to a broader investor base  but either approach would require legislative action that appears to be problematic at this point
selling soma assets on a large scale is operationally feasible even today  but use of soma asset sales as a key tool to drain reserves could be limited by the possible effects on longerterm interest rates that would be hard to predict and on trading conditions that such sales would likely have in those markets  in addition asset sales could have significant effects on federal reserve capital as described by seth
arranging reverse rps against soma assets including agency mbs on a large scale likely would require developing counterparty relationships beyond the traditional primary dealer ones  the dealers themselves are not natural lenders  they could act as conduit between the fed and lenders but their willingness to play this role could be limited because of the effect it would have on the dealers own balance sheets  ideally we would want to reach lenders to banks especially those currently receiving less than the interest rate on excess reserves on their lending  this includes
the gses as possible counterparties either as part of a broader reverse rp program or via separate operations arranged with these institutions
arranging reverse dollar rolls with the agency mbs we accumulate is something we could do now  we are uncertain about how large a presence we could have in this marketthis is something we are exploringand the accounting treatment could require us to realize any capital losses on the agency mbs we delivered even if just on a temporary basis
the counterparties for term deposit arrangements that jim described are of course the banks and other depository institutions directly  at issue is what interest rate incentive would be needed to induce depository institutions in the aggregate to shift excess reserve balances into these term deposits and specifically how far above the interest rate on excess reserves this rate must be  its hard to calibrate depository institutions demand  but experience with interest rate corridor systems suggests that maybe even spreads in the neighborhood of 50 basis points could incent banks to place most of their excess reserves deposits into term deposits  this same observation also holds for the two options jim mentioned for increasing banks demand for reserves  the system of voluntary reserve targets or raising reserve requirements  in either case the question to be solved is the rate of remuneration on reserves held for these purposes relative to the interest rate on excess reserves
to sum up in the future under more normal financial market conditions the ioer framework could be a more viable tool for controlling the overnight federal funds rate or other shortterm interest rates than it appeared to be last autumn
moreover some potential exists for improving arbitrage in funding markets to tighten the relation between the ioer rate and overnight bank borrowing rates  but the system could bring additional tools to bear that collectively could be used to reduce excess reserves on a large scale  but apart from the remaining operational issues to be addressed developing some of these tools to their full potential could involve additional issues such as moving beyond traditional open market counterparties
chairman bernanke  thanks very much  and batting cleanup brian madigan is
going to talk about our credit and liquidity facilities
mr madigan5   thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the material labeled material for briefing on staff proposal regarding liquidity facilities  a number of the credit and liquidity facilities that the board of governors and the federal open market committee have established are scheduled to expire later this year  the pdcf the tslf the amlf the mmiff the cpff and the dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap lines are scheduled to expire on october 30  the talf is scheduled to expire on december 31  however the taf and the authorization for the federal reserve bank of new york to lend to fannie mae and freddie mac have no fixed expiration date

5  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 5
as noted in the memorandum and in various staff briefing documents the usage of most of the liquidity facilities has declined in recent months as market conditions have improved  indeed amounts outstanding under several of the facilities have contracted noticeably further in the days since we completed our memorandum
in considering whether to modify extend suspend or terminate the various programs policymakers will need to balance various considerations
first to the extent possible policymakers will want to avoid contributing to market distortions by providing liquidity at terms that would be attractive in routine circumstances  to an important degree several of the programs were designed with terms that become less attractive to borrowers as market conditions improve  the decline in usage of the foreign swap lines the cpff the pdcf and the tslf reflects this factor
second in order to extend the 133 facilities the board must judge that conditions remain unusual and exigent and the lending reserve bank must determine that adequate credit accommodations are not available from other banking institutions  the law does not define either of these terms leaving considerable room for policymakers judgment
third even though market conditions have improved notably over the past nine months they arguably remain fragile and dependent on government support  with the economy in a severe recession credit losses on commercial real estate and other credits are likely to mount substantially leading to erosion of bank capital and continued uncertainty about the health of individual banks  in these circumstances it seems likely that markets could remain quite jittery for some time  in the absence of backup liquidity facilities concerns about counterparty credit risk could remain substantial and systemic risk could increase from its currently diminished level  as is often the case the period over yearend could also pose heightened risks
in view of these considerations the staff has proposed that the board and the fomc extend a number of the federal reserves liquidity facilities to a point distinctly after yearendfebruary 1 2010  the staff also recommends however that certain other facilities be suspended terminated or modified
as shown in the first row of the table the staff recommends that given the continued strains on the banking system the more liberal terms for primary credit the relatively low spread of the primary credit rate over the target federal funds rate and the availability of primary credit loans with terms of up to 90 daysbe maintained for the time being  however the staff believes that eventually perhaps early next year it will be appropriate to gradually increase that spread and shorten the maximum maturity
as indicated in row 2 the staff recommends that the size of taf auctions be reduced at this time from their current 150 billion to 125 billion  even that amount would be well above recent bid amounts and the staff believes that auction sizes probably can gradually be reduced further later this year  however in view of the continued fragility of the banking system the staff believes that it would not be prudent to announce at this time a fixed or even notional schedule for winding down the taf  with regard to the longerterm status of the taf as noted in the righthand column the staff is currently leaning toward an eventual recommendation that in the steady state the taf be maintained but at a low level to maintain the operational readiness of the program for potential use in future periods of stress  coming back to the immediate proposal an open issue is whether to accompany the reduction in taf size with an increase in the minimum bid rate say to ioer plus 10 basis points
such a spread over the ioer rate would discourage institutions from using taf as an essentially free means of securing a large liquidity buffer  it would also move in the direction of pricing taf at a penalty so that institutions would not rely on the facility when market sources of funds are available  an argument against charging a penalty is that the program is an auction facility and not a standing facility  moreover charging banks a penalty rate conceivably might stigmatize the facility
with regard to the foreign swap lines row 3 the staff recommends extension through february 1  the major foreign central banks have priced their dollar provision at appreciable spreads over ois and usage has accordingly declined substantially as market conditions have improved  maintaining the swap lines into early february would help contribute to financial stability while the penalty pricing should continue to discourage unnecessary reliance on foreign central banks dollar liquidity programs  consultation with our 14 central bank counterparties indicates that all are willing to extend the facilities and some of them are eager to do so  the staff plans to conduct a study beginning later this year on the desirability of maintaining some swap lines on a permanent basis
moving to the dealer facilities the staff proposes that authorization for the pdcf and the tslf rows 4 and 5 be extended to february 1  the pdcf is an important backstop for maintaining dealers liquidity during a period of potentially continued market stress  however to increase the federal reserves credit protection and to discourage unnecessary use of the facility the staff proposes to increase the haircuts being charged on most types of investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade collateral for investmentgrade collateral these revisions will utilize the work recently done for discount window haircuts by the subcommittee on risk management
with regard to the tslf the staff recommends that the program be extended through february 1 but it believes that operation of this program can now be scaled down significantly  in view of the improvements in the functioning of the repo markets for collateral eligible for open market operations and declining usage the staff proposes to suspend both schedule 1 tslf operations and auctions under the tslf options program top  operations under these programs could be resumed if warranted by market conditions after consultation with the board and fomc if
possible  the repo market for nonomoeligible collateral has not improved to the same degree as that for schedule 1 collateral and dealers continue to employ the program albeit at a low and declining level  accordingly the staff believes that schedule 2 auctions should continue but that the amount and frequency of such auctions can be reduced to one auction of 75 billion every four weeks and that the desk could seek to scale back amounts further over time as market conditions allow
lines 6 through 8 cover the facilities related to the commercial paper market and money market funds  the staff believes that the situation with respect to money market mutual funds remains somewhat fragile  the experience last fall demonstrated that money funds which are close cousins of banks are exposed to runs that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system  moreover the treasury believes that it does not have the statutory authority to extend its money fund guarantee program which expires on september 18  in these circumstances the staff thinks that continued federal reserve liquidity support for money funds is warranted and recommends that two of the facilities be extended through early next year
unfortunately various legal and practical constraints have resulted in somewhat awkward designs for these three facilities
to be sure the amlf line 6 has been an effective vehicle for helping to stabilize money market mutual funds  however it also has design features that make the program difficult to operate solely as a backup liquidity facility  in particular under the amlf the federal reserve lends through depository institutions and other intermediaries rather than directly to money funds and money funds are required to sell the abcp to the depository institutions at amortized cost in order to limit the risk of breaking the buck  as a result of these features simply raising the interest rate charged to the depository institution above the currently charged primary credit rate in an effort to make the facility less attractive would not work or at least it would not work well  depository institutions would only be willing to purchase abcp with yields that are above the new interest rate and there is not much eligible abcp held by money funds with yields much above the primary credit rate  on the other hand altering the amortized cost requirement may also be problematic because it would increase the likelihood that funds using the amlf would break the buck thus reducing the effectiveness of the facility  accordingly the staff has proposed a different approach to the amlf  establishing redemption thresholds that would have to be exceeded before a money fund could use the program  these redemption thresholds should ensure that the facility is used to help meet money funds liquidity needs and thus prevent runs rather than purely as a credit backstop that money funds can use to shed paper at risk of downgrade
the cpff line 7 has facilitated continued issuance of commercial paper
moreover it has been priced at rates that increasingly appear to represent penalties for most borrowers as market conditions have improved and amounts outstanding have declined steadily  in order to help ensure that the commercial paper market is not disrupted between now and yearend the staff proposes that the facility be extended through february 1 without change  if market conditions continue to
improve but some borrowers keep relying on the cpff the new york fed might counsel cpff borrowers to seek alternative sources of financing
when it was designed the mmiff line 8 was regarded as a useful liquidity backup for money funds  however the decline in interest rates over the intervening period implies that money funds now hold very little paper that meets the requirements of the facility  therefore the mmiff is no longer likely to be an effective means of supporting money funds in the event of a run  moreover money funds are concerned that usage of the facility would entail some stigma  and finally the facility is costly to maintain  as a result of these considerations the staff recommends that the authorization for the mmiff not be extended
currently the talf line 9 is scheduled to expire at yearend  because the talf does not provide shortterm funding it does not seem necessary to extend the talf over yearend simply to align its expiration with the other facilities  however market participants have noted that it can take many months to assemble some of the deals to be financed by the talf and from that perspective the yearend deadline might soon bind undesirably  after further analysis of this issue the staff might bring to the board a separate proposal for a modest extension of the talf
finally the authorization to lend to fannie mae and freddie mac line 10 remains in effect  with the treasury now authorized to lend to the gses the staff suggested that the board consider rescinding this authority immediately  however the staff subsequently learned that the treasury is concerned about possible adverse effects of a rescission of the authority at this time a legislative proposal for restructuring the gses has not yet been put forward and in these circumstances a rescission could prompt questions about the strength of government support for the gses and hence be destabilizing  the board might consider it prudent to defer action on this recommendation for the time being
drafts of board and fomc resolutions to implement these proposals were provided to you last week
that concludes the staff presentation  we would be happy to respond to your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you very much and thanks again to the staff for the
extraordinary amount of very useful work behind these presentations
we will go over specifically what resolutions will be needed to address the program
recommendations  but before we go into qa i just want to ask trish and brian what youre
asking for today  youre asking for a vote i understand on the securities lending for gses  the
other things that you mentioned trishlike the portfolio approach tapering hybrid armsare
you just looking for input at this point or are you looking for a decision
ms mosser  for the hybrid arms we are looking for input  its currently
authorized but wed like the committees views  for the portfolio approach if it goes across
asset classes its going to require very substantial communication by the committee i believe
so thats really much more in the realm of the policy discussion because it would be effectively
making sizes flexible and fungible  regarding more flexibility within asset classes again under
the current authorization we have that authority but wed be interested in the committees
input
chairman bernanke  okay  good  questions for the staff  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman thank you  id like to start with brian  first in your
presentation you did not mentionor maybe i missed itthat the pace of corporate bond
issuance picked up  the spreads have come downthat was well coveredbut tell us a little bit
about the tone and the pace of the market  second have rates themselves come down along with
the narrowing of spreads
mr sack  the pace of corporate bond issuance has picked up  may was a very heavy
month about 40 billion of issuance  that strength seemed to spill into june  anecdotally were
seeing this bond issuance used for a variety of purposes  in part its being used to pay down
bank loans and pay down cp  we are also seeing lots of holding of liquid assets  this activity
may just be some rotation or substitution on corporate balance sheets but the pace of bond
issuance certainly has picked up in response to the more favorable borrowing rates  as your
question suggested certainly the collapse in spreads has been sufficient to outweigh the increase
in treasury yields  so yes corporate bond costs have declined
mr fisher  trish our stated objective was to lower private credit rates and to increase
credit availability and further in your presentation you mentioned two specifics on that  one
was obviously mortgages and the other was corporate credits  so we might conclude that we
have been successful on the corporate credit front  is that a fair assessment or is it too early to
tell  when you talk about lowering rates in your presentation trish im a little confused  our
objective as i understood it was never to seek to lower rates on treasuries deliberately  it was to
have an effect on the private credit markets  do i understand that correctly
ms mosser  yes thats correct  for corporate bonds clearly both yields and spreads
have come way down not just because of our actions presumably but particularly because of the
recovery in equity markets  i guess we can take credit for some of that  on the mortgage side
however the spreads are or became effectively as low as we reasonably believe that we could
push them with both the agency debt and the agency mbs program  that means that additional
purchases are going to have very large side effects as we have discussed in the past that makes
us very concerned about exit and about market functioning and keeping the market healthy  so
at this stage our ability to lower private credit rates in the mortgage sphere is extremely limited
unless our impact in the treasury market directly is bigger
mr fisher  mr chairman i dont know if you want to stick to that subject with other
questions or may i go ahead and ask the other
chairman bernanke  if you have other questions go ahead
mr fisher  if i could quickly ask jim and spenceon the demand side am i missing
something here  wouldnt the simplest solution be to seek an increase in reserve requirements
whats the drawback  the paper outlines the pros but it wasnt clear to me what the cons are
mr clouse  i will comment  spence may have some other points  the existing
regime for reserve requirements is very hard to rationalize  its based on the monetary policy
implementation of the early 1980s and very much focused on transactions deposits  i think that
using that kind of creaky old structure to generate a huge increase in required reserves would be
a little awkward  and then there are the communications challenges associated with why we
would be raising reserve requirements by a huge amount even though they are being
remuneratedit still might be awkward to explain  spence may have some further comments
mr hilton  i would also point out the inflexibility to change the level and the
inflexibility in terms of the scope that it provides the reserve requirement structure in banks in
managing their reserve accounts  i would agree that yes it would work in the technical sense of
giving us some leverage over shortterm interest rates but i would say that with the authority
that we have to pay interest on reserves we could do a lot better and come up with something
thats more flexible
chairman bernanke  the vice chairman has a twohander
vice chairman dudley  i think another issue is of course that the reserve
requirements wouldnt fall precisely on those who have the excess reserves  so youd be
creating a lot of frictional cost by doing it that way
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  when we had reserve requirements on nonpersonal time deposits it was
kind of a nightmare administrativelythere were too many ways around it and it was very hard
to define what was inside and outside  now we dont have the tax on reserves that we used to
have but i still think it would be very very cumbersome and im not sure what the advantage
would be relative to just paying interest on term deposits
mr fisher  so the answer is no  thank you  and then a question for brian madigan
when we talk about an increase in the primary credit spreadand i realize youre not
recommending that currentlyhave you considered the effect it would have on smaller and
regional banks  at least through our discount window we see some increased activity there and
were just a small part of the system  so i wonder if weve taken that into account in that
recommendation
mr madigan  very much so i would say
mr fisher  im just wondering if weve thought about the politics of this now when
theyre a little bit sensitive about a new consumer protection agency and so on
mr madigan  well not so much the politics but the economics  its not just the
11th district  i think there has been a fairly broadbased increase in terms of usage of primary
credit by small institutions because they find the rate attractive  the question is whether thats a
good thing or a bad thing  i think from the point of view of central banking our general
perspective in redesigning the discount window facility some years ago was to set up the primary
credit program as a lombard facility that institutions wouldnt find attractive in routine
circumstances but would turn to only as a backup  pricing the primary credit rate at a level that
is consistent with that was one of the challenges in designing the primary credit program
initially  it surely seems to be the case that as that spread narrows exactly as you would expect
banks increasingly tend to use that as an ongoing source of funding and that is i think the
consideration that needs to be balanced
mr fisher  at the same time we would be maintaining the taf but increasing the
rate so that there would more of a penalty associated with it  did i understand that correctly
mr madigan  possibly increasing the penalty  i think that is open for discussion at
this point
mr fisher  and who are the most active users of the taf
mr madigan  its used by some large domestic us banks as well as by foreign
branches
mr fisher  that would be one of my concernsthe optics of having a facility which
we  at least have seen used by foreign branches and maintaining it even though you might
make it a little bit more difficult while at the same time phasing out something that helps smaller
and regional banks  i just wonder if there isnt a conflict there
mr madigan  my assumption is that the taf would largely be wound down over
roughly the same period of time  the federal reserve might ultimately choose to maintain a
taf in the steady state but at a very low level  it wouldnt be a significant source of funding for
large banks foreign banks or anybody
mr fisher  if i may just ask one more question mr chairman of brian which is on
the fx swaps  in your judgment to what degree have the comparable ecb facilities and the
imf lending program substituted for or buttressed or deterred the effectiveness of our program
in other words we see less demand currently  is it because of those two facilities  maybe your
colleague to your right might have a view
mr sheets  we have seen a dramatic decline in the outstandings under our swap
facilitiesfrom about 250 billion at the last meeting to about 120 billion now and just one
other historical data point is that the peak was around 580 billion in december  my sense is
that this sharp reduction really is a reflection of healing in global dollar funding markets  i think
the policies that have been put in place with respect to imf lending capacity have been important
in soothing nerves of investors globally but i think thats more for the emerging market
economies than say european markets where the swap lines have been so important  in
addition the ecb has some small swap lines with a number of european countries but again i
dont see them as playing significantly into the demand for dollar funding  the bottom line is
that healing in the dollar funding markets has been the key driver there
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker did you have a twohander
mr lacker  well i was going to say that we tried increasing reserve requirements
when excess reserve holdings were really large once in the late 1930s and it didnt turn out so
well
chairman bernanke  it did sop up the excess reserves though  laughter
president rosengren
mr rosengren  i have a question for brian and trish about your figure 5 on the
largescale asset purchases  its interesting what a straight line that is  over the last six months
obviously the economic forecast has changedinterest rates have moved financial conditions
have changedand yet our program has been invariant to all of those changes  so my first
question is whether you think that youre restricted from being able to do anything other than a
straight line program  i thought you had more flexibility but i want to get your sense of whether
you have the flexibility currently to be able to vary the amount that youre purchasing or not  i
would say that in talking to people in the financial community in boston one of the surprises
was that the purchase program was invariant to the rise in interest rates that weve recently
experienced which certainly sent quite a message  did you debate whether you had the
flexibility to do anything to in effect resist some of that increase both in the treasuries and the
mortgagebacked securities
mr sack  we have interpreted the directive as having some flexibility but it is
relatively limited in that we varied the approach that we take to purchases and the pace of
purchases to respond to problems with market functioning  so we do vary the purchases to
ensure that markets can continue to function and that were not causing too much strain in the
markets  one concrete example of this is that the approach to agency debt purchases has moved
to a somewhat more flexible one that has reduced the pace and that raises the possibility of not
getting all the way to the 200 billion because of what weve seen in the development of the
functioning of that market  so weve taken some limited flexibility in terms of responding to
how markets function
i think the more difficult issue is whether to exercise any flexibility in response to
changes in market interest ratesthat is beyond the reaction to market functioning whether the
desk should respond and try to resist increases in say mbs rates or treasury rates  there i
think our view is that we certainly dont have enough guidance from the committee about the
extent to which that responsiveness should be implemented or the yield levels at which purchases
would ramp up  we have not taken a dynamic marketresponsive approach in that regard and
thats why this is one of the issues that trish raised in her briefing namely whether the
committee would like to consider moving to a more flexible approach  she raised the issue of
doing that across asset classes but she also raised the issue of doing that within an asset class to
be more responsive to interest rates
ms mosser  one followup remark to that  on a daily basis in implementing the
mbs purchase program particularly during the refinancing wave we were sensitive to supply
and spreads and we would buy somewhat more on certain days and a little less on other days
but to be honest that shows up as a very tiny bump in the overall pace of purchases  as long as
spreads were continuing to narrow overall we did not make very large changes from week to
week and month to month in quantities  even though there was some daily movement the
changes we made were small ones
in the treasury program quite honestly given its relatively small size we didnt feel that
we had the flexibility nor that flexibility was necessarily a wise approach since frankly it would
not be credible given chart 7the size of it is just too small to have an appreciable effect on the
level of yields  when we were being flexible in agency mbs it tended to be in response to
spreads more than to the level of yields
chairman bernanke  vice chairman you had a twohander
vice chairman dudley  yes just very quickly  on the agency mbs i think
there is some notion that the rate of purchases will somehow be loosely linked to the amount of
originations and the effect on spreads  so we are a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of doing
the 125 trillion but thats also because originations were very very strong and theyll
probably be weaker in the second half of the year  so the purchases will probably slow down a
little bit
to your point president rosengren it would be really hard to accelerate purchases in
response to a backup in yields because that would then run into the conflict of having only so
much authority over suchandsuch a time period  i mean talk about potentially having severe
cliff effects  im going to buy more as rates go up  what happens if rates go up more  then
im going to buy more and then im also going to be out of ammunition  i think actually putting
that in practice without the fomc sort of dynamically altering the limits of how much the desk
could do would i think be very very difficult
mr rosengren  well we could always reload  so there is an option
vice chairman dudley  right but the desk does not want to make a
presumption that youre necessarily going to reload and its probably inappropriate for the desk
to make that presumption  so i think its a pretty complicated thing to do in practice
mr rosengren  we do have a long tradition of leaning against the wind and this
program seems not to be very interested in leaning against the wind  i thought you had enough
flexibility to do that  personally i would hope that you would have the flexibility to do that and
that we might do a little bit more of it
in terms of your hybrid i think its a very good proposal  you did note its a very small
part of the market and looking at data from mcdash confirms that its an extremely small part
of the market  that is a part of the market where if we wanted to push rates down more
aggressively we could do so with relatively low costs  it seems that 1 trillion in mortgages is
a lot to support market functioning  so i actually have a broader goal than market functioning
which is to get the cost of housing down for people who might want to purchase houses
if were worried about market functioning in the 15 and 30year area it does seem that
the 5 and 7year area is one where theres virtually no activity now earlier this decade you
could get a 7year arm for 4 percent no points no closing costs  we havent hit anything
close to that in this period  given where the economy is i dont quite understand why those
arms havent come down and why theyre not priced more favorably  it may be reputational
effects from the subprime market  there might be a reason to stay away from 3year arms
because the 327 has some connotations  the 5year and 7year arms have the advantage of
being longer term while still meeting some of our balance sheet issues  so you might want to
give some thought to the politics of the choice between 3year and 5 or 7year  but it would
seem with the 5 or 7year we could lean against the wind and actually do morewe could
actually try to push the rate low enough so that if the 30year mortgage were very high because
of what was happening in the treasuries it would actually encourage housing purchases in that
market without changing the magnitude of what youre doing  so i would like you to have a lot
more flexibility to do that and possibly to push those rates down more aggressively than weve
been willing to do with the 15 and 30year rates
chairman bernanke  thanks  lets stay in question mode for a while and then
well have an opportunity for free discussion  president lacker
mr lacker  i have a couple of things i want to ask about  first let me compliment
the staff on providing us with a special abundance of interesting analytical reading over the
weekend  obviously a lot of work and thought went into it  let me first check something and
then ask a question  in the projections of the balance sheet there are two scenarios but your
projections for the use of credit facilities and liquidity facilities are the same in both  am i
correct about that
mr carpenter  yes  the difference between the two is not very big partly because
the liquidity and credit facilities are starting to wind down fairly quickly now over the next year
or so  so we didnt see that much reason to make significantly different assumptions about them
mr lacker  so you made the same assumptions
mr carpenter  thats right
mr lacker  i was thinking about it a different way and i wanted to get your
thoughts on this  the basic scheme here is you write down our asset purchases and then
program by program you have a sense of what you are going to project for usage and then you
add those up and then you subtract currency and you get reserves right  in the old days we did
it the other way right  we used to think that if we drained reserves for example that would
force banks to the window to borrow  so we used to think that you would take our assets
subtract currency and there would be a certain demand for reserves and the residual would be
met by borrowing  so you guys have turned it around
mr carpenter  i would slightly prefer to think of it as that you guys have turned it
around  laughter
mr lacker  this is the economics of the market  i mean were just changing policy
here right  let me explain why im thinking about it  we monitor pretty closely the institution
that leads your league table for holdings and we monitor the liquidity management function
particularly closely  they have 150 billion in balances with us  they also hold a sizable
portfolio70 or 80 billionin general collateral treasuries and agency mbs  they view
those two as really close substitutes as liquid assets  by the way i was a little puzzled that in
one of the papers that talked about banks and lending liquid assets never made an appearance
and was sort of the residual i guess
the institution is undergoing a review now  theyre rethinking  what we hear is that
theyre thinking of reducing their fed balance now and increasing their holdings of agency mbs
and treasuries in order to get a higher yield  that suggests a demand for reserves thats
determined by the relative yields of things  another observation i had is that over the last couple
of months weve ramped up asset purchases liquidity programs have come in below
expectations and reserve holdings seem to have been sort of flat all of which is kind of striking
and also has the flavor of this other direction that i talked about  do you see what im saying
mr carpenter  i do  the logic underlying it such as it was was that the use of the
facilities by depository institutions is by and large determined by economic and financial market
conditions that is while financial markets are under strain depository institutions will continue
to borrow and other institutions will continue to borrow and when things get better theyll
borrow less  weve thought of that aspect of it as being roughly independent and for most
cases that seems to be borne out by the anecdotal information we get from markets
the particular institution youre talking about i agree is quite different from a lot of the
other institutions  that bank has a very large amount of reserve balances that it owns outright in
some sense  in addition its also borrowing a reasonably large amount from the federal
reserve  to me that says that its choosing as i think you characterized it accurately its level
of reserve balances as a specific targetthis is how much it wants to hold and it has some
latitude to go up or down
our reading on the rest of the banking systemthe banking system in the aggregateis
not quite that way  the bulk of the activity in lending facilities involves not depository
institutions but other institutions  their borrowing through the commercial paper funding
facility for example shows up as a quantity of reserve balances but its not a depository
institution that has done that borrowing  if we wanted to get that set of reserve balances out of
the banking system theres not a bank that would intentionally repay that borrowing to reduce
their reserve holdingsits the cp issuer thats doing it  so in that sense weve separated most
of the borrowing as a response to financial market conditions and economic conditions in
constructing the reserve balances
mr lacker  in some of these programs like the cpff counterparties are outside the
banking system but in the taf the primary credit facility and to some extent the foreign
currency swap lines those are all inside now  wouldnt you think that how much a bank wants
to borrow is determined in part by how much reserves they want to hold  now to some extent
its an unfair question  we all recognize that in reality its a simultaneous thinggiven the
yields they see they decide how much reserves to hold and given their funding opportunities
they decide where to get the funds  but it seems plausible to me that they choose reserves we
buy assets and that results in inflow of reserves to them they dont need to borrow them from
anybody theyve got somebody else funding them essentially and so they run off the
borrowings
the reason i ask is that in the analytics you have shown us about that you havent shown
us anything about this link through reserves  when weve had this big discussion for several
months now about the effect of these largescale asset purchases it has all been sort of
microeconomic financial market by financial market  if this picture im drawing is right then i
wonder if theres a channel thats missing from your analysis  for example for bank of
america to hold more reserves that means theyd have to want to hold less treasuries and mbs
which means the yields on those would have to go down  so we could be buying peanuts and
crackerjacks and it would drive yields down  do you see what i am saying
mr madigan  president lacker i think we subscribe to pretty much all of the points
youve made but our ability to quantify the elasticities that youre talking about i think is
essentially nil  this is a good area for research and further thought but this is what we could do
in the limited time we had available
mr lacker  i understand  well the reason i ask about this is that the focus is all
supposed to be about exit strategy  weve come through scap and financial market conditions
seem to be on the mend  admittedly theres a lot of downside risk and a lot of uncertaintyis
the economy going to find its footingbut its also conceivable that something like the
greenbook forecast comes about later this year and we get positive growth  and its conceivable
that banks ability to raise equity improvesthis was left out of your analysis you took equity as
sort of an exogenous parameter  but if banks find that because of an increase in economic
growth there are some borrowers that they are interested in lending to they could ramp up
lending and expand equity  if we continue to buy assets and their need for funding collapses so
that the borrowing through our facilities collapses we could get to the point where theyre
holding all the reserves they want  then theres sort of a discrete change where were pushing
reserves up in a way that cant be absorbed by changes in their borrowing  so the concern i have
is the possibility that our programs could get very stimulative very quickly  thats why im
thinking about what the effect would be if they werent borrowing anything but we kept pumping
reserves out there by buying assets  do you see what i am saying  is that a possibility
vice chairman dudley  dont we have the ability to affect the rate at which
people can borrow through the interest on excess reserves  if that really became a problem we
would be able to affect that
chairman bernanke  if that happened the low shortterm rates would be
transmitted to longerterm rates and you would see a decline in rates across the board which
would of course be stimulative  but presumably the economy doesnt respond immediately
and wed be able to offset that by interest rate policy
mr lacker  would we want to add reserves at 100 billion a month or so and raise
the interest rate on reserves at the same time
chairman bernanke  no  i assume that if we came to an exit point and started
raising rates we would no longer be buying assets
vice chairman dudley  all of the asset purchase programs are up to  they do
depend on the conditions at the time
mr lacker  well i just worry  banking is sort of sitting there with a certain amount
of borrowers  im worried about a flip back to the classic model in which we pump in reserves
and they lend it and its stimulative
vice chairman dudley  the other problem is that theyre still balance sheet
constrained in terms of the amount of capital they have relative to their assets  you can see that
in a wide variety of areas for example the spread of jumbo mortgages relative to conforming
mortgages is still very elevated
mr lacker  but presumably their ability to access equity markets is going to
improve
chairman bernanke  we hope were successful in this regard  president hoenig
has a twohander
mr hoenig  thank you and this is a question for you just to clarify  i understand
where jeff is coming from but when i read these papers and i listen to these presentations i
think we have more than an exit strategy discussion going on here  eric has kind of drifted onto
one discussion about managing rates  another is around managing the portfoliohow we
adjust  then there is the exit strategy which has two dimensions but i think we are only
discussing one  the first dimension is the traditional monetary one of how you get the fed funds
rate up  the second is around largescale asset purchases which were not really talking about
today since we still have this line showing our holdings going up and the only thing is how we
are going to adjust the line going up but that is not an exit strategy  that is about how we are
going to manage going up that line that is the concern i think
so i wonder if it would help to split these up when we are talking  i mean part of this is
about managing the rate which is different than exit strategy and it would help clarify when we
get into the discussion part of the meeting to say which one we are going to focus on first  right
now i think we are focusing on all three intermittently here and back and forth and i think that
will cause maybe more confusion
chairman bernanke  president lacker were you finished
mr lacker  i had two smaller things to ask about  one had to do with mbs spreads
this past intermeeting period is one of those episodes where convexityrelated hedging that is
selling in the treasury market was a widespread feature of commentary and it has happened
many times before in the last decade or so  the picture you get and let me check this is that
there are a lot of holders of mortgagebacked securities who hold a lot of treasuries  so theyre
active in the treasury market and theyre active in the mbs market  is that a good picture a fair
picture
ms mosser  they may have treasury securities that they could sell  they also have
the ability to short them  they can also do similar portfolio adjustments in the swaps market
which through followon effects through other trading mechanisms will affect treasury yields
so they can pay fixed on swaps
mr lacker  so this is broadly speaking a set of financial market participants very
active in mbs markets and very active in treasuries as well  they would seem to have the
ability to look at the spread and make decisions at the margin about buying and selling
treasuries or mbs based on their view of the proper level of the spread or where the spread is
headed right
ms mosser  well the convexity hedging phenomenon particularly in the current
episode was actually more concentrated in servicers and not so much in mbs investors
themselves although im sure there were a few of those that were selling convexity  servicing
portfolios have even more convexity than mortgages so dollar for dollar it doesnt take a big
change in their duration to cause someone who is hedging to sell either a lot of swaps or a lot of
treasuries  one reason for the speed is that there are many servicers they have really really
similar portfolios and they all go in on the same day or two and conduct the same sorts of trades
in the same direction
mr lacker  im less interested in convexityrelated trading per se than the linkages
between the mbs and the treasury markets  there are a lot of players taking a position on the
spread and im wondering what we know that they dont know about where the spread should
be  so analytically on what basis would we make a judgment that the spread is too low or too
high
ms mosser  two things  we used history
mr lacker  this is history they can see right
ms mosser  but we used the long history of spreads to treasuries to make a
judgment about how narrow they were  we also considered whether there was anyone else who
was buying for investment purposes in other words anyone else who was willing to come in and
actually purchase them to hold besides us  if we were the only longterm purchaser we took that
as a signal that we had lowered spreads to the point that they were not attractive to other
investors  that was the place that we were before the convexity hedging episode and its one of
the reasons that we were already beginning to slow down
mr lacker  a related question  one of the memos was pretty eloquent about the
need for greater clarity and better communication about our strategy  is there any chance that
providing the desk with more flexibility about the composition of our asset purchases could
diminish rather than enhance market understanding of our strategy
ms mosser  i believe that flexibility could be a very successful strategy but it would
need substantially more clarity about the committees views and literally its reaction function
for lack of a better term which may be very difficult to do given how far out we are in
uncharted territory
mr lacker  one final question about the interest rate on reserves and the reserve
management tools  does the staff think its at all likely that the effective funds rate would not be
brought up pretty much in tandem if we raised the interest rate on reserves under current
arrangements
mr clouse  i think theres an excellent chance that it would rise  we just dont
know whether it would go up by an 80 percent factor or a 90 percent factorthat remains to be
seen  so i think its very prudent to examine all of these other tools  we just really are in
uncharted territory especially with hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve balances
outstanding
mr lacker  have you thought about whether we care about the federal funds rate per
se that is if the interest rate on reserves is more relevant than the weighted average you
calculate every day
mr hilton  i think its a good question  what does the rate represent  what does
the gap represent  does it represent a rent that banks are extracting or does it represent their
own spread aligned with their borrowing rates and their lending rates  i think thats a legitimate
question and in my mind its an open one
mr madigan  the experience last fall though gives you some reason to think that
the fed funds rate is relevant  the fact that the substantial spread between the interest rate on
excess reserves and the fed funds rate seems to be reflected in other market interest rates like
libor cp and so on suggests that its not solely the ioer rate thats the relevant margin
mr lacker  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i have a couple of questions  on this strategy
for dealing with the largescale asset purchases what are other central banks doing  i notice the
bank of japan is doing just a certain amount per month  and the bank of england just did what
we didthey announced a total  but are they varying within that total  are they exercising
flexibility or is the process pretty mechanical  are there any lessons for us from what theyre
doing
ms mosser  its our understanding that its fairly mechanical  now a couple of
times the bank of england has bought so much that they were afraid that they were reducing
liquidity in the market and they have slowed down again from a market functioning standpoint
mr kohn  sort of like what we have done with the mbs
mr mosser  yes  but they absolutely are much more focused on a reserves or a
money target than the soma purchases have been
mr sheets  the bank of england has moved at a pretty regular pace of about
25 billion a month  one place where i think they do have a little bit of flexibility that they have
chosen not to utilize is in the composition of the purchases they have the gilts approved but they
could also buy corporates and commercial paper yet the vast majority of their purchases have
been in the gilts
mr kohn  other central banks have found it difficult as have we to specify the
reaction function i suspect
brian you mentioned that treasury supply is driving up treasury rates but my
impression is there has been no news on treasury supply  its a very common thing to hear but
i wondered
mr sack  i agree  i think for this intermeeting period most estimates of borrowing
needs of the treasury didnt rise  so i would say thats more of a backdrop condition not the
main driver of the rising yields over this intermeeting period  but its certainly a very important
factor over a broader time period
mr kohn  and finally for seth are there any consequences of not covering our
expenses  can we pay dividends  do we continue to pay salaries  laughter  for the
governors we can do that out of spare changethe vending machine receipts will pay the
governors salariesbut what about for the rest of you
mr sack  if youre going to go down that road you should make the salaries
responsive to the upside as well  laughter
mr carpenter  that sounds like a profitsharing plan for the fed employees  the
accounting treatment is that once theres no net income after paying dividends and that sort of
thing we stop remitting money to the treasury  what happens if we cant even make the
dividend payments to the member banks  the reserve banks would not pay their dividends to
the member banks but they would have to make that up in subsequent years
mr kohn  its cumulative
mr carpenter  its cumulative exactly
mr kohn  are they forced not to pay dividends or is that a choice
mr carpenter  my recollection is that its a choice and part of it comes from
board direction to the reserve banks  then the question becomes how long this goes on it ends
up accumulating through time and then in subsequent years it just takes that much longer before
we start getting back to normal  we have to save up earnings  the accounting for it is still being
evaluated  theres some view that some of the remittances that have already been paid to the
treasury could be recouped by booking an asset thats essentially a prepayment and then that
might be able to be pushed back an extra year the accountants in the system are working on the
actual treatment of that
mr kohn  if we get into this situation theres nothing mechanical about it that would
impinge on our independence  we could continue to meet our responsibilities  president
bullard and i were at a conference where a lot of academics were worried i think that if we
didnt meet our expenses something awful would happen  something awful may happen but
mr bullard  just to follow up on that are there examples of foreign central banks
that have been in a position like this
mr sheets  there have been a number i think that have had to turn to their
treasuries to be recapitalized  i dont have a lot of details about those experiences at my
fingertips but its something that has happened before and there are some precedents we could
look into
mr bullard  my sense of this then is that you are at the mercy of the treasury  if
theyre merciful then they recapitalize you
mr kohn  well no  what i was getting at was that i didnt think you were at the
mercy of the treasury but rather that it was our choice
mr bullard  thats not the foreign experience
chairman bernanke  well the dividends are one buffer  beyond the dividends
presumably and the capital then you would be at the mercy i would imagine
mr madigan  i dont think thats clear  i mean theres nothing that says necessarily
that a central bank cant operate with negative capital
mr sheets  and i would bet that we could also find some examples of foreign central
banks that did have negative capital  you know it can be a little uncomfortable  for the cases
that i can think of they have eventually gone to their treasuries to seek recapitalization but i
think theres a range of experiences out there with this that we can look at
mr plosser  theres nothing that says they cant operate but do you think the
political environment is such that something dramatic might happen in response to that given
what has gone on in this episode  i would think that would be the bigger risk not the accounting
treatment  its the political force
chairman bernanke  this is not going to happen in the intermeeting period
vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  i hope not  the issue from my perspective is that its
political  in other words the day that you find out that youre no longer remitting positive
balances to the treasury theres a nice juicy news story and then they go evaluate  why did
this come about  because the fed engaged in these largescale asset programs and because of
assetliability mismatch  was that prudent for the federal reserve to do
mr carpenter  just to clarify a bit what we sidestepped in the analysis was the fact
that the remittances are actually made currently by individual reserve banks and it is very very
common for an individual reserve bank not to have sufficient capital to equate with surplus and
to make a remittance to the treasury  over the past decade or so its been something like
40 weeks per year that at least one reserve bank hasnt made a remittance to the treasury  so
its not as though this is something that is completely unprecedented for the federal reserve
what would be very different here is that it would happen for the federal reserve system as a
whole
chairman bernanke  president evans do you have a twohander on this
mr evans  well i had a question that was related to governor kohns question on
this  do we have a particular attitude towards marktomarket losses that is capital losses
versus having our net income go to zero  that was one of the more striking graphs a very
extreme example  i would have thought that there would be an accounting entry that would
allow us to continue to fund whatever we needed to do but the political issue seems to be an
important one  it would be well known along the way so that people would see it coming but
some of these tools would involve capital losses right away  would that raise a similar red flag
in terms of our balance sheet  would we be worried about that
chairman bernanke  i think its a consideration  first of all you wouldnt want
to be selling huge amounts  second you probably could mix different assets of different
vintages and do things of that sort  but i think it is a consideration that we should pay attention
to
mr evans  my question was really  do any of the reserve management tools have
better attributes than others
chairman bernanke  most of themlike reverse repurchases things that dont
involve actually selling the assets but rather involve financing them in different waysdont
have the capital loss component
mr evans  we will lose money on them though right  because presumably the
interest rate we have to pay on the repo is going to be higher than the income that its earning
chairman bernanke  well thats the point  if it gets to 8 percent then were in a
loss position
mr evans  yes right right
chairman bernanke  governor kohn were you finished
mr kohn  im finished
chairman bernanke  okay  president stern
mr stern  thank you  ive got a couple of questions  the first one is on the exit
strategy and the second one is a little more tangential  with regard to the expiration dates for
these liquidity facilities if we extend them to february 1 2010 what kind of commitment and
communication are you thinking about so that they actually do end then
chairman bernanke  maybe i could intervene  there would be a press release
thursday which weve been working on and we can show you a draft  here are the proposed
final sentences of the introduction the board and the fomc will continue to monitor closely
the condition of financial markets and the need for and effectiveness of the federal reserves
special liquidity facilities and arrangements  should the recent improvements in market
conditions continue the board and the fomc currently anticipate that a number of these
facilities may not need to be extended beyond february 1  however if financial stresses do not
moderate as expected the board and the fomc are prepared to extend the terms of some or all
of the facilities as needed to promote financial stability and economic growth  the public will
receive timely notice of planned extensions discontinuations or modifications of federal
reserve programs  thats the kind of language that we were trying to communicatenot too
definitive but clearly raising the possibility there wont be any further renewals
mr stern  okay  the second question is about the talf and the quantities  i gather
we now think talf volumes might go to 175 billion whereas heretofore we were up around
500 billion and i think earlier we even had a larger number  is all of that consistent with the
objectives of this program  where is this coming from
mr nelson  i think partly its experience as we work with the program  its an
awareness that as abs markets improve were not going to need as much talf activity to
support them  its becoming consistent with what were seeing in cmbs markets  right now
the numbers were putting down for talf 20 peak at 50 billion which is about what we think
is going to be needed for cmbs and with talf 10 itsi forget the numbers that we actually
put downbut its a more modest 125 billion which is where we see activity at its current pace
ending in the first quarter  so its consistent with the policy objectives  its just accumulated
experience
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  just quickly i want to go back to governor kohns original question on
the accounting  in this document there is a discussion about investments held in consolidated
variableinterest entities with a conservative assumption that we could take a 5 billion hit and
then no more losses after that even if interest rates went up pretty significantly  is that a
conservative assumption  that is if interest rates went up significantly wouldnt you expect
more losses out of that
mr carpenter  it has been the stated policy that its expected that these assets will
be managed through time to recover everything so in that sense the official view is that there
will be no losses  given that the estimate is conservativeits taking on more losses than was
originally expected by the policy itself
the other part thats not obvious to me is the effect if for example interest rates rose  if
that increasing rate was because the economy as a whole was getting better and financial markets
were healing and everyone thought the outlook was very very rosy then the underlying value of
some of those assets may no longer be distressed  some of the writedowns are because of the
strains in financial markets  you could imagine cases where some of those assets increase in
value because the economy is turning around and the outlook is brighter and its exactly those
sorts of multivalent influences that caused us to throw up our hands somewhat and take the
cowards way out
mr hoenig  went to neutral  okay  the second question is also related to the earlier
discussion  in some of the accounting that ive seen and what i believe i saw discussed in here
was the establishment of a prepaid account to the treasury to go back and therefore bring your
surplus up so you could continue to pay your dividends and so forth  are those only allowed
under special circumstances or would those be allowed in any kind of a loss circumstance so
they would enable us to continue to pay dividends
mr carpenter  right now whats envisioned is the case where losses were
sufficiently large that capital would go negative  what has been written into reserve bank
accounting policy is the ability to create a prepaid asset for things that have happened year to
date  they are currently working on ways of going back not just year to date but the prior year
as well so that would be used in the event of losses where you wouldnt have enough retained
earnings to equate surplus with capital paid in
mr hoenig  that would address part of governor kohns concerns about continuing
to pay for operating expenses and continuing to pay dividends
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have a few questions  some of them have
been touched on already but let me just see if i can get some clarifications  one question is for
brian and its related to your conversation with eric about soma lending of agency debt and
the liquidity in the market  you said that one of your reactions so far has been that you have
kind of slowed down the purchases  in fact if youre worried about the liquidity of that market
and were soaking up all of the liquidity whats wrong with another option namely to stop
buying  why create a program where were buying them and lending them back out again
why not just not buy them in the first place and let the liquidity of the market deepen as we
move forward  is there something wrong with that strategy
mr sack  well i think its quite possible that we will exercise the up to part of the
mandate regardless of whether were lending the agency securities or not  i think the desire to
lend the agency securities is in response to concerns about market function which would be
there whether the program ended at 100 billion or 150 billion or 200 billion  in either case
soma holdings are going to be a sizable portion of the benchmark gse market and as i said
were already hearing reports from the market about concerns about shorting and not enough
floating supply of these issues
mr plosser  thats because we are buying them right
mr sack  thats because we are buying them right  its a matter of degree  so i
agree  if you dont get to 200 billion you lessen the problem but i think we would pursue the
authority to lend our agency holdings regardless of whether we thought the program was going
to end before 200 billion or get all the way to 200 billion  were already seeing these strains
we think making these holdings available to the market makes sense in terms of supporting
market functioning treating these assets the way we treat other soma holdings and as i said
posing little risk to the federal reserve
chairman bernanke  this is about making sure that you can deliver a specific
issue  it doesnt affect reserves or the stance of monetary policy i dont think
mr plosser  no i was thinking purely in terms of the liquidity of the market which
i thought you were concerned about  if we are heavily into buying in these markets and taking
those assets out of the market and there are some liquidity problems for some of these issues
then all were doing is turning around and lending them back out again to help liquidity  it
seems like were giving with one hand and taking away with the other  im just trying to
understand a little bit about it
vice chairman dudley  you might not know ex ante which things are going to
have liquidity issues in the future
mr plosser  im not necessarily opposed to the program
vice chairman dudley  having a lending program allows you to accommodate
those shortages that might occur ex post
mr plosser  another question  on the winding down of some of the liquidity
procedures there are some specific recommendations that are made about the taf auctions and
some others about mixtures of extending the dates cutting back auction sizes andor changing
prices in some form  im curious about how the staff thinks about the right mixture of
controlling prices versus quantities the tradeoffs  i mean october is still what five months
away  in thinking about when is the right time if we thought we wanted to extend how much in
advance do we need to do that  is there an option of continuing to sort of just proceed with
gradually ramping up prices or costs of these programs to encourage the users to wean
themselves off of this and go back to the market  then we would not make the decision to
extend maybe fori dont knowa little longer or wait a little while to see whether or not we
can wean these players off and into the market  so thinking about the mix of both price and
quantity controls i guess i was looking for some insight as to how do you pick between those
two and the tradeoff versus extensions or not
mr madigan  i think it is unfortunately a fairly complicated situation so its
difficult to give a simple answer to your question  for one thing we have both standing facilities
and auction facilities and theyre really very different in terms of their philosophy and what you
might think their purpose is and how to unwind them  an auction facility pretty much by
construction can be unwound primarily just by reducing the amounts offered whereas to make a
standing facility less attractive obviously youd increase the interest rates or otherwise make the
terms less attractive  to some degree what weve proposed here has included elements of both
of thosefor instance making the terms less attractive in the case of the amlf by requiring the
redemption threshold and reducing the auction amounts in the case of the taf  theyre just
two very different facilities that require different approaches  as we noted in the memo its not
really feasible to scale back the amlf by raising the interest rate on that particular program
on the timing thats a difficult question  i think one consideration is that as we get
closer to the termination dates of programs market participants will be deciding whether or not
to lend to particular counterparties depending on whether that counterparty is going to have the
option of turning to the federal reserve to repay the investor or the lender  that argues at least
for a significant lead time in notifying the market as to when these facilities are likely to go
away
mr plosser  what i was thinking about was the pace  take the taf for example
the recommendation is to cut from 150 billion to 125 billion and maybe or maybe not to raise
the minimum bid rate  why dont we cut to 100 billion immediately  its undersubscribed by a
substantial amount  why not move the minimum bid to something closer to the interest rate on
excess reserves rather than making it so far below it that were subsidizing at least in the current
environment  were sort of mixing those two things up trying to figure out what the right
balance and strategy are or how aggressive one wants to be in this process
mr madigan  right  it is very much a matter of judgment i think including how
aggressive you think is appropriate at this point given circumstances that arguably remain very
fragile with the banking system still under a lot of strain
mr plosser  well i worry particularly about the tafits so dominated by a
couple of banks and i dont want to confuse supporting a couple of banks with the broader
purpose of sort of what these bank programs might be doing
i wanted to make a couple of other pointsand jeff made both of these in a different
form  one is the communication issue  if you provide more flexibility to the desk to do some of
this stuff communication is going to be really really really difficult and we may be accused of
being less transparent rather than more transparent about that  so i think thats going to be a
very tough task
ms mosser  absolutely
mr plosser  the other point is on the interest on excess reserves  its certainly true
that theres a possibility that as the markets and the economy begin to recover well have a lot of
excess reserves sitting out there  and the opportunity cost to banks may be okay when can i
make a good business loan at 8 percent or 7 percent  and they view the risk tradeoffs for that
as the right ones  we may be faced with a situation even if we thought interest on excess
reserves worked perfectly where we would have to raise the ioer very aggressively to choke
off that massive amount of liquidity that may be just sort of running out into the marketplace  if
interest on excess reserves isnt working as wed like to see it work then we are going to have to
combine that with some other mechanism for draining those excess reserves  the question is
whats the relevant interest rate thats going to guide us in some of those moves  and i think
thats very difficult to sort out even with the tremendous job the staff has donetheres a lot of
forest and a lot of weeds here in trying to sort through the details  but i do think its important
that we try to make sure that if plan a doesnt work we have a plan b  that is we need to make
sure that if ioer doesnt work as we hoped it would we have other mechanisms to drain the
reserves  but we may have to do that at a very rapid pace which may mean some of these
mechanisms that you suggest may operate more quickly and are more easily implemented than
others and that might be a consideration that we have to think about
chairman bernanke  president plosser i think there are two mechanisms that
prevent this thing that youre worried about from happening overnight
mr plosser  i dont think overnight but it may be a period of months
chairman bernanke  the first one is that assuming that we have the power to
raise interest rates which is what this whole discussion is about then rates on longerterm
securities will reflect the expected path of future policy rates and therefore will not go to zero
so to the extent that theres an expectation over the next three years the fed will be raising rates
at a reasonable pace that will limit the amount that the supply price of credit can fall  thats the
first point  and then the second point is of course that although financial markets move
quickly all of our models tell us that the economy itself moves somewhat more slowly  with a
large output gap its going to take some time certainly for the economy to reach its full potential
and i understand all of the issues with the output gap and so on but i dont want to leave the
impression that this is something thats going to require a turnaround within a matter of weeks  i
just dont think thats a real concern  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  first id like to compliment everyone on the
new audio system although it picks up the blackberry noise pretty well too  on the reserve
management tools ive read your speeches and heard you describe them with quite a lot of
energy  were looking at quite a number of tools and yet i wonder how different they are in
terms of their ability to achieve what we want  what i have in mind is that the interest on
reserves tool by itselfespecially with the elements that are designed to help the gses somehow
earn interest on their reservesseems powerful enough so that that should work  but what if
for some reason it doesnt work  maybe somebody could describe the elements of the other
markets that were expecting to take advantage of that somehow would provide an independent
channel that would help out  for example would the reverse repo market really work very well
in an environment where the banks seem not to be arbitraging the interest on reserves
mr hilton  if we are seeing a gap between the rate that banks are earning on excess
reserves and what they are paying i think that i would approach that situation as really an
arbitrage opportunity for us  if were talking about reverse repos as the tool as long as we have
the collateral and we can basically get to those depositors directly or even indirectly then that
would be the mechanism that we would use to grow the reverse repo market  but in
contemplating the potential scale for the operations i dont think we should believe that we are
necessarily limited by measures we currently have of the size of that market  rather its a
matter of how many reserves we want to drain and who it is that is earning a rate from the banks
thats well below the interest on excess reserves and therefore would be interested in lending to
us at a slightly higher rate  so thats how we would simultaneously lift rates and manage down
the size of the banks balance sheets that is bring down excess reserves and some of their
liabilities
mr evans  as i was thinking about this it seemed that one attractive feature is that
the money market mutual funds would be potential customers here
mr hilton  we have thought of them  we havent approached them about it  but in
terms of thinking of a pool of liquidity that might fit the kind of description i provided yes
mr evans  okay  so theres no obvious reason to think that when the banks are not
taking up these arbitrage opportunities theres some underlying feature that also would make the
money market mutual funds somehow reluctant
mr hilton  i dont believe so
mr evans  well theyre not designed to  im just trying to think in terms of the risks
that we might face
mr carpenter  one extra bit of data that might help with that specific question is
that even in the past couple of days and in the past months when the effective federal funds rate
has been right at the top of the zero to 25 basis point bandor we would just say right up against
the rate on excessit has been associated with the repo rate being above the excess rate that is
at 27 28 29 basis points  and weve been hearing that that has been causing some of this
shifting of funds that might have been lent unsecured into the secured funding markets  so i
think that is very much in line with spences point about the repo market being a way for us to
take care of some of that
chairman bernanke  okay  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i just wanted to see if i have this right
about exit strategies  and i have to say brian madigans memo here on liquidity facilities is a
masterpiece of clarity so thank you for that brian
its super clear what were going to do and what were thinking about with each program
why were thinking about it why were thinking of the different options  and when i look at
largescale asset purchases its much less about exiting and maybe its a little bit about coping
but i expected to see more about what we could do if we wanted to reduce our holdings and all i
see is that were going to have to sell  so my question for trish is this  is the bottom line that
the plan is basically buy and hold  in other words when were buying now were basically
committing to a very large balance sheet for a very long period of time and then the other stuff is
all a question mark about what that means in terms of macroeconomics that is whether its
worrisome or dangerous or not  but as far as the balance sheet itself its ramping up and we
dont see good ways to mitigate that
ms mosser  i have two responsesat least two  the first is that certainly buy and
hold has been the staffs maintained hypothesis when we do seths pictures of the size of the
balance sheet  and if were going to be reducing excess reserves in the future while we could
do it through selling probably our first stepand i think this would be the staffs biaswould
be to use the reverse repo market in order to manage to a higher federal funds rate  so thats my
first responseas a baseline probably yes
however there are a couple of caveats to that  it does very much depend on how the
committee wants to react to whatever the macro and financial conditions are at the time we are
exiting  one can imagine a scenario the really highinflation scenario that seth played out
where the committee might very much want to tighten financial conditions in the broad
economy very quickly  selling a really large quantity of assets very quickly would probably
achieve that for you no matter how we manage the shortterm interest rate
so i think its very dependent on the committees views at the time that exit comes
around  its possible to do but the question is  will that be what the committee wants to do
both with the size of the balance sheet and in terms of influencing financial conditions
mr bullard  if you get into a highinflation environment its too late  weve
already failed at that point  i can believe at that point you might want to take more radical
action but the idea is to get this optimal path
ms mosser  we have been purchasing these securities on the upside very quickly
with the intent of influencing private credit rates  on the exit side at the point we would decide
to sell we have been going with the assumption that we would exit much more slowly in the
optimal case  we would sell very slowly and in small quantitiesthis is not built into seths
baseline but we could do thisin the way that we have been purchasing treasury securities for
decades which is to buy regularly in tiny amounts being as marketneutral as humanly possible
that can be achieved but thats a slow unwinding  its faster than whats built into seths
pictures but its quite small  a big year would be 50 billion or 70 billion on the purchase side
on the upside in the old days  so we would assume that size on the downside  so its not a
rapid way to bring down the balance sheet
mr bullard  earlier this spring we were thinking of having fed bills or a treasury
program that would mitigate this problem  but those are now politically off the table  is it
correct to think that now that theyre off the table we have basically committed to a large balance
sheet  thats the way i read these memos
chairman bernanke  they wouldnt affect the size of the balance sheet  theyre
just alternative ways of financing which is what we are talking about
ms mosser  fed bills or doing reverse repos for that matter wouldnt shrink the
balance sheet they would simply shrink reserves that is they would affect the liability side of
our balance sheet but not the asset sidethe assets would still be just as big
mr plosser  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  i have a very brief intervention because its related exactly to this
point  brian a little earlier when i asked you the question about agency debt you said that you
presumed we were going to go to the limit on that  is it the expectation of the desk and the
markets that the operative words of up to certain amounts in our policy statements are
basically irrelevant and that in fact were viewed as committed to going to those amounts and
we wouldnt consider doing less
mr sack  actually what i said before was that the desk may exercise the up to part
of the directive  and what i meant by that is that we may not get to the entire 200 billion on
account of these concerns  now the question is  what does the market expect  we actually
changed our procedures for accepting tenders on agency debt in a way that we think is going to
taper off the pace and perhaps leave us short  i would say this hasnt garnered a ton of market
attention  there may be a period during which they have to learn and adjust to that or it may
just not be that big of a deal  so i think the markets understand we have some flexibility  they
havent reached a definitive conclusion that the soma holdings may fall well short of
200 billion  but presumably over the next several months there will be increasing inference in
that direction if things evolve the way we expect
mr plosser  do you think the same is true for the mbs and treasuries
mr sack  i think the purchases of the treasuries have been regular and steady and
nonresponsive to market conditions and thats very well understood at this point in the markets
for mbs i think what happened is that over this intermeeting period the markets learned that
the desk was less responsive than they anticipated  the current mbs secondary rates reflect that
understanding  its just that the adjustment of how they got there was perhaps lumpier because
of that learning  i think the secondary mbs rates stayed lower for longer because there was this
assumption about more desk responsiveness and they then had to adjust up more abruptly  but
on net its at a point where the markets seem to understand that the desk is exercising only
limited discretion in terms of making those purchases
ms mosser  one comment  on the primary dealer survey that we do before every
meeting we did ask this question about probabilities of increasing versus decreasing  we didnt
really ask the up to part we just asked whether the sizes might be decreased  in all three
categories there was some weight put on decreasing the size of the programs  if im recalling
the numbers correctly it was smallest for the treasury program but thats partly because its
scheduled to end in september and its closer to being done  but there is some weight being put
on decreases in size meaning not getting all the way
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  to continue the grilling of brian and
trish my interpretation in sort of street terms of what you said earlier is that the directive has
been a problem for the desk for last few weeks  and were in somewhat extraordinary times
where you may have been uncomfortableim putting words in your mouththat you were
making policy as opposed to interpreting the wishes of the committee  can you be more explicit
about what youd like to see in a directive that would work and yet at the same time deal with
the external communication sensitivities
ms mosser  okay  ill take a stab at that one  i dont know that it is so much that we
didnt have a sense of what the committee wanted although there were times when perhaps we
didnt have perfect clarity but rather its that i dont think the public and the markets always
understood  for example there was discussion in the market that the treasury purchase program
was going to be immediately expanded in the middle of mayin an intermeeting periodand
extended and enlarged substantially as treasury rates continued to rise  in fact this was a
shockingly widely held opinion despite the chairmans public statements that were close to
being to the contrary  so on the communication issue everyone understands that these are very
unusual programs but it would be good to clarify what your expectations are in terms of the
direction of what the programs are likely or not likely to do  for the treasury purchase program
in particular theres a bit less clarity  for the mbs program and the agency program the
markets have now figured out that up to a point narrowing spreads was the goal  as for going
further than that the desk is likely to step back and say were not going to become the 100
percent only investor  but they learned that by watching what we were doing as opposed to
getting a communication from the committee  if your preference is steady as she goes through
the end of the programs subject to the caveat that if conditions improve the committee may use
the up to option then that would help as sort of a basic starting point  beyond that it depends
on what the committees true views are about the ultimate goals of the programs and whether
they should be enlarged or kept the same size
chairman bernanke  i can build on that  could you imagine language like
will respond to market conditions spreads and the pace of issuance or something like that
would you recommend something like that  would you propose something like that  if so you
need to think about that  is that what you had in mind president lockhart
ms mosser  if the committee is comfortable with the option that i spoke about in my
presentation for flexibility within asset classes and agrees with our assessment that subject to
this sort of communication it would be useful then that would be the right kind of clarifying
statement
mr sack  i would say that if the committee is comfortable with the degree of
flexibility that the desk has been exercising then i would leave it alone in terms of public
communications at least  to the extent that you start to change the directive its going to
involve a lot of guessing about what has changed and whats going to happen now  i think the
market has gone through a learning process that may have caused some abrupt movements here
and there but it has gotten to a point where it pretty much understands that the general approach
is slow and steady with some flexibility around that in response to market functioning  and if
thats what the committee is comfortable with were at a point where we dont need any kind of
public clarification  if the committee wanted the desk to be more responsive to market interest
rates then that would require some kind of communication to the market so that they didnt
have to infer it over time just from our actions
chairman bernanke  i think many of us on the committee would be looking to
you to tell us if you think theres a strategy that for a given amount of purchases would achieve
better results and if so what that is and how you would recommend communicating about it  i
think we have to rely on your market knowledge to do that  so if you do believe thats the case
perhaps for the next meeting or before then you could present us with some alternatives  but if
you think where we are now is fine thats good too  but lets not fail to take advantage of some
improved operating process if it gives us better results
ms mosser  assuming the up to sizes stay where they are i think i agree
completely with brian particularly regarding the treasury program where we simply dont
think anything other than slow and steady is probably the appropriate implementation strategy
given its current size and its current expiration date  we are already frankly moving in the
direction of more flexibility as brian described on the agency debt program and well continue
to move that way assuming that the spreads dont widen and we dont get dislocations in the
opposite direction  if flexibility is going to be useful it would be in the mbs program and
obviously wed be happy to write down a couple of alternatives for the next meeting  it might
help clarify the language
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  another alternative may just be to clarify in the
humphreyhawkins report rather than coming up with a whole new vehicle  it could just
provide a bit more language about what the intent of the programs is and about our thought
processes  from my perspective the statement and the minutes are not great vehicles for
communicating about this
chairman bernanke  but if were departing from what weve been doing we
want the committee to
vice chairman dudley  im assuming that were going to stay on the same path
i still think it would be useful to have something in the humphreyhawkins report that explains
what this is  and then if we depart i agree i think wed have a different directive
chairman bernanke  president lacker did you have a comment
mr lacker  yes  i think you are right mr chairman to ask the desk for their
suggestions as to language that would help them achieve the results we desire  a corollary to
that is that they understand the results we desire  my interpretation of what we decided when we
embarked on this was to achieve whatever improvement in mbs yields would result from the
quantity we sketched out not to peg yields at a given level not to dampen fluctuations in yields
not to reduce the dispersion of future yield outcomes and not to respond in the way the markets
seem to expect us to respond  we didnt put that in the directive obviously and we didnt put
that in the statement either  in preparing for this meeting i looked at the statements and read
them from the perspective of the intermeeting period and it strikes me that there are things in the
statements that markets could have latched onto that led them to misinterpret what results we
desired to achieve  i think thats useful to keep in mind
chairman bernanke  thats fair enough but there may even be technical issues
like not wanting to be the only buyer and things of that sort that we would want to
communicate  other questions  president lockhart
mr lockhart  mr chairman really a question for you not for this side of the table
the treasury proposed that it would have the last call in approving 133 authorizations  have
we developed a view on that and communicated that in any way
chairman bernanke  as i mentioned i would like to defer that to lunch
tomorrow but i will present all of these issues and tell you about the report and the other aspects
that well start undertaking and then cover it at that time  other questions  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  i thought someone might ask this which is
why i didnt get in the queue  brian what kind of reaction do you expect from markets and
economic commentators to the press release the chairman is working on  he read us part of the
draft on the modifications to the various liquidity facilities  specifically do you think theres
much of a chance that it will be read as if not the beginning of tightening the lifting up of the
screwdriver and placing it against the screw  laughter  id also be interested in what brian
sack and trish think about that
mr madigan  first of all it is complicated and i think it will take a while for people
to understand all of the elements assuming the board and the fomc follow the staff
recommendation  a second point though is that it will be read very much in the context of the
announcement tomorrow and what that says about your intentions with respect to the federal
funds rate the asset purchases and so on  in some sense that will really very much condition the
reaction because among other things that will give the economic backdrop the rationale for
how the committee is approaching monetary policy at this stage
mr sack  i would add that without the sentences that the chairman read its a
somewhat mixed release  at least one program is being scaled down but others are being
extended so the direction is not really clear  i think the focal point of the markets would be the
sentences that were read about the extended date being the expected terminal date and i do think
theres some risk that that will be seen as the first stepas you said lifting the screwdriver
so it is a risk
ms mosser  i would agree with that  it is a small risk  because of this renewal the
swap partners are aware of at least that portion of the press release although not of the rest of the
liquidity facilities obviously  we informed them that some language along the lines of what the
chairman read would likely be in the press release  their reaction in a number of cases was
oh well were not going to put anything like that in our press release and a couple of them
were outright concerned about it  so there was a dispersionsome thought it was fine and
others not  i would agree with briani think there is a risk  i dont know that its large but
there is a small risk that it would be viewed as a bit of tightening
mr tarullo  i presume that if you had thought of this you would have already
suggested it but does anything come to mind that would allow us to mitigate that risk
ms mosser  the last sentence that was added to the press release which says the
board and the committee would also consider expanding if things get worse helps to mitigate
that risk quite a bit
mr tarullo  thank you  thank you mr chairman
mr sack  the statement is conditioned on anticipated further improvement that hasnt
really been defined  so i think it leaves open some issues  if conditions just stay where they are
does that mean the programs will be extended  how much improvement is expected  and so
on  i would just say its complicated to signal that so far in advance
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  is the risk all to the downside
chairman bernanke  i think its mixedthere are extensions going on as well as
some trimming back
mr lacker  yes  but is termination also potentially a signal of the confidence we
have in the economy and financial conditions  is there a chance theyd interpret it that way
chairman bernanke  im not sure i want to litigate this here although id be
happy to have discussions with people  its very conditional  if i could once more read just part
of it  should the recent improvements in market conditions continue the board and the fomc
currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond
february 1  however if financial stresses do not moderate as expected the board and the
fomc are prepared to extend and so on  president hoenig
mr hoenig  i have a clarifying question on the discussions around exit strategy and
the lsap  would there be then a discussion at each meeting as to whether we should go to the
up to limit  in other words should there be a specific decision whether to go forward  i think
you have to address that before you start talking more generally about raising the fed funds rate
chairman bernanke  certainly  thats part of the policy strategy
mr hoenig  all right
chairman bernanke  in just a minute we can take a coffee break if that is okay
when we come back we will have a bit more discussion among the group on the issues that
were raised by the presentations  let me just try to identify three topics that we might want to
talk about
the first one is brians recommendations on trimming back the various facilities or
extending facilities  well have to take some board and fomc votes on that  you have brians
handout that shows the recommendations of the staff  so if anyone has thoughts on any of those
that would be the first issue that i would suggest
the second is the set of issues related to exiting from our expanded balance sheet and
raising interest rates  let me just say that many people have called for us to communicate more
about this and i think thats very important  the current plan is for the monetary policy report
which will be issued in a few weeks to have a section which will describe in some more detail
than weve given so far the tools wed be looking at to achieve the exit  we dont want to put in
things that are very speculative  but to the extent that the committee is comfortable with things
like reverse repos and so on wed want to describe those in that section  so any thoughts or
comments about the relative value of different methods or concerns would be useful
and then the third topic would be just the things that trish and brian were raising and
that president hoenig alluded to which is thinking about the asset purchase strategy  even if we
dont change our position at this meeting do we want to begin thinking about a tapering
strategy  do we want to advise the desk to change its reaction function  so we can discuss
things related to that set of issues
of course whatever else you want to bring up is fine but i thought those three areas
might be worth comments in the free discussion period
before we do that why dont we refresh ourselves with about a fifteenminute coffee
break  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  the floor is now open for people whod like to make
comments on the three topics i mentioned before the break or anything else that the presentations
brought to mind  i want everyone to have a chance to speak but i do hope we can get to the
economic presentation today  if we can do this in 45 minutes or so that would be very helpful
would anyone like to start off  governor warsh
mr warsh  mr chairman let me try to be brief but address a couple of the topics
that were raised in the socalled question part of the discussion  and then ill try to go through
the topics that you mentioned briefly
first the remittance discussion where i think we put that in legal termsseth was asked
for decided legal judgmentsand we put it in political terms  i think most of the remittance
discussion actually is about credibility  in the event bad things happen and we end up with
losses that are enduring what does that do to the credibility of fed actions  the feds ability to
affect these markets typically comes not because of the size of the actions but because of who is
taking them  so i think that credibility could suffer in those circumstances and ill try to use
that credibility idea to consider whether we are crowding in other investors to these markets or
crowding out other investors for the balance of my discussion on your third point on asset
purchases
the desk asked for our views on several topics  first on the policy objectives of the
asset purchases i think markets have heard us say different things about what our objective
function is  mine would be to improve market functioning to bring liquidity to markets that are
not trading to narrow bidasked spreads and the like  this would suggest having the desk
devote its resources to securities such as offtherun securities that are less liquid  i think
markets have heard other objectives from us although not explicit objectives such as to set price
levels across treasuries or mbs  i think we have rightly steered away from it  but they think
that we are still cognizant of prices at some level and that we are trying to move rates lower  so
the first question the desk asked is  could we collectively be clear on an objective function  i
think we could and i would suggest that your humphreyhawkins testimony and monetary
policy report might be the best means of doing so
the second question raised by the desk was about expanding asset purchases  im
exceptionally uncomfortable with expanding asset purchases particularly now  the desk i
think had a preference understandably for increasing treasuries  that doesnt fit my preferred
objective which is that were entering markets to improve market functioning  so on that basis
i think that market was working well before we got in it and id say its still working well  but
if we got into it in significant size i could see it actually working less well  had riskfree rates
fallen markedly since we started purchasing treasuries mr chairman i would have expected
some to say  well then we should do more of it  but riskfree rates have increased since we
started purchasing yet i hear some say well we should do more of it  so im not sure what
fact scenario would have suggested doing less of it and it makes me a little uncomfortable  i
think brian sack did a great job of explaining how allin costs of capital for real private
companies in this market have come down and meaningfully so  i dont think that has much if
anything to do with our treasury purchases  it could have much to do with the suite of things
that weve done in the last 20 months but i think it gives too much credit to suggest that
somehow thats related to the purchases of treasuries  i dont think that our science is so good
that we know that increasing the size of our treasury purchases to 450 billion but not to
750 billion would have a modest marginally positive effect  its not at all obvious to me
where riskfree rates would be had we avoided buying treasuries they might have been higher
or they might have been lower  but i must say im not convinced and as a result not at all
comfortable expanding further
in terms of the expanding purchases of agencies i think the desk rightly warns us that
doing so could actually do some harm to that market  given how big we are to the new issuance
market there i think we might well have already done some harm  that is we entered that
market when it wasnt functioning and we helped improve market functioning  but to the extent
that were 70 or 80 percent of certain classes of securities i would say that that twosided market
is not forming well and i would be very hesitant to go further there
the third question raised by the desk  what about flexibility between and among asset
classes that is what if we just pool all of this stuff together and say were smart and were going
to use the following criteria  i think that would be read by markets to mean that were
increasing potentially the purchases of treasuries  i think that would risk crowding out those
investors who would think that there are strange things afoot so i dont think thats a prudent
idea  in terms of flexibility within asset classes i think markets have learned that were not as
responsive to changes in rates as they would like and my own sense would be its a noble goal to
have flexibility but flexibility in a vacuum will lead to continued ambiguity or accentuated
ambiguity  so i dont think that thats a great way forward
in terms of increasing flexibility to be more responsive to market rates i just dont think
we should be fighting against the tape here  im not sure we know what the real marketclearing
rates are for some of these things  in terms of securities lending which i think has been much
abused outside of the federal reserve and poorly understood by market participants i share
brians view that our being in the securities lending business could actually be useful to solve
what i would consider to be the preeminent policy objective of helping market functioning
improve
so thats just a quick list of some of the things that you asked us to address mr
chairman  on brian madigans modifications of various liquidity facilities i think it is
confidenceinducing not riskinducing for the world to know that we are thinking about exits
even those market participants who think that the economy could well unwind again will believe
that we can be more comfortable improvising in a forwardleaning way if we can at the same
time be thinking about how we get out of this when conditions warrant  without going into
detail on brians list i think its constructive and i think that the thursday press release is likely
to be in some ways more impactful to markets understanding of our way forward than our
fomc statement on wednesday  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  on your three questions i agree with much
of what governor warsh just said  in terms of exit strategies i think the staff did a terrific job in
thinking through this and in the very elegant way they laid out the options  in my own personal
view i think we could be a little more aggressive in either cutting quantities or moving minimum
bids up in some combination particularly for the taf and even for some of the others in terms
of the haircuts  in general im very supportive of the strategy  the only thing i was very
disappointed in was the gse facility  that facility came on not quite a year ago  it has never
been used  the treasury got funding to support the gses  i would have liked to have seen that
facility rescinded back in september or october after the treasury got funding  i still think it
ought to be rescinded  i dont think that is a place we ought to be  i do think the announcement
of these modifications to the facilities and particularly the language in the press release that the
chairman read will in fact be positive for the economy as a whole  there may be some places
in the markets that will lose the subsidies that some of these things might be providing but on
net i think it will be a good signal to the marketplace
on the tools for managing the balance sheet again there were a lot of interesting ideas  i
think many of them could work  i would just like to reiterate how strongly i feel about not
wanting to have fed bills  it is a bad idea not because it cant manage the balance sheet but
because i fear that it poses incredible political risks to the system  its an opportunity for
interference an opportunity for the congress and the political parties to view this as another way
to intrude on federal reserve policymaking  although we may ask for the autonomy to make
those decisions that doesnt necessarily guarantee that they will grant it  i have expressed this
view before  i feel very strongly about fed bills as not a good way to go in this environment
many of the other tools though such as reverse repos and others could accomplish much the
same thing and i would encourage us to continue to work on those and the other options
because they entail much less potential political risk
on the lsap issues i agree with almost everything kevin just said  our objectives i
thought were fairly clear that is were not targeting a price or a yield  the markets seemed to
believe that we were  i think we would be well served as was suggested by clarifying it
perhaps in the chairmans testimony in july to try to reinforce that and disabuse the markets
i was struck by some of the other things that the desk was talking about  i want to read a
couple of sentences and i quote  staff sees evidence of both stock and flow impacts from our
experience so far although we cannot be certain of the precise mechanism by which they work
or if the effects are permanent or transitory  that leaves a considerable degree of uncertainty in
designing and implementing the lsap programs  that suggests to me we dont know exactly
what were doing or how its working and so that argues against flexibility and the notion that
were going to go in there and play some game to raise this yield or lower that spread when in
fact we dont know how these mechanisms are working  so i guess i would steer away from the
flexibility  i think that the slow but steady path is just fine and that we can clarify that we are
not targeting a particular yield or price but rather were encouraging market functioning and
liquidity and leave it at that
in terms of the expansion we still have a lot of purchases we could make if we wanted to
im opposed to going out and authorizing more purchases of agency debt mbs or treasuries at
this point  i dont think we need to make that decision right now  and if anything things are
looking somewhat better  so i would oppose that
i would also be against this notion of going in and buying hybrid arms or creating
options  i think we do that because we can  its not clear to me what the objective is  we have
been pretty unclear as to exactly how effective we have been in some of these markets on some
of these prices and yields and what exactly the impacts are going to be  i think the evidence is
pretty mixed on our ability to go in and sort of micromanage various subsectors of these markets
so i dont see any particular reason to expand into hybrid arms or to sell put options on
longerterm assets  i just do not think that is going to help us very much  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman youre going to hear some similarity to what you just
heard from governor warsh and president plosser  i agree with most of the statements that were
made  i feel particularly strongly about the issue of the treasuries  as governor warsh
mentioned im beyond particularly uncomfortable i am especially uncomfortable  i think
theres no evidence that it has a positive impact  we can tell ourselves and we can tell the
marketplace that indeed the corporate debt market has improved  im rather pleased with that
obviously we all are  im not sure theres direct causality but i do think the riskreturn tradeoff
is way too negative  even if we figure out a cute way to say it there still is a suspicion that
were monetizing deficits although weve been much firmer in our public statements on that
and i realize that in chart 4 thats just a somewhat important factor but it is a factor and i worry
about that
i want to come back to brians recommendations  i think we have to be very careful that
were not perceived as basically providing facilities to prop up institutions that are too big to fail
at the expense of other institutions that desire to grow  in my earlier remarks i used the wrong
term  i said political and i meant opticali think the optics are rather poor  if taf is
being used as was pointed out in the staff paper principally or significantly by two institutions
that are too big to fail i think we have to be careful about that  president plosser made a
suggestion that we might limit it even more severely in terms of the amounts i think he was
suggesting a pricing impact there  obviously classical central banking is to lend at a penalty
rate  but that penalty rate is a gift compared to what we would be charging smaller and regional
banks  therefore i would ask you to go through the list and think of which of these facilities are
really in place to prop up institutions that are too big to fail  and i would be curious as to which
of those facilities you consider as actually having an impact there and as helpful on that front and
which are not  but i reiterate my concerns about the optics of taf and the primary credit
recommendations
on the issue of exiting obviously the market is asking for it  everybodys asking for it
i do think the monetary policy report mr chairman is the appropriate vehicle and perhaps
your humphreyhawkins testimony
like president plosser i personally am uncomfortable with fed bills  i dont think it is
politically feasible  the staff points that out  i worry about the market that would be made in
those and the derivatives that would be written from them  i have spoken to that before but i
dont think that is a particularly wise recommendation to make
i will make one last recommendation only half in jest which is that we get rid of the
talf program and we call that the bill nelson relief act  laughter  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  if we got rid of it it would be a relief for bill nelson im
sure  laughter  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  im now a little confused  it sounds to me as though were now having
the monetary policy discussion and if thats what were going to do thats fine  i just want to
know if thats what were actually doing
mr fisher  i was just reacting to the three points that were raised
mr tarullo  i think were now getting to the substance of what i thought was going
to be tomorrows discussion
chairman bernanke  well ill leave it to people to do what they want  i think
the issues that we were discussing were the exit tools the tactics for the desk in dealing with
largescale asset purchases and the winding down of the programs  those were the things that i
asked people to talk about so perhaps we could focus on those  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  ill try to be brief and confine my remarks to
the three things that you asked about  with respect to the credit and liquidity facilities and the
timing of trimming them back i thought that brian and the staff put forward a very well thought
out proposal and its a proposal i completely support  i think it is important to include language
of the type that you read from the draft that youre preparing  ill say this again in the policy
round but i want to emphasize that we have to be very careful not to signal an early end to
policy stimulus and while i see a good reason to withdraw the facilities in the manner that you
set out i think its very important to put in place language that leans against the idea that were
looking for an early end to policy stimulus so i support the proposal and the language you read
on exit strategies i do think you indicated that you might discuss this in detail in the
humphreyhawkins testimony  i think thats absolutely the right place to do it and i think its
important to indicate that we have complete confidence in our ability to withdraw stimulus when
we need to do so that we have the tools to do it and that when the time comes which is not now
or soon that we will proceed to do it
the wording for monetary policy alternative b has been changed but the phrasing in the
original draft of b is the type of thing i think we have to be very careful to avoid  it suggests that
were not sure if we have the ability to exit and therefore we will carefully consider whether we
should expand our balance sheet further  i believe we do have the tools  i thought the staff did a
wonderful job of preparing the memo on exit strategies  it convinced me that if the only thing
we had to work with was interest on reserves it probably would be sufficient  i thought this idea
of strengthening it through collateralized accounts was really clever was implementable and
was almost foolproof  and i would love to see the staff do the further work that would be
necessary to confirm that that is a foolproof technique adding to the arsenal of tools such as
triparty reverse repos and making sure that that is entirely workable  to me it seems that
package if we do nothing else is sufficient for us to assert confidently that we can do what is
needed when the time comes  but that time is not now
on the lsaps they obviously do get into policy issues and let me try to leave some of
the policy issues around this until tomorrow  initially i was an enthusiast for longterm treasury
purchases  i thought the purpose of it was not only to improve liquidity and market functioning
but also to influence yields to push them down  now i didnt see it as a commitment to a
particular rate which would be very dangerous but other things equal and depending on our
assessment of overall financial conditions and the outlook i saw it as an attempt to push rates
lower than they would otherwise be  on theoretical grounds i believe theres a very strong case
that they should have some effect but it has been awfully hard to identify exactly what that
effect is and i think that were beginning to run into costs of pursuing that further  i think our
reputation for independence is suffering and the public is obviously concerned that were
monetizing the debt and that its going to lead to an outbreak of inflation  i have to say that i
completely disagree with these views but i cant say theyre not prevalent  i encounter them day
in and day out  so at the present time i would say the benefits dont merit the costs but i
wouldnt want to see treasuries taken off the table if conditions were to deteriorate and attitudes
were to change
i think our communications around this have really been a problem and as i consider the
concrete proposals the staff put forward in their memo it seems to me that improving our
communications is important  the thing that most concerns me is the autumn expiration date for
our longterm treasury purchase program  thats coming up quickly  we either have to decide
now or well have to decide in august  there will be a lot of market speculation  in the
meantime if we could do something at this meeting to clarify rather than keep the market
guessing i think it would be desirable  this brings me to the suggestionwhich is a policy
decision but to my mind in some sense a relatively small oneto add a sentence that says
something like to align the end dates or the timing of the three asset purchase programs weve
extended the current pace of treasury purchases through the end of the year bringing the total
size of the program to 450 billion  that would say they are all aligned at the end of the year
and that were going to decide what to do with these programs  i would like to see us take that
off the table
quickly on other issues i could see some merit in flexibility in terms of the allocation of
our purchases between mbs and treasuries  we didnt have a concrete proposal but assuming
that were not going to expand the overall level of our treasury purchases except perhaps
extending the program at the current pace to the end of the year then i agree that this isnt the
right time to go in that direction
the idea of leaning against the windi could see some merit in it but it will be
incredibly complicated to reach agreement and communicate to the desk or to the outside world
what were doing and i wouldnt go there now at all  id just maintain steady as you go
i do think the idea of adding hybrid arms to the program is very constructive given
whats happening in the housing market and given that mortgage rates have backed up so much
so if thats a viable practical possibility i would move in that direction too
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  in thinking about the three issues you raised i
start from the presumption that we dont need to convince market participants at this stage that
we will do what it takes to if possible restore stability and to encourage financial and economic
health  i think we need to convince them that we have an exit strategy and that we are prepared
to execute it in a timely way
so against that background with regard to the trimming and extending of the liquidity
facilities im generally fine with the proposal that brian described and the language that you put
forward  if it were my nickel i might tighten up that language and make the commitment to end
the programs a little more forcefully but the humphreyhawkins testimony might be a better
place to elaborate on that whole set of issues
with regard to the lsap those suggestions strike me as solutions in search of a problem
what i mean by that is that financial market conditions have been getting better  now maybe
interest rates have backed up but there are a number of explanations for that and its very
difficult to sort through exactly which might be responsible  if conditions hadnt been
improving i might be interested in trying to finetune the lsap but because they have been
improving i dont see any great valuein fact i dont see any value whatsoeverin going
down that path and i would avoid it
with regard to exiting and raising interest rates when the time comes i guess i think
there are a variety of tools that would enable us to address the situation  theyve been discussed
i am not terribly concerned about this
i dont quite understand the issue about having committed ourselves to a permanently
large balance sheet  the size of the balance sheet is up to the committee ultimately and if we
decide that we want to shrink it then we simply give the directive to the desk that it should be
shrunk and they will have to execute that  so i dont see that as a problem
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i would start with brians description and
im generally supportive of this proposal  it does give an end date and i agree with president
sterni think the firmer that end date is of course the better
on the taf issue that president fisher brought up i think he has valid points but i do
think we need to look at that pretty carefully and i know you are going to do some followup on
that
and because were talking about exit strategies and these liquidity facilities are part of it
it does extend to the lsap  from my perspective the most unusual thing that we have is the
lsap and i think thats where we need to focus when we think about exit strategy  i think at
each meeting we should first make a decision about whether we even want to go to where we
have said the up to figure is  it becomes very important that we make a rational choice around
that because the first step of exiting is not going any further  i think thats critical and takes
time and effort  i also think having the equivalent of gse assets on our balance sheet with these
mbs is questionable in terms of the role of the central bank if we have in fact stabilized the
markets  and i am very uneasy about purchasing longterm treasuries  perhaps it is optics but
i think in some sense its also realityyou are monetizing the debt  so thats how i think about
our exit strategy across all the actions weve taken
in terms of the flexibility on how to administer this i think we should not have
flexibility  if we met the needs of the mbs that we put on and now our additional purchases are
causing other issues then thats a sign perhaps that we shouldnt be going to the limit  i think
we should be aware of this and take note of it and not just say well weve got to get to the
total  lets shift over to longterm treasuries  theres information in the feedback we are
getting from the market that we ought to use and not ignore  thats how i look at your three
questions and less flexibility in the third is better than more
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  ill take the points in the sequence that you
mentioned
on brians and the staffs facility recommendations although i long for the day when we
are comfortable with markets to the point of ending 133 authority im not bothered by the
individual programs  i think theyre well put together and i think the plan as stated is a good
one  frankly i think markets will see the conditional statements in the release as indicating our
willingness to keep the 133 authority for a time  i wouldnt think that they would think were
about to ramp it down but well see  and i do think that ending 133 will be done
appropriately it will be positive it will be a boost much like the scap
on the exit strategies and the reserve management tools much as president yellen
indicated i tend to favor the tools that strengthen the interest on excess reserves mechanism and
there are a number of those that put together should strengthen the arbitrage  reverse rps i
think are also a good tool  if were looking to the money market funds as one source of
liquidity thats going to sort of alter the commercial paper market since theyre a big source of
funding there  and i just dont know what the implications are  wed want to understand
expected dysfunction in that marketas opposed to unexpected dysfunctionto see what wed
be doing there  but reverse rps are quite good i think
on the comment that we should try to project complete confidence in our ability to do
this mostly i agree with that  my first reaction is that youve actually talked quite a lot about
exit strategies already  and in your qa with the congress im not exactly sure how much of
what you intend to say will be new  just your saying it is newsworthy of course  laughter  but
im not quite sure how that will play out  i was very struck by the extreme scenario on net
income which indicated that the balance sheet would be so large that we could find ourselves in a
situation where we are challenged by itchallenged in an optics sense not in our ability to
create new reserves to pay and fund what we need to do  as weve learned through the
introduction of all of our facilities and in using our authorities there is a risk to the institution at
some level that we should be mindful of  i should add that i think it is being handled very well
so far
finally on the largescale asset purchasesand ill try to be true to not talking about
policy on this  the committee selected a number for example for treasury purchases of
300 billion and i thought that it would be implemented to that number  so if tapering effects
are important for a given time frame then i would have envisioned going at x dollars per month
for a time and then within the last one or two months tapering to half of that  that allows the
committee to revisit it in a timely fashion to say should we extend it as president yellen
suggested or it could be tapered on to 300 billion  but it would be a policy decision that the
committee makes  ill leave it at that  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think i agree with everyone else  we
absolutely need a framework that people can have confidence in for how were going to exit the
current balance sheet and raise interest rates  but as well discuss tomorrow i think its way too
early to begin that exit and i do worry about signaling an exit before the economy is really ready
for it  but we do need to have the framework  in that regard im comfortable with the liquidity
facilities proposals in brians memo  i think basically they recognize and validate whats
already happening in the market and thats fine  and i was comfortable with the sentence you
read mr chairman  i think it was sufficiently conditional and i wouldnt strengthen it  my
concern is that if we find ourselves in a position where we dont want to wind down we havent
already told people we are going to wind down but rather we have told people we are going to
be looking at things
i came in a little like president fisher looking for perhaps raising that taf minimum bid
rate thinking that unlike all the other facilities we have thats one that doesnt quite wind down
as automatically as markets improve  my mind is still open on that  i havent heard a lot of
support for that but i thought raising that would reinforce the winding down  i appreciate
brians point that its an auction facilitythey can always cut the amounts rather than raise the
price but raising the price would reinforce that  so i guess on balance i would be slightly in
favor of raising the taf penalty rates
on exit tools i was actually encouraged by the presentations by the staffspence trish
and otherswhich indicated that we do have a lot of tools  and like president evans i see
these tools for sterilizing or reducing reserves working together with interest on reserves and i
feel more confident than before i read the memo that we can accomplish a lot  i guess youre
going to have to work on these reverse rpswho the counterparties are including the gses
and whether you need to diversify past the dealers  im not totally convinced you do need to the
dealers are there to be intermediaries and they can play that role  anyhow that would be a good
thing  and the time deposits i thought also were a good thing
i wouldnt rule out selling assets quite as much as some of you would  we took these
special actions to lower ratesi will come to that nextbut if were in a situation where we are
worried about inflation we can undo them although maybe not in huge size  i would think
selling some of the portfolios depending on the circumstances might not be a bad idea
that brings me to the lsaps  my objectives were different from yours governor
warsh  i voted for this in order to lower interest rates or at least to make interest rates lower
than they otherwise would be  it was keyed to the macroeconomic outlook last march which
was pretty dire and getting worse all the time and we had run out of fed funds ammunition in
december  so i was not uncomfortable  i was in favor of diversifying our portfolio of purchases
into treasuries  i think the monetizing problem is keyed to the fiscal deficit outlook  if that
werent so uncertain and looking so unsustainable i dont think people would be worried about
us  but it is uncertain and looking unsustainable so i think we need to be careful about the
interaction of monetary and fiscal policy  therefore i would not be in favor of increasing those
purchases at this time
i came into the meeting thinking about some flexibility across instruments within the
total amount and across time  but ive been discouraged by the discussion at the meeting  i
think we can set a price or we can set a quantity but setting the relationships of price and
quantity in a clear way is just very very hard  so i think id stick with what we are doing now
i would be okay with small purchases of hybrid arms  i think it might encourage that
market a little bit and help the mortgage market which has been adversely affected by the uptick
in treasury rates  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thanks  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  i think we have to be really
careful about our communications in terms of discriminating between our ability to exit
smoothly and implying that were about to exit  i will probably come back to this point
tomorrow  the anxiety that i have about inadvertently implying to the market that we are exiting
soon is particularly high now because the market has already priced in a lot more tightening than
most of us think is likely over the next year or two  that said of course we have to be prepared
for exit and i think being prepared for exit and articulating that is really really important in
keeping inflation expectations well anchored and also in keeping the dispersion of inflation
expectations compact  so i think we definitely have to do that but i think its tricky to do one
without implying the other
in terms of brians recommendations on the facilities im pretty comfortable with all of
it  i do want to make sure the language stays where it is though and doesnt get more definitive
about what happens in february  i think february is a long time away and i wouldnt want to
prejudge what were going to want to do or not want to do in february  i think where we are
right now in terms of the language is about right  it basically says theres a possibility that we
might not extend it so the market is put on notice  but it doesnt necessarily commit us to
ending the facilities
on the taf i am on the other side of that issue from don on the rate rise  its not a big
deal for me but let me just explain why i am on the other side  i think raising the rate on taf
will be seized upon by some as the beginning of raising interest rates  so its not the taf rate
rise that bothers me per se  i can certainly understand the argument for doing that in the small
but im a little worried that if we do it people will say oh look this is the very beginning of
the rate hikes because they have now raised the rate on the taf  theres also a second more
subtle issue on the taf if we are actually going to go to the sporadic taf auctions over the
longer term  we probably cant really do that in a normal environment with a penalty rate  if
you think of the transition on the taf wed have to move to a penalty rate and then later on as
we go to the sporadic auctions wed actually have to lower the rate again  that just seems a
little confusing to me  but my main concern is the signal in terms of monetary policy that people
might draw from raising the rate
on the lsap i dont feel very defensive about what weve been doing  after all we did
get a really good mortgage refinancing wavethat was the point of the exercise  its hard to
know how much of it was mbs versus treasuries and well never really know for certain  but i
feel pretty good about basically having achieved that objective
in terms of treasuries i dont think theres any appetite for going much larger  i think
the choice is really between standing pat and going to as president yellen said 450 billion and
extending it through yearend  the advantage of the latter is that you dont have to make up
your mind quite so soon but the disadvantage is that it seems like a pretty weak response  it
shows a lack of sort of confidence in what the fed is doing with this facility  so i guess im
slightly leaning toward standing pat because i worry that the other option would be viewed as
too little to be significant  i think the suggestion about hybrid arms makes a lot of sense  in
some ways if we dont do that were basically distorting the relationship between the fixedrate
agency mbs and the hybrid arms and its not really clear why we would want to do that
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you  on the question of extensions and modifications on liquidity
facilities im generally in favor of the proposal but i wonder if one option might be to raise the
minimum rate for taf at the same time we increase the spread on the primary credit so that
wed be treating the two different types of borrowers the same way
on the exit strategies it strikes me that the whole discussion is incredibly similar to a
normal exercise in assetliability management that goes on in banks all the time and that we
should probably be paying attention to the same kind of tools that are used in banks to simulate
various possibilities  regarding these tools i dont think theyre mutually exclusive so some
modeling of an optimum mixa funding mix if you willof all of the various tools taking into
account some of the different barriers that we might run into in different markets might make
some sense
also id be interested in some sort of regular reporting whether it is in notes or the
bluebook or one of the other books so that we keep an eye on the potential costs of the exit
strategies in a number of different environments  as a banker i have been in a situation where i
have looked into the future and have seen losses that would arise from unwinding positions that i
had taken  of course at that time i was never able to adjust my cost of funds absolutely
laughter  so it occurs to me this could involve an incredibly magnified political risk  theres a
huge temptation not to take those losses when the risk associated with taking the losses is very
high  so we need to make sure that were paying attention to those costs particularly if they
would bring us under political pressure at the same time that were doing something thats
politically unpopular to begin with  so again i think modeling those out is important
i guess the statement that struck me the most is that the banking organizations have not
discussed with system staff the possible effects of increased systemwide reserves  i havent
seen any indication that anybody anywhere in the banking industry has thought about the
implications of these very high reserves in the system  ive been trying to think what that effect
might be and frankly i dont know  but it strikes me that this level of reserves is going to have
some sort of effect so we should start to think about that too  hopefully some of our
researchers can come up with some possible impacts
finally on flexibility im probably again headed dangerously close to the policy round
discussion  when we first started these programs i wasnt entirely sure how much we would
need so it strikes me that if a given purchase amount is beginning to impair functioning in any
market that we are in we have to wonder if that purchase amount minus one is also doing
anything positive in that market  that would seem to indicate that certainly were getting close
to an exit for agency debt  and i wonder as originations go down whether we end up in the
same place with the mbs  those are my comments mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i agree with brians recommendations  in terms of the taf option
of raising the minimum bid rate i come out where governor kohn does  there are several large
institutions that are borrowing heavily from the taf that are just holding them as excess
reserves  i think having a 10 basis point charge and making it a little bit costly actually does
make sense it will probably bring down the taf borrowing somewhat which given the size of
our balance sheet probably also makes sense
in terms of the tools for exit i agree with virtually everything that president yellen said
so im not going to repeat it
in terms of the asset purchase strategy we dont need to buy 1 trillion just for market
function and liquidity in mortgagebacked securities  we werent trying to set interest rates but
we were certainly trying to influence interest rates  theres no reason to do something of that
magnitude unless were going to influence interest rates  so i do think that theres still a little bit
of difference around the table about exactly what we think these programs are intended to do
but we made a distinction between quantitative easing and the asset side of the balance sheet
to me that meant that were trying to get the financing costs lower  its hard to break this out
from the discussion for tomorrow  but if were not happy with where we are on our dual
mandate this is the only tool we have  and the way it operates has to be through the cost of
financing  so its a topic for discussion for tomorrow but i think we have to make that link
we cant talk about it separately
chairman bernanke  thanks  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i just have a few quick comments  i agree
with all the points in the madigan memo  i think it does recognize what is happening with our
liquidity facilities  i have advocated before that we get them all priced as backstops and not that
they actually need to be used at every point in time  i would also announce a rescission date for
gse lending  couldnt we make that february 1 2010 as well  that would push it off into the
future and would line it up with the other dates as opposed to doing it immediately  i would go
ahead and raise the minimum bid rate  i dont feel strongly on that  i guess i come out where
governor kohn and president fisher have  my thinking on that was that we could encourage
morenormal market functioning there  vice chairman dudley brings up a good point namely
that it sounds like raising an interest rate  i think thats a communication issue and that would
have to be handled appropriately
on the issues related to exiting my overall reading is that there are some very promising
but unproven ideas here mostly to do with interest on reserves and reverse repos  we think
theyll work but at this point theyre not really proven  i guess im reluctant to go further with
asset purchases without more concrete ideas on how well manage this going forward although i
do admit that these are promising
the current policy response to the crisis has been to lower nominal interest rates to zero
and more than double the monetary base  i think this discussion indicates that that increase in
the monetary base will be very persistent which is unprecedented in postwar us history  i am
worried that we dont really know what the implications of that might be and we dont really
have tools in place to manage that  so were not really exiting from that increase in the base
were just saying  that was our response  were going to more than double the monetary base
and were going to see what happens
on asset purchases strategy id be fine with the tapering off  i dont feel really strongly
on that  i think if we stick with our dates the exit might go fine on the treasuries
in the current environment of large fiscal deficits as several people have mentioned
including governor kohn theres always going to be talk about monetizing the debt  i just dont
think we can get away from it in this environment  anything we do that smacks of buying up
more treasuries is going to be problematic  so even though i have advocated in the past for
treating mbs and treasuries and debt all as one package and letting the desk manage it now i
think it may not be the best thing to do
im also sympathetic with president rosengren who spoke earlier this afternoon about a
statecontingent reaction function  i have advocated for this before here and though i know we
are a long way from that thats really what you want  you want to be able to communicate to
the public that if the data come in a little bit worse then were going to do a little bit more and if
the data come in a little bit better were going to do a little bit less  thats the kind of thing that
you want  you have that in something like a taylor rule for interest rate policy  youd like that
for asset purchases  we just havent been able to formulate something like that  id like to
encourage us to keep thinking in that direction  after all zero interest rates might go on for
several years so its not as if this situation is about to end  so i think we should still keep
thinking about that but i know that were a long way from that at this point  thank you very
much
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also support brians recommendations
on our credit and liquidity facilities  in regards to tools for exiting i am also very appreciative to
the staff for the excellent work that they did  i am now more confident that we have the tools  i
am also very much in favor of using the monetary policy report to describe the tools that are
available to us  and i prefer focusing on those tools that we currently have available to us that
dont require any legislation or other changes  i also agree with governor kohns comments that
its too soon to consider a change in policy but i also agree that its not too soon for the
committee to start talking about a frameworkor the process that were going to be usingto
decide how we are going to apply these tools
in addition i think it would be helpful for the staff and this committee to start looking at
some alternative language for use in statements that will describe this environment that we are
going to be in where we are simultaneously adjusting our fed funds target and managing the size
of our balance sheet  as president yellen stated i think that getting prepared to communicate is
just as important as getting ready to use the tools  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  ill start with our instructions to the desk on
asset purchases  i agree with governor kohn and i was going to express it the same wayfor
clarity of instructions fixing a price or fixing a quantity really cant be beat  i agree with
president bullard that a reaction function would be preferable on some grounds and if we were
able to communicate a wellunderstood one that would be great  but in this instance i just dont
think we have the time to communicate that in a way that does not add uncertainty about the
exact way in which were likely to react to incoming data  moreover i want to emphasize that i
think we should give the desk less discretion and i do that without any lack of respect for the
tremendous acumen and skill of the people on the desk  its just that it places an impossible
burden on them to operationalize our terms of art in the directive and to communicate that
coherently to markets in a way that doesnt add chatter that we dont need and that distracts us
from what were doing
as for monetizing debt were monetizing mortgagebacked securities just as much as
were monetizing debt  i think the dangerand this has been the danger this springis
conveying that the amount we monetize might vary with the amount the government issues
thats something we have to stay away from and its another reason not to go down the path of
seeking to adopt a kind of a reaction function that tries to skin a bunch of cats
as to our exit strategy i think were likely to be in this situation with zero interest rates
for a while  but i have a hard time ruling out the possibility that if the greenbooks expectation
comes true towards the end of the year there will be another gigantic sigh of relief much as we
experienced after the bottom in marchmaybe not euphoria but a turn in expectations and
sentiment that makes the world look different and makes us at least want to think about backing
away from stimulus before the end of the year  i have no idea how likely that is but i think we
need to pay attention to the amount of stimulus were providing and the effects were having  i
think we need to pay attention to the banking system in particular and to monitor bank asset
holdings and their liquid liabilities and that channel for policy  sure we were intervening in
order to reduce mbs rates and to reduce treasury yields below what they otherwise would have
been  granting that its not clear which of those two channels had the bigger effect  but we
need to be thinking about the timingwhat its going to look like when its going to be the right
time
i think that its too early to signal that were thinking about exiting but its not too early
to explain in the monetary policy report that we are thinking about what it would be like
were not thinking about doing it yet but were planning and thinking carefully about the
mechanics of it  i think that raising the interest rate on reserves seems quite likely to succeed
to my mind the most logical and natural path forward on this issue of reserve management is to
use this opportunity to back away from federal funds rate targeting  weve backed away from
nonborrowed reserves targeting  if historically by some fluke we had been targeting rp rates
over the last three decades i dont think we would have known the difference and yet rp rates
never equaled the fed funds rate  so i dont think we have a real strong reason to tie ourselves to
the federal funds rate as opposed to the rp rate  the interest rate on reserves in this regime is
going to be the relevant marginal rate for banks  so when the time comes i think we just back
away from the target explain that heres our policy rate the interest on reserves and let it go
at that
as a resultand this is sort of relatedi think we should be really hesitant to engage in
clever tinkering to try to get around problems with this as good as we seem to have been at
clever tinkering recently  so to my mind reserve collateral accounts are just not worth the
bother  in terms of changing the leverage ratio and exempting some institutions i dont think we
should tinker with supervision and regulation just to solve a monetary policy problem  i find the
guidance thing to be even murkier
im against fed bills  i dont want us to have that ability  i dont want to make us a
target for those who would want us to finance stuff  weve gotten involved in housing finance
and i think one of our biggest political problems in the next couple of years is going to be
backing away from housing finance the way we had to back away from it in the 1970s  that
transition out i think would be made more difficult if we have this offbalancesheet thing  i
was stunned to learn in the staff memos that if this had full faith and credit our books would be
consolidated with the us government  to me that has some optical characteristics that i think
are dangerous for us as an institution  wed be seen as on balance sheet and yet outside of
appropriations  so i just dont think we should go down that road
hybrid armsagain sort of clever tinkering  for us to go to these little markets and
kind of try to pick up some effect just opens us to rentseeking  maybe weve gotten good at
handling it but it just doesnt seem worth it to me
as for the facilities i would have terminated them all  laughter  i wouldnt have
initiated any of them anyway but given the boards decision im willing to go along with the
foreign central bank swap arrangement  but let me say about rescinding the gse facility that i
am wildly enthusiastic  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  ill help you with your time mr chairman  everything i believe has
already been said by one person or another
chairman bernanke  i thank you  just very quickly let me summarize a few
things  i think there was a lot of support for brians recommendations  the only issue i heard
was some discussion about raising the bid rate on the taf  you can raise the rate by cutting the
quantity or by raising the rate  i think the optics are a little bit risky to be raising the rate  i
would be inclined to go with the recommendation that the staff has put forward
on the exit strategy i guess i disagree with president lacker  i think its important for us
to have these other tools to diversify our ability to sterilize reserves  a number of things are very
interestingreverse repos collateralized lending term deposits  and we didnt talk about
redemptions but redemptions actually are part of this too  thats going to be significant over
the next couple of years  i think most people agree that it would be very valuable to have as
detailed as possible a discussion of the exit strategy in the monetary policy report  and i think
there was good support for that and we should proceed with that
finally on the desk and flexibility there didnt seem to be much interest in giving you a
great deal of flexibility  laughter  but i want to make a couple of points  one is clearly we
dont want purchases to be counterproductive so if you are overwhelming the market or
something like that you should either adjust or let the committee know about it  i think there
was also a good bit of interest in your promoting liquidity and in that respect considering
offtherun securities things of that sort  but i personally also would support lending securities
i think that just adds to the liquidity in the market  well talk more tomorrow about asset
purchases as a strategy and so on
let me just say to president plosser and president lacker that we should close the gse
lending authority  it turned out to be an inconvenient moment but we will do that as soon as we
can find an appropriate time  anything else
mr tarullo  mr chairman i think we should say for the record that brian should
draw no negative inferences from the fact that at his very first meeting president lacker suggests
that we should withdraw discretion from the desk  laughter
chairman bernanke  let that be noted  this is the latest weve ever ratified the
open market operations im sure in the history of the federal reserve  if there are no other
comments we need to take a few votes  first by the fomc to ratify domestic open market
operations
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any objections  no response  thank you  next by the
fomc to modify the authorization to allow the lending of agency debt  are there those who
would like to be recorded in opposition to that  no  without objection  thank you  the
remaining votes are on the program extensions or modifications
mr madigan  mr chairman could i recommend one change to the recommended
resolutions  the draft that was circulated indicated that the new york fed is directed to
suspend operations of the tslf options program  i recommend substituting to suspend
auctions under the tslf options program  the reason for the change is that there are options
outstanding and i dont think the intent would be to prevent those options from being exercised
chairman bernanke  noted  thank you  we need a motion to extend the swap
agreements
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  is there anyone who objects  no response  okay  the
fomc needs to extend the tslf until february 1 understanding that the schedule 1 auctions
will be suspended and the schedule 2 auctions reduced in size and that the options program will
be suspended along the lines that brian mentioned
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any objection concerns  seeing none okay  for the
board we are asked to extend the amlf the commercial paper funding facility the primary
dealer credit facility and the tslf  this includes the additional restrictions on the amlf
which boston will take care of the reduced offerings under the tslf and the tightening of
collateral conditions for the primary dealer credit facility  and we will not extend the mmiff
the money market facility  brian
mr madigan  just one additional point  on the tightening of the collateral
restrictions its likely that that will not be implemented immediately but some time in the next
several months
chairman bernanke  okay  that will be clear in the statement tomorrow  yes
okay
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any objection from the board  seeing none  finally from
the board the resolution to scale back the taf according to the schedule that brian suggested
seeing no objection  thank you very much  again well provide you with a press release as
soon as possible and it will go out on thursday at noon i believe
let us go on now to the staff presentation on the economy  michael kiley and nathan
sheets will make the presentation  whenever you are ready
mr kiley6   i will be referring to the materials that were just distributed
recent data suggest that economic activity has continued to contract but at a more moderate pace than the breathtaking declines registered around the turn of the year
as shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit job losses remained sizable through may albeit smaller than those recorded earlier in the year despite the moderation in job losses the unemployment rate jumped another  percentage point last month to 94 percent
in manufacturing the rate of decline of industrial production shown in the top right panel has lessened somewhat in recent months with the moderation in production cuts broadbased
we expect that real gdp will rise a bit in the third quarter  while the most significant factor behind the expected nearterm pickup is the progress firms especially automakers have made on adjusting inventories a topic i will return to shortly the stabilization in household demand since late last year also plays an important role  as shown in the middle left panel real consumer spending has been roughly stable since january  the stabilization in household demand is also apparent in the housing market  as shown in the middle right panel sales of existing homes

6  the materials used by messrs kiley and sheets are appended to this transcript appendix 6
through may  released earlier today and sales of new homes through april have been roughly flat since late last year
in contrast to the stabilization in household demand recent data suggest that business outlays have continued to contract  as shown in the bottom left shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft the red line continued to trend down through april  and with new orders well below shipments we expect further near term declines  we will receive information on orders and shipments through may tomorrow morning
as shown to the right we expect real gdp to fall at an annual rate of 1 percent this quarter and to rise  percent in the third quarter
the top panel of exhibit 2 lists some of the key factors shaping our mediumterm outlook  the outlook for inventories drives much of the contour over the second half of this year  as shown by the blue bars in the middle left panel firms efforts to trim bloated inventories in the first half of the year were a sizable drag on gdp  in the second half the slowing in the rate of liquidation provides an arithmetic boost to gdp growth  next year as inventories come into better balance the advance in gdp is driven primarily by final sales
returning to the box at the top several factors shape our expectation that final demand will begin to improve next year  first the stabilization in the housing market brings about an end to the drag from residential investment by early next year and we expect housing construction to turn up modestly thereafter  more broadly we expect risk premiums on corporate bonds and equities to decline further which in conjunction with the declines we have already seen and support from monetary policy contribute to gains in household wealth and a lower cost of capital
the middle right panel provides some perspective on the impact of wealth on household outlays  the declines in household wealth associated with falling house and equity prices are estimated to have placed a substantial drag on consumption expenditures both last year and this year  we expect this drag to ebb by a percentage point next year which in conjunction with improved access to credit and the effect of stabilization in the labor market on household incomes helps consumption expenditures to advance 2 percent in 2010
the bottom left panel presents the familiar accelerator mechanism where business fixed investment as a share of output shown in red tends to track with a lag the growth rate of output shown in black  we expect the deceleration in output over the past year to damp business investment through early next year thereafter equipment and software spending is expected to pick up  however spending on nonresidential structures is likely to continue to decline for some time reflecting high vacancy rates falling prices of commercial real estate and persistently tight credit conditions in that sector
putting the pieces together we project that real gdp will advance a bit more than 1 percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year and about 3 percent next year both higher than in the april greenbook  the somewhat faster pace of growth relative to april reflects the positive effects of lower risk premiums on corporate debt and equity a lower exchange value of the dollar and a modestly better outlook for foreign activity which together outweigh the heightened drag from higher mortgage rates and oil prices
your next exhibit summarizes the inflation outlook  the readings on core pce price inflation in march and april averaged  percent these gains were boosted by the response of producers to the increase in federal excise taxes on tobacco  given the news in the may cpi report we estimate that core pce prices advanced a more moderate 01 percent in may
turning to the panel at the right we project the unemployment rate to rise to
10 percent by the end of this year and to edge down a bit in the second half of 2010 we have also boosted our estimate of the nairu a touch to 5 percent reflecting the accumulation of evidence that the high rates of permanent job losses in this recession will raise the level of frictional unemployment for a time
our energy price forecast is shown in the middle left panel  with the price of oil projected to be about 15 a barrel higher on average over the projection period we anticipate somewhat more acceleration in energy prices through the middle of next year than in the previous projection
finally we expect core import price inflation shown at the middle right to pick up over the second half of this year reflecting in part the run up in nonoil commodity prices and the decline in the exchange value of the dollar
as shown by the green line in the bottom panel we expect overall pce inflation to slow from 14 percent this year to 11 percent in 2010  core inflation is projected to slow a bit more  the projected deceleration in core inflation reflects the substantial drag induced by economic slack
given the central role of economic slack in our projection the next exhibit discusses uncertainty regarding our estimates of resource utilization
the upper two panels focus on the differences in the degree of slack signaled by our current estimates of the output gap and the unemployment gapthat is the deviation of the unemployment rate from the staff estimate of the nairu  the panel to the left plots the output gap the black line and the unemployment gap the red line plotted on an inverted scale  as highlighted to the right the output and unemployment gaps typically provide similar signals this similarity is largely by construction as we use information from developments in both product and labor markets to jointly inform our estimates of potential gdp and the nairu  however
a sizable discrepancy has opened up during this recessionwith the unemployment gap suggesting an even greater degree of slack than suggested by the output gap
in the greenbook we highlighted several possible explanations for the discrepancy  first the gdp data as currently published may understate the contraction in real activity indeed the data on gross domestic income which in principle estimate overall economic activity as does gdp have been significantly weaker than gdp since 2007  second labor force participation may currently be boosted to an unusual degree by the extended unemployment compensation or euc program by the declines in wealth and their effect on the labor supply of near retirees or other workers or by other factors such as an unusual concentration of job losses among individuals with strong labor force attachment such unusual boosts to participation would have a large influence on the unemployment gap but not much effect on the estimated gdp gap  finally we may currently have underestimated the size of shifts in the nairu or other elements of potential possibly contributing to mismeasurement of slack
indeed we often change our estimate of output gaps with hindsight  the panel at the middle left shows how our current estimates of the output gap the black line differ from the initial estimates we made over the history of the last 20 years the green line such differences may reflect revisions to data changes in the staffs methodology and the fact that underlying trends are more easily detected looking backward than looking forward  nonetheless the revisions over the past two decades are not especially large the rootmeansquared error from the initial to current estimate is less than one percentage point over this period  this size of revision is much smaller than that found in some academic studies that focused on the 1970s or early 1980s
another way to assess uncertainty regarding resource utilization is to compare estimates of slack derived from different methods  as highlighted in the box at the middle right different methods will imply different estimates of potential gdp  i consider estimates from three methods  the first is the staff estimate which is loosely based on a growth accounting approach along with a number of underlying models related to productivity dynamics okuns law and the phillips curve for example  the second is a trendcycle decomposition of gdp using a simple phillips curve in which inflation is a function of the output gap a model that has been used in many academic studies  the third is derived from a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium or dsge model developed at the board  this model called edo for estimated dynamic optimizationbased model consists of a set of equations for the spending production and wage and price decisions of households and firms that are derived from utility and profitmaximization under modelconsistent expectations
the bottom panel presents the range of estimates generated by these methods the 90 percent confidence interval around this range and the staffs estimate of the output gap  three points are apparent  first uncertainty is significant the 90 percent confidence interval for the second quarter of this year spans from about 2 percent of
potential gdp to about 8 percent of potential gdp  second the staffs estimate of the output gap is in the lower half of the confidence interval but it is not the most negative estimate the estimate from the dsge model is more negative at a bit below  7 percent  finally the entire confidence interval for the output gap is below zero by the largest margin seen over the past two decades  in summary it seems highly likely that the economy currently is operating with considerable slack
your final exhibit focuses on two other risks to the inflation outlook  as discussed in the top left box and shown in the upper right longrun inflation expectations have been reasonably well anchored for some time  in our projection this prevents a sharper deceleration in inflation  however an unmooring of expectations is a risk  for example expectations could shift down markedly in response to the weak economy and decelerating wage gains alternatively expectations could ramp up perhaps in response to our expanding balance sheet
another important risk surrounding our inflation projection relates to the links between resource utilization and inflation discussed in the middle panels  inflation appears less sensitive to resource utilization than in the past for example the middle right panel presents estimates of the slope of a simple phillips curve using rolling
20year samples these show a lower sensitivity of inflation to utilization in the most recent data  this apparent reduction in sensitivity is one factor that contributed to our projection that inflation will decelerate by less than it did during earlier periods of substantial slack  but it is possible that the recent data are leading us astray because reliable identification of the slope of the phillips curve may require large movements in utilization  the post2003 estimates plotted in the chart are based on sample periods that exclude the early 1980s and they may not be a reliable guide now that we have reentered a period of high unemployment  if the effect of utilization on inflation were similar to that apparent during the early 1980s disinflation we could see deflation
the bottom panels illustrate these risks using two alternative simulations from the greenbook  in the first we assume that longrun inflation expectations corresponding to the pce price index rise 1 percentage point to 3 percent by early next year  this increase becomes partially selffulfilling and core pce inflation averages 1 percent in 2010 and then climbs steadily reaching 2 percent by 2013 given the stronger price outlook the federal funds rate lifts off from zero a year earlier than in the baseline
the second simulation labeled deflation assumes an effect of slack on inflation and an accelerationist structure to the phillips curve more consistent with models estimated over sample periods including the 1970s and early 1980s  as a result core prices are flat or falling through 2011 and only rising slowly thereafter
mr sheets  although a wide array of asset prices plays a role in our forecast the dollar holds a special place in the hearts of those of us in the international finance division  as shown in the top left panel the broad real dollar has moved down
significantly since its peak in march  as displayed in the middle panel the dollar has posted large declines in recent months against many currencies of the advanced foreign economies or afes  the dollar has also depreciated significantly against emerging market or eme currencies shown on the right which has prompted a number of these countries including brazil russia and several in emerging asia to intervene in foreign exchange markets to temper the pace of their currencys rebound notably however the dollar has essentially moved sideways since the us payrolls release on june 5 as the lessgrimthanexpected report pushed up the path of short term us interest rates relative to those abroad
although the dollar has declined substantially over the past few months it still has not reversed the sharp rise posted in the second half of 2008 and early this year as financial market participants sought refuge in us treasuries  we believe that the primary reason for the dollars recent depreciation is an unwinding of this flight to safety partly predicated on an improving outlook for the global economy  the marked rebound in some previously distressed eme currencies is consistent with this hypothesis  in addition as shown in the middle left the spreads on bbb corporate bonds have declined most steeply in the united states but elsewhere as well  and global equity prices shown on the middle right despite retreating some in recent sessions have rebounded significantly on balance in recent months
in addition to an increase in risk appetite some currenciessuch as the canadian and australian dollars and the brazilian realhave been supported by a rise in commodity prices  the spot price of wti oil the black line in the bottom left panel has jumped to nearly 70 per barrel up 15 per barrel since your last meeting and nonfuel commodity prices have increased about 10 percent on average  these rises seem to signal an incipient increase in the demand for commodities in light of recentand expected futureimprovements in global economic conditions
notably the international energy agency and the us department of energy have revised up their forecasts of global oil demand  and as shown on the bottom right the baltic dry indexa measure of bulk shipping rateshas recently moved up in line with a rebound in chinese purchases of iron ore and other commodities
some market commentary has also linked the dollars recent decline to concerns about the us fiscal outlook and the extent of treasury issuance  as seen in the first panel of your next exhibit us treasury yields have recently moved up more than sovereign yields abroad but we see this difference as largely reflecting an unwinding of flighttosafety flows  moreover although sovereign cds premiums the top right panel have increased some of late they have not risen disproportionately in the united states relative to other countries  indeed the dollar continued to depreciate against the pound even after the united kingdom was put on a credit watch by sp in midmay  other observers have attributed the dollars decline to anxieties about future us inflation but it is difficult to square this view with various measures of inflation expectations which seem reasonably well anchoredas michael kiley has shown
your next panels focus on the us external sector  as shown in the table we see net exports adding about 1 percentage point to us economic growth in the current quarter with the decline in imports continuing to outpace that of exports  thereafter net exports should subtract about  percentage point from growth in the second half of this year and a  percentage point in 2010 as the recovery of imports is seen to be somewhat stronger than that of exports
the relative strength of imports reflects several factors  first notwithstanding the dollars recent depreciation it is still up about 10 percent over the past year  in light of the long lags in our trade equations the exchange rate is likely to be a net source of stimulus for imports and drag on exports for some time  in addition as shown on the right with us and foreign gdp growth expected to proceed at roughly comparable paces through the forecast period the persistently higher income elasticity of us importsthe socalled houthakkermagee asymmetryshould also boost import growth relative to export growth
as seen in the bottom left panel the current account deficit in the first quarter narrowed to less than 3 percent of gdp the lowest reading in a decade  however our forecast calls for the deficit to widen again to about 4 percent of gdp by the end of next year  in addition to the relative strength of real imports which i just discussed the runup in oil prices plays a key role in this projection  as shown on the right panel the oil import balancewhich had improved by 300 billion in recent quartersis poised to deteriorate
your next exhibit examines the outlook for foreign activity  aggregate gdp growth abroad line 1 of the table contracted at an 8 percent annual rate in the first quarter the sharpest decline on record  but recent data have signaled that the pace of contraction slowed significantly in the second quarter and indeed have prompted us to mark up our forecast  we now expect foreign growth to rise to roughly 1 percent during the second half of this year and to around 3 percent in 2010  the recovery is expected to be rather lackluster as households and firms around the globe remain conservative in their spending decisions and the flow of credit remains anemic as financial institutions repair their balance sheets
in the advanced foreign economies recent survey data such as purchasing managers indexes are well off their recent lows and are now close to levels that signal a stabilization of activity  in addition a few pieces of socalled hard data for these countries including retail sales the right panel and industrial production not shown seem to be flattening out
consistent with these admittedly fledgling signs of stabilization our forecast for the afes line 3 in the table calls for economic growth to rise slowly from the first quarters 7 percent plunge to roughly zero in the second half of this year and to nearly 2 percent next year  this forecast is a few tenths higher than in april in line with recent data and the improvement in financial conditions  the trajectory of our forecast is also helped by a swing in the contribution from inventories in some
countries as firms have quickly drawn down their stocks in recent quarters monetary policy is another supportive factor  as you know central banks in these economies have cut rates to very low levels and are implementing unconventional policy measures in an effort to stimulate economic activity
fiscal stimulusthe bottom left panelshould also bolster activity this year  but the fiscal boost falls off markedly next year in the afes highlighting a risk that their recoveries may stall if a rebound in private demand is not well entrenched
moreover labor market conditions in these economies are likely to worsen for a while  the middle panel shows projections of unemployment rates for the foreign economies from a simple model that regresses the unemployment rate on gdp growth and lags of both variables  this framework indicates that unemployment rates abroad are likely to continue rising until well into 2010 or even later and european policymakers themselves have expressed deep concerns about the nearterm  trajectory of the labor market  consistent with these observations our forecast sees activity in the advanced foreign economies remaining quite soft with their output gaps the right panel only stabilizing next year and generally lagging the us recovery
as shown in the table at the top of your next exhibit gdp in the emerging market economies line 1 plunged at a 9 percent rate in the first quarter including a
21 percent drop in mexico line 4  gdp in these economies is projected to decline slightly in the current quarter and then gradually accelerate with growth reaching
4 percent in 2010  this recovery is supported by a projected further recovery in capital flows continued stimulus from macroeconomic policies and strengthening global demand  the mexican economy again contracted sharply in the second quarter depressed by the flu outbreak but we see those effects as being quickly reversed
the emes are showing some marked signs of improvement especially china  as seen in the middle left panel chinas pmi has moved up to a reading that our empirical work indicates is consistent with gdp growth of above 5 percent  as for harder data the 12month growth of chinese retail sales has continued to hold up well and that of fixed investment has risen to almost 40 percent fueled by fiscal stimulus and rapid bank lending  also as shown on the right electricity production and importstwo indicators that had shown marked weaknesshave rebounded vigorously of late  all told our sense is that the chinese economy is in the midst of a moderate recovery but the extent to which china will become an engine of growth for the region or for the global economy more generally remains to be seen
in other emerging market economies signs of stabilization are also becoming more apparent  as in china pmis the bottom left have bounced back from their lows in a number of emerging asian and latin american economies  industrial production the middle panel has decreased at a slower pace or even moved back up and retail sales not shown have righted themselves  this strengthening performance
appears to stem in part from an improvement in exports the right panel which have bottomed out or rebounded in many emes
brian madigan will conclude our presentation
mr madigan7   i will be referring to the separate package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections
exhibit 1 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections corresponding information about your april projections is indicated in italics and june greenbook projections are included as memo items
as shown in the upper left portion of the table your forecasts for real gdp growth in 2009 have a central tendency of 15 to 1 percent  that is an upward shift of about  to  percentage point from april reflecting increases to your projections for both halves of this year  you indicated that the upward revision was in response to the better tone of the data releases and improvements in financial conditions over the intermeeting period  your growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011 are similar to those you provided in april
even though you project higher real gdp growth over the near term all of you raised your forecasts of the unemployment rate  the central tendency in the fourth quarter of 2009 is now 98 to 101 percent about  percentage point above your april projections  you still expect that the unemployment rate will trend down during 2010 and 2011 but the levels remain about  percentage point above your april projections  many of you cited recent higherthanexpected unemployment data as the reason for the revisions  moreover each of you indicated that the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 is likely to be well above your estimate of the long run equilibrium unemployment rate
as shown in the lower half of the table recent information has led you to raise your forecasts for headline and core inflation from those in april  the central tendency of your projections for headline pce inflation in 2009 is 10 to 14 percent about  percentage point above that of april and you made small upward revisions in 2010 and 2011  many of you noted that these upward revisions reflect the influence of higherthanexpected core inflation data and higher energy prices and some pointed to higher inflation expectations  most of you still project that inflation will stay around or below your view of mandateconsistent inflation through 2011 but your expectations for inflation continue to span a wide range  some see inflation slowing through 2011 in response to persistently high economic slack while others see inflation rising above mandateconsistent inflation because of the influence of the rapid expansion of the federal reserves balance sheet on inflation expectations
over the near term your views on the outlook are broadly similar to those of the staff  greenbook projections for real gdp growth unemployment and inflation for

7  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 7
2009 are within the central tendencies of your projections  however by 2011 noticeable differences are evident  the greenbooks real gdp growth forecast for that year is above the central tendency of your projections while the staff forecasts for the unemployment rate and core inflation are below the central tendencies
several of you again noted explicitly that you do not share the staffs view of inflation dynamics
that divergence in views helps explain why more than half of you anticipate that it will be necessary to begin moving the fed funds rate up appreciably earlier than envisioned by the greenbook which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain close to the zero bound through 2011
as shown by the left panels of exhibit 2 your views on the degree of uncertainty surrounding your projections have not changed appreciably since april  almost all of you see greaterthanusual uncertainty regarding your projections of both economic growth and inflation reflecting the unusual nature of the shocks that triggered the current recession and our limited experience with nontraditional policy tools
however as shown in the righthand panels more of you now judge that the risks to growth and inflation are roughly balanced  for economic growth many of you see the recent economic and financial developments as having reduced downside risks fewer of you now judge that inflation risks are skewed to the downside and a large majority of you see inflation risks as balanced overall
mr chairman that concludes our presentation  but while i have the floor could i note that i misspoke earlier when i said that the timing of the pdcf haircuts would be announced in the press release on thursday  those haircuts arent published so it wouldnt make sense to put them in the press release  but the desk will inform the dealers at the appropriate time
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you for the presentation  questions for
our colleagues  president fisher
mr fisher  i just have some questions of nathan  you mentioned the baltic dry
index in the context of chinese iron ore imports  chinese iron ore imports are far exceeding
steel production as you know  so my question is  how sustainable in your opinion is this
recovery
mr sheets  we have reason to believe that these chinese purchases are playing a
very special role here  what is china doing with all of these commodities that theyre
purchasing  i think the answer has three parts  first some of these commodities are actually
being consumed by chinese firms in association with the fiscal stimulus thats being put in place
second some are being used to replenish inventory levels  in the fall when the chinese and
global economy hit something of a wall many firms just backed away entirely from commodity
purchases and that is one of the reasons why the bottom fell out of the commodity market  so
those inventory levels are low and theyre being brought back to normal levels  third i think
that there is some strategic purchasing going on in the chinese economy right now
commodities are cheap and theyre pretty confident that at some point theyre going to need to
use them so theyre buying things and stockpiling them
my sense is that of those three causes the first one is indicative of early stages of a
recovery in the chinese economy  i think thats probably sustainable  these inventorybased
explanations are less sustainable so it wouldnt surprise me if over time chinese purchases
flattened out or even came back from where they are today  now if that happens in the context
of a broader global recovery less demand for basic materials from china would be offset by
increased demand from other countries  but i think there is a risk that the commodity markets
have gotten ahead of themselves and that the chinese will stop buying at this furious pace and
well see a little bit of unwinding of the increases in commodity prices that weve seen over the
last few months
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  the pce energy prices seem to be
coming off in the forecast into 2010 while the oil commodity price continues to rise slightly
suggesting its nonoil energy  can you explain what the thinking is there
mr kiley  i think thats mainly just looking at rates of changes versus levels  its true
that the level in 2010 is picking up but the rate of change is decelerating because weve seen a
big runup right now in oil prices and that will be passed through over the second half of this
year
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  brian i just wanted to ask you a question
taking note of the extremely large range on the inflation forecast for core pce is this outside of
historical experience  i dont mean the history of our projectionswe havent been doing it that
long  but have we seen this kind of range among professional forecasters even taking note of
the fact that they might want to market their forecasts in a particular way because theyve got
different jobs than we do  it seems very large and frankly it challenges your ability to listen to
all of the commentary around the room in an evenkeeled way it seems to me  well thats my
reactionspeaking of shipping  laughter
mr madigan  i dont know the answer to your question president evans but it is as
i noted in my remarks fairly striking
mr stockton  just relative to the greenbook stochastic simulations or the
confidence intervals even that wide range in 2011 is within the 70 percent confidence interval of
the forecast  so its a sad statement on forecasting
chairman bernanke  fomc are not sheep  laughter  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have a question  i appreciate the
discussion about measures of slack and output gaps and i was particularly struck by the
measures that were produced by the edo model  in the bluebook your description of the
construction of the output gap is not the way i normally think of itit looks like some longrun
trend or steadystate model  most of these stochastic general equilibrium models think about
equilibrium output being at a point in time and then you get shocked away from that  the
difference between what might be produced by a sticky price model versus a flexible price model
gives you some measure of the difference between whats feasible and what you actually get
but youve defined the output gap in a much different way using what looks like some concept
of steady state and i was a little puzzled by that choice  of course in your discussion you
highlighted the fact that that actually led to the edo model having a very large output gap rather
than a somewhat smaller one  most of these dsge models lead to much more volatile measures
of what you might think of as equilibrium or potential output at a point in time  if you sort of
rethink then the range of where potential output might be in terms of what different models give
you i guess i wouldnt have selected that subset i would have selected a little different subset
mr kiley  right  a lot of that is jargon terminology  we were trying to create some
definitions that could be consistently applied across many models  so certainly in our model
theres a natural rate of output or an equilibrium rate of output that would be consistent with
economic efficiency according to that model or with the absence of wage and price rigidities
according to that model  those two wouldnt necessarily be the same  but one could have many
different definitions of the natural rate of output or the equilibrium rate of output
mr plosser  right  it depends on your model
mr kiley  weve published papers on using that model and constructing those
measures  those measures depend upon a set of assumptions regarding certain elements in the
structure of the economy that many models dont even make assumptions about  so we couldnt
compare that concept with a timeseries model like the trendcycle decomposition of gdp  nor
could we compare that necessarily with the staffs estimate in putting together potential output
the staff takes a longrun growth accounting view and doesnt think about what would happen if
for example it removed all price and wage rigidities for the economy
we wanted to place all of our models on an equal footing so we took a very standard
definition of potential output for this exercise for the edo modelthe beveridgenelson
definition  the model has a representation of the economy that has stochastic trends and unit
roots and all of these things in it and we can crank through all of that machinery and generate a
longrun forecast for output just as you could in a timeseries model or in the frbus model
or in basically any model  we considered that to be a really good thing because we can actually
use the same idea across modelswere not mixing apples and oranges
when we do that in this model theres a lot of slack right now  other models of a similar
type could give you a different answerit could be that the natural rate of output gives you a
very different answer  so you have to think about why you want to look at all of these concepts
and think about what youre comparing across different models  this seemed like the simplest
way to compare across models  in response to a different question you might want to use a
different concept
mr plosser  i guess i dont disagree with anything youve just said except that i
think its important to note that the concept of potential output is not modelfree  therefore we
have to think hard about what this construct looks like  at some level youre making some
assumptions about what that concept means and that concept can differ quite a bit across models
that one might choose from  thats what makes all of this hard in sort of figuring out what the
interpretation might be
mr kiley  thats absolutely right and i just want to clarify one thing  the definition
of potential here is a statistical definition thats consistent with the model  we didnt say
okay were going to use this statistical method for the output gap and then put it in the
model and a bunch of phillips curves or a bunch of other things  the model is completely
independent of that statistical machinery and wages and prices and everything are being driven
by all of the things that are appropriate in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model  its
trying to match the data so when you generate a statistical measure of the output gap from this
model that statistical measure will forecast low inflation because statistically thats what it
thinks happens in the data  that theoretical concept plays no role in the modelits a statistical
concept
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  the version of the output gap that president plosser was referring to as
opposed to this other statistical onethats the one that governs inflation dynamics in that
model isnt it
mr kiley  no  in a simple threeequation model thats true  but once you have
sticky prices and sticky wages monopoly power other sources of distorting shocks there is no
simple relationship between what would happen in the absence of wage and price rigidities and
what would happen to inflation  you could write down a modela very simple modelwhere
that would be true  but it need not be the case
mr lacker  but that one is related somehow in a complicated way and the one you
display is not right
mr kiley  we forecast inflation with the model ive displayed  it forecasts very low
inflation because the output gap is so big  thats not a behavioral relationship thats a
statistical regularity
mr lacker  well wait  i thought you said the model stood apart  what does this
gap measured from edo have to do with inflation dynamics in the model
mr kiley  in the model it doesnt  but the model is trying to capture the data  you
can simulate the model a million times generate data and then regress anything against anything
and you find reducedform relationships  the reducedform relationships consistent with the
model and the data are that output gaps predict low inflation  and thats a reducedform
characteristic of the model that comes from its structure  its a pretty big and complicated
model as many are these days  but because it tries to capture the data and because it looks like
thats a regularity in the data its generating that prediction
chairman bernanke  other questions  no response  all right  thank you for a
very productive discussion  dinner tonight is purely social at the british embassy at 730  well
begin tomorrow at 900 am with the goround
meeting recessed
june 24 2009morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  i think we have a report on
some data from dave stockton
mr stockton8   yes  first mr chairman i think yesterday i broke my own record
i said one thing at the meeting and it was wrong  laughter  i would like to correct that  in
response to president evanss observation about the wide dispersion of the inflation forecast in
2011 i think i said that the range of those forecasts was within the 70 percent confidence interval
that we generate using stochastic stimulations  that in fact isnt right  the range for total pce
prices is just outside the 70 percent confidence interval and the range for core pce prices is
even further outside the 70 percent confidence interval and in fact reaches the 90 percent
confidence interval  so there is an unusually wide range of forecasts out there
as for the data we received the advanced durables this morningi think you should
have the table in front of youand it was a strongerthanexpected report  shipments of
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraftthe bolded figuresrose 03 percent in may we
had actually been expecting shipments to decline about 1 percent  and orders rose more
strongly 48 percent which is a pretty solid increase pointing to a little bit less weakness going
forward in capital spending than wed been expecting  now it is still the case that orders remain
well below shipments and that overall equipment spending is still contracting but i think wed
view these data as at least being supportive of our view that the pace of that contraction in
equipment spending is lessening  were going to get new home sales data later this morning
we dont have those yet
chairman bernanke  thank you  well begin our economic goround with
president plosser

8  the materials used by mr stockton are appended to this transcript appendix 8
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  good morning  business conditions in the
third district remained relatively soft in may and early june  nevertheless the steepness of the
decline appears to have eased rather dramatically and the tone from our business contacts has
noticeably improved  while our contacts dont expect a strong upturn in business activity they
clearly see signs of stabilization in the near term
the most positive indicator from our business outlook survey which was released last
week is manufacturing and that index said that general activity improved from a minus 226 in
may to a minus 22 percent in junea 20point swing which is rather significant as these
standards go  this indicates essentially flat activity in the district now  this is considerably
stronger than some of the national industrial production numbers but consistent with some of the
other regional manufacturing surveys  our survey has a fairly long historya little longer than
richmonds i believe but im not sure  laughter  and a movement above zero in this index
likely marks the recessions trough based on past relationships between this index and nber
recession dates  the future activity index moved up quite sharply in june to levels we havent
seen in several years
the most negative factor in the district was the unemployment report  the
unemployment rate in our three states rose another 04 percentage point and now stands at
84 percent  payrolls have continued to fall and even in our surveys the employment picture
does not look terribly bright
based primarily on the expected labor market data ive revised downward slightly my
nearterm forecast for 2009 and upped my unemployment rate forecast compared with april
but i have to confess that my forecast in april was on the outlier side of positive compared with
many others  the basic shape of my forecast however remains very similar  a return to
positive economic growth in the second half of this year and recovery gaining traction in 2010
picking up to about 3 percent  this is actually similar to the greenbooks forecast which has
been revised up since our last meeting so maybe we are converging here at some point
however our inflation forecast continued to differ  i see less deflationary pressures than the
greenbook baseline and even with its upward revision to inflation i see greater risk of higher
inflation not in the near term but in the outyears
i continue to be skeptical of putting too much weight on output gaps as predictors of
inflation  my reading of the literature suggests that gaps are difficult to measure with any
precision and this may be one reason that gap measures get little weight in empirical estimations
of new keynesian phillips curve models  from the staff discussion yesterday on the range of
gap measures it appears we may have very different perceptions about how to go about
constructing the appropriate measure of potential output  nevertheless i think it was interesting
in fact the estimates reported yesterday showed a very wide range of views of what the output
gap may befrom something like minus 7 or 8 percent to minus 2 or 3 percent  we view that as
being a range of uncertainty about the magnitude of the gap  in a simple phillips curve model
that may imply a difference of between 200 and 300 basis points in what a taylor rule might
imply about the fed funds rate  thats a pretty large difference in policy stance so that may
suggest very different policies
if we are closer to the smaller measure of the output gap than to the larger measure it
also means that we may have to raise rates sooner than we might think  in philadelphias own
dsge forecasting model we actually get considerably higher inflation pressures going forward
than the greenbook baseline shows particularly if the fed funds rate stays at zero through 2012
given the difficulties in estimating and forecasting inflation i do think we need to consider
alternative forecasts seriously  with the aggressive monetary policy actions we have taken i
think this means looking at the possibility that our own inflation forecast possesses clear risks to
the upside and preparing ourselves and the public for the possibility that we may have to act
sooner rather than later  in addition the size of our balance sheet might complicate our ability to
respond as rapidly as necessary to curtail inflation pressures  and while inflation expectations
have so far remained anchored i think we have to be cognizant of the fact that this might change
if agents become convinced that projected fiscal deficits will be monetized or if we fail to act in a
timely manner  for these reasons i think we should be very cautious of being overly confident
that we can leave monetary policy accommodation in place as long as the greenbook suggests
without some very bad consequences on the inflation front
needless to say with that perspective in mind the fed funds rate path embedded in my
forecast is considerably steeper than the greenbooks which holds rates at zero through 2011  i
believe we will need to begin raising rates by early next year at the latest and throughout the
forecast horizon to at least 3 or 4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011  i dont believe we can
keep the fed funds rate at zero and expect to achieve anything close to our inflation objective or
maintain our credibility in achieving that objective over the longer run  we can say what we
please but it cannot substitute for action  our assessment of the output gap will be central to
how the committee thinks about the appropriate time to change course and begin to tighten and
we may have to do so in a fairly rapid way  if we dramatically overestimate the size and
persistence of the output gap and wait we will be too late to stem significant inflation risk
i think we also will need to monitor carefully quantities of various kinds whether it be
bank lending or other measures  in the past our operating procedures have constrained reserves
deliberately through our control of the fed funds rate and through limiting reserves to the
marketplace  now those reserves are already out there in the form of excess reserves in the
banking system  when banks decide its time to start lending again those reserves can move
from excess reserves into bank lending very quickly and they will not need to be supplied by us
as in the old operating regime  therefore i think this transition might be very quicki dont
mean days but certainly over a series of months  depending on what we view as the appropriate
equilibrium interest rate our setting for the fed funds rate or the ioer may have to move up
quite rapidly because the opportunity cost of funds in terms of bank lending may move up fairly
rapidly in the process
i think were going to face some severe challenges at the turning point when we have to
make the decision to move  it may come sooner than we think and it may have to be more rapid
than we think  i think we have to prepare ourselves for that possibility and through our
communications prepare the public for that eventuality as well  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i want to add my thanks to those of
president evans for the improved amplification  i could hear president plosser here very well
laughter
in the last two weeks because of the possible gap between reports of increasingly
optimistic sentiment and underlying reality the atlanta bank took great care to collect a lot of
input from directors business and financial contacts  reports from the business community
clearly indicate greater stability  that said the tone of these reports suggests an economy that is
still exceptionally fragile  there is not much optimism among my contacts for a strong recovery
business capital spending is being indefinitely postponed and there is little appetite for hiring
even for seasonal or temporary positions  one atlanta director a partner in a top management
consulting firm stated that they are doing very little growth work and that most of their large
corporate strategy assignments relate to positioning for subdued business conditions for the next
five years  in the financial sector banks are still very cautious in credit extension  ci loan
demand remains quite soft and mortgage demand fell sharply when mortgage rates rose above
5 percent
the outlook i submitted is little changed from late april  i expect this will be an
exceptionally slow recovery  i find the alternative simulations presented in this meetings
greenbook to be quite pertinent  my outlook has elements of the scenarios for both the slower
recovery and labor market damage  in my view a slow restoration of financial markets will limit
credit availability well into 2010 and the rebuilding of wealth is likely to be spread over several
years  these influences will inhibit the usual forces of recovery  the significant reorganization
of the economy could keep the unemployment rate elevated for years into the recovery
as regards prices the recent rise in oil and some other commodity prices could raise
inflation statistics this summer but weve also seen downward price pressure elsewhere in the
data  overall im in the camp that is not overly concerned about inflation for the medium term
i continue to think the prospect for deflation is roughly balanced against the likelihood that
inflation will accelerate above a rate consistent with price stability  but even if i am somewhat
sanguine about inflation i acknowledge a high level of uncertainty about the inflation outlook  i
also note that concern about inflation expressed anecdotally on the part of my business contacts
is clearly rising this concern seems to be connected to apprehension about how the fed will
manage its balance sheet going forward  as i see it the context of our policy discussion
involves the potential of a widening separation in public and market sentiment between the
expectation of policy reversal and exit and a more uncertain and fragile underlying reality  i am
concerned that too much talk of exit could get ahead of reality  as several said yesterday this
presents a particularly delicate communication challenge coming out of this meeting  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the reports from my district have
revealed lingering concerns about how the economy will evolve over the rest of this year  most
of my contacts agree that their worst fears for the economy seem less likely to be realized now
but they are still far from optimistic  expectations for the remainder of the year varied from
further reduction in activity levels to a very moderate resumption in economic growth  reports
of hiring are still rare and several contacts from larger companies suggest that they are working
on another round of layoffs  from my district vantage point it still looks like a very gradual
recovery process  the inflation picture is mixed  i am hearing a growing number of contacts
expressing fears of inflation driven by rising commodity prices and ballooning fiscal deficits but
i am also hearing widespread reports of downward pressures on wages and benefits
synthesizing these reports and the incoming data into an outlook continues to be
challenging  i have revised up slightly my output forecast from the april meeting as business
fixed investment although still a considerable drag on growth declines less steeply than in my
previous outlook  while business spending on equipment is likely to pick up in the second half
of the year spending on structures as was mentioned yesterday will probably take longer to
recover  some recent favorable readings from the housing indicators have also attenuated the
nearterm decline in residential investment in my outlook and have raised the prospect for a
turnaround in housing in the second half of the year  my forecast still has the unemployment
rate peaking at just over 10 percent in early 2010  the continued rapid rise in unemployment
certainly remains an important drag on the economy as new jobs are hard to find for many of the
workers who were laid off
i revised up my inflation forecast for 2009 but i left my longerterm inflation projection
on a gradual path towards 2 percent  as we discussed yesterday the latest survey of
professional forecasters has a broader variance around the longerterm inflation trend but the
median inflation projection is largely unchanged  and as we said yesterday we have seen an
unusually wide range of inflation projections in this round of the committees submissions
we know that the liquidity problems in the tips market have made that a more difficult
indicator to use to deem where inflation expectations are  we have done some work at the
cleveland fed using a different method of looking at the tips data and those results suggest
that inflation expectations have returned to precrisis levels  apparently these results have been
confirmed by the staff of the san francisco fed who used a different methodology but came to
the same conclusion  consequently although inflation expectations are still volatile i do think
that it is reasonable to characterize them as anchored
in my view the risks to the forecast remain to the downside for output because the
improvements in the real economy that we are seeing remain nascent and i think fragile
however i did revise my views of the risks around the inflation forecast to balancedthey are
large but symmetric
this remains a very challenging period to evaluate the incoming data and even a smaller
gap doesnt mitigate the fact that the economy is still contracting in the current quarter and most
projections show limited growth for a considerable period  despite my forecast for higher
inflation compared with the greenbook my overall outlook leaves the economy a fair distance
from needing a tighter monetary policy  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  over the past several weeks my key concern
about the outlook has been whether the improvements in the forecast would be sustained  were
the green shoots hardy enough to survive adverse weather  the news im hearing from my
directors and other business contacts seems tentatively consistent with this improved forecast
now being on a somewhat more solid footing  before the last meeting my contacts reported that
activity was still declining but that the pace of deterioration was slowing  now two months
later they characterize this as a stabilization that is in train  i see these comments as being in
broad agreement with the greenbooks assessment of economic activity
my discussion with the us ceo of arcelormittal is a good summary of how things are
likely improving in a number of industrial segments  the parent company is the largest steel
producer in the world  last summer steel prices peaked at over 1000 a ton and inventories
were relatively lean throughout the industry  as the recession intensified inventories climbed
and prices fell  just recently prices were down to 380 a ton which im told just covered
variable costs  since late last year the firm has cut production sharply and repeatedly  today
their capacity utilization is about 40 percent and they are running only two of their nine blast
furnace facilities  during this period steel service centers which compete by buying steel and
distributing from inventories have been running down their stocks  about three weeks ago their
destocking process seemed to end and prices have risen modestly by about 20 a ton
currently mittal sees production shipments and inventories all stabilizing  looking to the
summer their order books for july are full and theyre now deciding whether to fire up a third
blast furnace in the middle of july for august production and delivery  to justify this increase to
55 percent capacity they need sustainable future orderstodays report seems helpful
perhapsnot just the end of destocking  making this judgment about sustainability is difficult
in part because mittals chief customers today are the nonbankrupt auto companies and other
durable goods producers whose order flow can be chunky  so if gm and chrysler improve that
would further support production decisions like this
ive heard stories similar to mittals from other contacts  for example a large
diversified tool and parts manufacturer said that some of its major customers have completed
their destocking cycles although they have not yet relayed plans to begin rebuilding inventory
levels so its not showing up in higher production yet  in addition the continued restructuring
process at chrysler and gm is a positive factor for manufacturing output and particularly in our
district  these reports seem consistent with our forecast of slow to modest gdp growth in the
second half of 2009  still few businesses are reporting increasing activity and the decision to
raise production will be a close call for many firms for some time
another important element solidifying the outlook is the improvement in credit
conditions  clearly conditions continue to be challenging  many businesses report that lines of
credit are being reduced and borrowing rates are being adjusted upwards  but even businesses
who say that access to credit is still a problem acknowledge that conditions are not as restrictive
as they were a couple of months ago  highquality firms have found that debt and equity
markets have become quite receptive to new issuances and the talf appears to have been both
directly and indirectly beneficial for credit markets according to participants whom i have talked
to
on the inflation front i have been somewhat surprised that there has not been more
downward momentum so far  as the greenbook points out inflation expectations have not
moved down as expected  i did ask my staff to investigate quantitatively what the size of a labor
reallocation story might be for the natural rate of unemployment  theres a member of my staff
who has some papers on reallocation sort of a david lilienstyle measure of dispersion and how
that translates into higher nairus and she updated that unobserved components model  the
bottom line is that you can get the natural rate to move upwards of about 6 percent but its really
hard to get much more out of that  even if you went as far as 7 percent which the data do not
indicate thats still quite a large resource gap
i continue to hear a great deal of concern that our expansive provision of liquidity
largescale asset purchases and future federal deficits pose medium and longerterm risks on the
inflation front  i know we can deal with these issues in a variety of ways as we discussed
yesterday  however many of these programs do have exit costs that are somewhat larger than i
previously thought
our forecast continues to assume that resource slack and contained inflation expectations
will result in a decline in inflation over the projection period  i do thank dave for his
clarification this morning  frankly i think he was more right than not  i didnt realize looking
at the distribution that theres a cherrypicking to thisif you take out just the high and just the
low the range is about  to 2 percent  so i think thats closer to inside the 70 percent  were
not expecting as large a decline as is in the greenbook  were looking for core pce inflation to
be closer to 1 percent in 2010
finally from our januarymarch meetings to today there has been a marked reduction in
uncertainty and downside economic risks as i see it especially downside skews  in march the
abyss scenario weighed heavily on my list of concerns  so i favored what i will refer to as a
robust control approach to policymaking specifically  try many programs in substantial size
give strong credence to their possible success in spite of their uncertain impacts and hope that
some or all would provide needed accommodation  of course were not out of the woods yet
but the likelihood of the abyss scenario has declined notably  in addition ive been surprised by
the reduction in disinflationary risks  so to my mind these are very important developments
they lead me to put less weight on this robust control approach and move more towards the
conventional weighing of the expected effectiveness and cost of these programs and i do find
myself moving back towards more balanced assessments of the necessary magnitudes for various
nontraditional policies  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  like the greenbook the boston fed
forecast now expects that we will reach an unemployment rate of 10 percent  unfortunately this
statistic probably understates the degree of weakness in labor markets  in discussion with small
and mediumsized businesses in new england it is striking how many firms have placed
workers on parttime schedules and how many firms have reported reducing nominal wages to
avoid further job cuts  if new englands firms are representative of the wider economy these
practices may have implications for the recovery  first firms are likely to defer hiring not only
until they are confident that the recovery has firmly taken root but also until they have restored
hours to those workers whose hours they have already reduced  second wage pressures on
inflation are likely to continue to be subdued as firms in weak sectors of the economy defer
wage increases until demand for their products increases
in my forecast the recovery is quite restrained making it unlikely that we reach full
employment during the forecast horizon  the recovery will be slower if mortgage rates do not
encourage buyers back into the market  while the 30year mortgage rates have come down
somewhat from the recent spike they remain well above the rates earlier this spring  not
surprisingly loan applications have slowed and realtors report diminished foot traffic after the
rates increased  but higher rates may slow the recovery even further  higher rates will likely
put downward pressure on housing prices  this in turn will further diminish household wealth
reducing consumption as households seek to recover from already large wealth losses  in
addition lower house prices will likely add to the many households who struggle with the
potential of home foreclosure  as i discussed briefly yesterday an interesting aspect of the
mortgage market during this recession is that five and sevenyear arms are not priced as
attractively as they were earlier in this decade  if longerterm mortgage rates remain high
improved pricing of longerterm arms does have the potential to bring some borrowers back
into the market
while financial markets have improved they remain fragile  the municipal bond market
could still be roiled by the lack of political will by some states and municipalities to address their
financial problems  bank lending could be affected if commercial real estate and consumer
loans continue to deteriorate forcing higher loan loss reserves which for many banks are still
moving slowly relative to the growth of nonperforming loans  while the securitization market
appears to have improved somewhat as a result of the talf it is unclear how the eventual
removal of talf financing and the possible legislation on securitization are likely to affect the
recovery in this market
overall my forecast is not much different from the last fomc meeting and frankly that
forecast implies uncomfortable outcomes for both unemployment and inflation  higher
mortgage rates have caused me to push out the housing recovery and the recent labor report has
raised my path of unemployment  many banks remain capital constrained and i expect many
more to be constrained as they need to increase loan loss reserves  thus i place a low
probability on rapid expansion of bank lending over the next two years  even by the end of
2011 i expect that the unemployment rate will be well above full employment and inflation will
be well below my target  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  in the eighth federal reserve district the
decline in economic activity is slowing or stopped  still there are no immediate signs of
improvement during the summer or fall  business contacts are definitely subdued  i might even
describe them as resigned to sluggish economic performance for the foreseeable future  in recent
calls that i made there were some reports of slower activity in the second half of may and into
june so well see if that shows up in the numbers going forward  that worried me a little bit
on the national scene my sense is that markets may have jumped ahead of the reality of
the economy during the last 60 or 90 days  that said i am hoping for some improvement in the
second half but i think theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty about where the economy
will be going forward  i think were vulnerable to further shocks  shocks are unpredictable so i
dont know where they would come from  but when youre down other things can happen  i
also think that the longer that the recession drags on the greater the likelihood that new problems
can arise that would not have been problems if the economy had turned around sooner  and i
just wanted to say i remain concerned about the global nature of this recession which i think is
largely unprecedented in the postwar era
ive been concerned about possible deflation and a deflationary trap that is a steady state
that we could actually get stuck in  if we were to enter such a trap in 2009 or 2010 we would
have a very hard time getting out  the first priority for me has been to avoid this outcome and
that means building up inflation expectations  i think the probability that this will happen has
fallen some  for instance the fiveyear tips inflation compensation has increasedits about
125 basis points now  i know theres a lot of analysis about exactly how to look at that  if you
just take it at face value it has improved a lot from very negative values in december and
january but its still not a lot of inflation over the next five years  its below our inflation target
and youd like to see it higher i think  also the greenbook forecast has inflation declining
further so i dont think were out of the woods on the deflation threat although the outlook has
improved a lot from what it was in the decemberjanuary time frame
i think were entering a period of volatile expectations in markets  the markets are just
not sure what to think about the unprecedented policy environment  theyre looking at numbers
that they have not seen before and theyre not sure what to thinklarge budget deficits where
the longerterm outlook is very unclear  given that i think our purchase program looks like
and i put that in quotes  looks likedebt monetization  i dont think anybody involved wants
to go there but thats the appearance
and youve got legislation pending that may appear to threaten fed independence  i
think the hard thing about our debt markets is that theyre global markets so especially for those
outside the us who may not understand the subtleties of our politics this just looks like a lot of
debt issuance by the treasury and some purchases by the central bank  its just very hard to get
away from that perception and that has made me pessimistic about further expansion of our
largescale asset purchases
i think current policies are pushing very hard on our credibility  as i mentioned before i
dont think we could get away with these policies if we were a smaller developing country
fortunately we do have a large stock of credibility to draw upon but we need to be careful  just
because everything has gone well for a long time in the us doesnt mean it will continue to do
so this time around  again the policy response to this crisis has been unprecedented so the
current situation may not produce the outcomes that we hope for
im also concerned along with president plosser and others about the emphasis in the
narrative on a large output gap keeping inflation at bay into the indefinite future  i dont think
inflation is a nearterm problem but it could be a mediumterm problem  i also think there are
conceptual difficulties with the traditional output gap measures  the empirical relationships are
not that great  so the moment is really ripe for a possible policy mistake along this dimension
since were coupling that with our unprecedented policy action  i think thats going to remain an
issue for the fomc for some time to come  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  well mr chairman in our district clearly conditions do remain weak
but the information we are receiving suggests the contraction has lessened and expectations for
future growth have actually improved  we are seeing some reductions in residential real estate
inventories in the lowerpriced housing sector partly because house prices have adjusted and
partly because of some credits for firsttime home buyers  manufacturing continues to contract
but there are signs that the decline has moderated noticeably  our may manufacturing survey
showed that the pace of decline in production has actually reversed and in employment and
capital spending it has stabilized  preliminary results from our june survey further indicate that
we are close to almost recovery levels in terms of district manufacturing  our energy sector
having fallen pretty significantly has stabilized but we are primarily producers of natural gas so
stabilizing is about as good as we expect for any time soon  commercial real estate remains a
source of pretty considerable weakness  our directors and district business contacts indicate that
a combination of higher vacancy rates and some difficulties in obtaining financing are really
limiting that market in our region
on the national front our outlook isnt a whole lot different from that of the greenbook
except in one important way and that is that we have a more aggressive policy path for interest
rates  they increase almost a year sooner than some outlined in the greenbook  in terms of the
inflation outlook we are not seeing any pressures towards deflation and actually not seeing any
signs at this point towards inflation either  so i see the risks as fairly balanced as we go forward
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  broadly speaking district economic
conditions continue to track the national economy for the most part as is typically the case
theres pronounced weakness in business investment both in commercial construction and in
spending on equipment and software signs of stabilization in consumer spending and continued
deterioration in the labor market although recent declines in employment have not been as
severe as those at the national level  there are some encouraging signs in terms of sales activity
in the residential real estate market not related to foreclosures or short sales  and we do have a
reasonably healthy agricultural sector and a reasonably healthy energy sector
as far as the national outlook is concerned my forecast is quite similar in most respects
to the latest version of the greenbook outlook  i expect positive economic growth to resume
momentarily and to be quite subdued initially for the reasons that have been previously well
identifiedcontinued strained credit conditions negative wealth effects significant job losses
and lots of excess capacity both in the services sector and in a variety of goodsproducing
industries as well  but given the pace and depth of the downturn ive been asking myself
shouldnt we expect perhaps a more typical recovery  i havent been able to quite talk myself
into that scenario yet but i guess i wouldnt entirely dismiss it  in any event i do expect
momentum to build and growth to accelerate as we get further into 2010 and to accelerate
further in 2011 basically because the problems that i just alluded to should be diminishing over
time and were in an environment of expansionary policies
as far as inflation is concerned i continue to expect inflation to remain relatively low
given appropriate policy  and in this regard i expect that the federal funds rate will have to start
moving up in the latter half of next year or early 2011 at the latest in order to achieve that
outcome  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  fifth district economic conditions are pretty
well aligned with the national situation with activity stabilizing in some areas though at a level
thats still pretty depressed  our manufacturing index has risen above zero from deep into
negative territory and there are encouraging signs for orders shipments and to a lesser extent
capital expenditures  nevertheless services residential construction and the labor market all
remain depressed
i think it does appear that the real economy is reaching something of an inflection point
since the turn of the year real pce light motor vehicle sales and singlefamily home sales
starts and permits have leveled out and in some cases eked out small gains  initial
unemployment claims have steadied and have come off their early peak  consumer sentiment
indexes have bounced back from their lows  the ism manufacturing survey rallied as did many
regional surveys  encouragingly the new orders component poked its head above 50 and
moreover this mornings durable goods report seems pretty positive
equally heartening has been the improvement in financial market conditions  equity
prices for financial institutions are up significantly from their lows in early march  bank cds
spreads have declined  a wide range of large banks have successfully issued equity and
nonfdic guaranteed debt  threemonth dollar libor rates are below 1 percent  tripleb
corporate bond yields are just below 8 percent off from their 2008 yearend highs of 10 percent
i think all of this suggests a substantial reduction in risk premiums  and because the extent to
which bank liabilities are government supported hasnt changed materially over the horizon the
improvement is probably due to a better outlook for fundamentals
at the same time these signs of stabilization do not by any means guarantee vigorous
economic growth any time soon and i dont think they will prevent unexpected shocks
obviously  the stabilization in housing starts and auto sales is encouraging but its occurring at
extraordinarily low levels  the outlook for commercial real estate is not goodfurther increases
in vacancies delinquencies and loan losses are in store  and many banks face further increases
in credit card losses and commercial real estate losses as well  while at this point it looks as if
these familiar features of cyclical downturns are going to prove manageable they do suggest that
we have a ways to go before the downturn is over and growth may be slow for a while
since december core pce inflation excluding tobacco has come in fairly close to
1 percent  but even though energy prices helped us late last year gasoline prices have been
increasing steadily over the last few months  weve seen a consistent pattern over the last
several years of increases in energy prices followed by smaller but noticeable increases in core
inflation with a lag of a couple of months  this pattern makes me skeptical of the greenbooks
forecast that core pce inflation is going to fall significantly over the next couple of months and
quarters  and it leads me to expect core inflation to remain where it is or if anything to rise
over the next few months
core inflation has been reasonably well behaved so far this year  worries about future
inflation have become disappointingly common over the last few months among financial market
participants and among my contactspeople raise it independently  and a couple of presidents
have cited concerns that link that to what people see happening to our balance sheet  i think
concerns about sustained deflation have evaporated more or less and measures of inflation
expectations have increased noticeably obviously since our last meeting  theyre back to levels
consistent with those we saw before the middle of last year levels we associated with price
stability  market commentary speculated about the possibilitywe talked about this a lot
yesterdaythat the fed will come under pressure to monetize future deficits given the currently
unsustainable upward path they seem to be on
weve been reasonably clear about our planned purchases but we provided much less
information i think about our reaction function  i think thats an inevitable byproduct of the
urge to preserve discretion and this is an example of the extent to which discretion can be the
enemy of clarity  that lack of clarity i think contributed to the beliefand maybe its not a
predominant belief but it is something you hearthat we might be setting a ceiling on longterm
interest rates kind of the way we did before the 1951 accord a period when monetary policy
was very inflationary  in this context the signs of stabilization in the real economy and financial
markets make it unlikely that we could announce additional open market purchases without
aggravating market concerns about inflation  but more broadly whatever we do with the
statement at this meeting i think we should strive to add clarity
about exit i think its too soon to hint that its imminent but at the same time i think
there would be a great benefit in clarifying the extent to which we believe we know how it would
work and how we could accomplish that  and thats sort of the delicate balance to strike in the
monetary policy report i think  thank you very much mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  at our meeting in late april we had begun
to see hopeful signs of impending economic recovery and subsequent economic and financial
developments have strengthened the view that the economy is bottoming out  even so the
outlook over the next several years remains disturbing  my modal forecast shows economic
growth resuming next quarter but i expect the recovery to be quite gradual  the output and
employment gaps are at a minimum quite large so it will take a long time to regain full
employment under current monetary and fiscal policy settings  although downside risks have
diminished i remain concerned that the recovery is still fragile
the news on housing has been good  a broad array of data shows signs of stabilization
but the recent sharp rise in mortgage rates makes me worry about the future  several of my
directors and advisory council members who are connected with the housing sector stress that the
improved outlook for housing remains precariously tied to mortgage rates
recent data on consumer sentiment and spending show improvement due in part to the
fiscal stimulus  even so i continue to hear a flood of downbeat anecdotes on household buying
patterns  my contacts tell me that demand remains weak and that firms are cutting prices to
generate sales putting profit margins under tremendous pressure  they note that consumers are
continuing to shift from highercost discretionary items to lowercost necessities  a major
discount retailer reports that for the first time in his memory consumers are passing up bulk
purchases of food and other staples at discount prices in favor of smaller packages with higher
unit prices because they cant come up with the money to carry the associated inventory  this
suggests very tight liquidity constraints  consumers seem particularly concerned about the
tightening of credit card limits
and of course labor markets continue to deteriorate badly  its a sign of how bad things
really are that near euphoria broke out with the announcement of 345000 nonfarm jobs lost in
may  the unemployment rate is soaring month by month and even worse it appears to
understate the true extent of the deterioration given the unusually high incidence of permanent
as opposed to temporary layoffs and the unprecedented increase in involuntary parttime work
on the bright side overall financial conditions have certainly improved since we last met
that bodes well for recovery  its encouraging that so many banks have been able to raise
private capital and in many respects market stress has subsided  the combination of falling risk
spreads on bonds higher stock prices higher treasury rates and a lower dollar seems consistent
with a greater appetite for risk probably stemming from the positive tone of emerging economic
data  this development should be constructive for growth overall but as i said i hope that the
associated rise in mortgage interest rates doesnt reverberate too strongly  with foreclosures on
the rise and house prices still falling higher borrowing costs could stall the emerging rebound in
residential construction further impairing financial institutions and markets and thereby
hampering the recovery more broadly
my forecasts for output and employment are similar to the greenbooks so i wont go
into the details  i do want to emphasize that i anticipate a rather sluggish recovery not the rapid
vshaped recovery we have frequently seen following deep recessions in the past  the process
of balance sheet repair that households and financial institutions are undergoing will result in
subdued spending for an extended period and monetary policies here and abroad are not able to
play as big a role as usual in promoting recovery because of the constraint of the zero lower
bound on shortterm interest rates
given the uncertainties in the outlook i very much appreciated the range of well
designed alternative simulations presented in the greenbook  i noticed that even under the
typical recovery simulation which has much stronger growth than in the baseline the
unemployment rate remains well above the 5 percent nairu by the end of 2011 and inflation
hovers around 1 percent  this outcome reflects the large unemployment and gdp gaps
estimated for the first quarter  with a gdp gap of about 5 percent the economy is in a deep
hole and it will take a long time to climb out even if growth is rapid  this is a key
consideration in designing optimal policy
my forecast contains an estimate of the output gap similar to the greenbooks but im
well aware that the size of the gap is uncertain and sensitive to the precise methodology thats
used  so for this forecast round we assessed the level of the gap from a variety of different
perspectives to see if any central tendency emerged  the analysis that we carried out turns out to
be very close to what mike kiley described in yesterdays briefing and what the board heard in
the briefings that you had on monday  obviously great minds think alike and i know president
evans and his staff in chicago were doing exactly the same things that we did and the board did
so i wont go into all of the details  ill just say we reverse engineered wage and price phillips
curves to estimate the level of the gdp gap that would produce the inflation rates now being
observed  we used a variety of wage and price measures to assess sensitivity  we investigated
whether a possible decline in the efficiency of the jobmatching process might be raising the
nairu by comparing crossindustry dispersion of employment growth in this cycle with earlier
ones  and we too assessed the evidence relating to the beveridge curve and possible shifts  i
simply want to second or third the conclusions that board staff reached and that president evans
described  it is possible to find reasonable methodologies that would lead to a shortrun nairu
higher than that used by the board or to output gaps that are somewhat smaller than those that
are embodied in the greenbook or in our forecast  but no matter what methodology is used in
every case we find very substantial slack in labor and product markets
id like to discuss briefly one thing that we did  we looked at whether the financial crisis
and the large sectoral reallocations away from housing finance and autos may have slowed
underlying total factor productivity growth and thereby the pace of potential output growth  if
so our forecast of output growth going forward could be too large  although measured tfp has
declined over the past year or so which is typical of past recessions we find that adjusted for
the utilization of labor and capital it has actually risen strongly during the recession  the
conclusion that underlying productivity growth has remained on or actually above trend is
confirmed using an alternative approach of estimating permanent technology shocks from the
productivity data
so to conclude if the recovery is as slow as the greenbook and i expect it will take
quite a number of years to get back to potential output  as a result i expect core inflation to drift
lower over the next few years falling below the 2 percent rate that seems best to me
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  i recently accompanied my wife to a board
meeting of the american film institute of which she is a director in president yellens district
in hollywood and to prepare for that trip i read evelyn waughs wonderful novel the loved
one an angloamerican tragedy  the plot line is about a minor british poet who goes to write
the greatest movie of all time about the life of percy shelley and settles for employment at a pet
cemetery called the happy hunting ground  theres a precious scene in that novel where the
tough head of the film studio is surrounded by people around a table and in the back benches
the people around the table are described as yes men and those on the back benches as
nodders  i find myself nodding and saying yeslaughterto everything that has been said
by my predecessors at this table  there is a unanimity of view it seems to me that as president
yellen just pointed out the economy is bottoming out but it is a gradual and fragile recovery
and it will take a long time to regain employment  i forecast an almost checkmarkshaped
recovery which is a long recovery as president rosengren stated with the unemployment rate
masking some of the problems we have with our workforce and i do not foresee a very quick
recovery
what concerns me is that the people that i talk to the ceo list that i give you and even
the people we talked to in that part of the country which is not known for being plugged into
reality also have a unanimous view  i want to touch on two aspects that were mentioned by my
predecessors here  the first is with regard to president rosengrens point that unemployment
may be masking deeper problems  even in your district president rosengren i noticed that
harvard law school just sent out a letter recommending that their graduating class seek
employment in other fieldsperhaps at pet cemeteries im not quite sure  laughter  if you
look at skadden arps or cravath swaine  moore people that i talk to they have deferred an
entire class in terms of their hiring  so heres the point  i think we also need to be cognizant of
the fact that the service sector is going to have a very slow recovery in the process  this was
underscored by the ceo of att who said if it isnt life or death were not hiring anybody
or investing in anything  and i think thats pretty much a unanimous view around the table of
ceos that i spoke to
second president lockhart mentioned capex  capex is being postponed  when you
have excess slack youre going to have less commitment to capex  but heres the point i want
to mention  among the ceos that i speak to and even people that you would never expect to be
criticalill drop a name because it was absolutely shocking warren beatty for example
theres a unanimous worry that the plethora of programs coming out of washington is creating
enormous uncertainty  uncertainty is the enemy of decisionmaking the enemy of capitalism
weve talked about this before  its not that changes are being proposed  its that no one knows
when they will stop and i find that this has heightened uncertainty in the business sector and is
retarding capex  and that wont change until there is resolution about the enormous changes
that have been proposed by the congress by the administration and so on  its not that the
business community and others are against the proposals its that there are so many coming so
quickly that its creating enormous uncertainty  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  is this the warren beatty who starred in reds  laughter
mr fisher  also heaven can wait  laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  well hopefully heaven cant wait too long  laughter
i just want to amplify what president fisher said about the uncertainty created by all of the
obama administration initiatives  we heard from one large firm that this is really important
especially in health care  why would you build a new wing of a hospital if you dont know what
the reimbursement rates are going to be
generally i think the economy is still very weak  i think were probably at or very close
to a cyclical bottom  the market reaction though is really mostly to my mind about pricing
out the tail risk of a depression rather than pricing in a strong recovery and i think the market
over the last week or two has sort of been rethinking its reaction  what has been going on in the
labor market is pretty striking  the rise in the participation rate may be indicative of stress in
terms of balance sheets and people being forced back into the labor market even though the
prospects arent very good
past credit crises certainly suggest that the dynamics of recovery this time will be very
different  the wealth shock is unprecedented  credit availability is going to be constrained for
quite a while  there are significant rollover risks for large groups of borrowersthe commercial
mortgage market is probably the most significant one  and its going to take several years i
think for the financial system to get back to more normal functioning
one thing that struck me in looking at the macro data is how weve been benefiting from
unusually favorable income dynamics up to now  if you look at the trend of income relative to
hours worked and wages real disposable income growth has been very very strong6 percent
at an annual rate in the first quarter and on pace by the new york fed forecast for a 42 percent
annual rise in the second quarter  that has allowed the saving rate to rise sharply without
triggering a big fall in consumer spending  the problem is that the factors underlying the sharp
rise are all behind us  the big increase in transfer payments automatic stabilizers the large
cola for social security caused by the big runup in energy prices last year the tax cuts
changes in withholding rates in april and payments made to social security recipients in may
and june
looking forward the trend in real disposable income is going to be much worse in the
second half of the yearwere probably going to see actual declines  so were assuming that
consumption will rise despite the fact that disposable personal income is falling and the saving
rate will fall as a consequence  but i think there is a risk to the downside because maybe the
saving rate wont fall and consumption will just be weaker than we anticipated
the other thing i am worried about is this  i think its very premature to rule out further
financial market disruptions  a couple of times in the crisis weve thought that things were
getting better and then there was another shock  obviously when lehman failed we had no
idea what the macroeconomic consequences of that were going to be  one thing i am worried
about is that the tlgp is almost certainly going to end september 30 so that means financial
institutions are going to face more rollover risk for all the debt thats coming due after
september 30  and we still have several very large systemically important institutions that are
very fragile and that have broad international operations  we dont have a resolution mechanism
to deal with them if they get into difficulties  and the political will to help these firms if they do
get into trouble i think is quite a bit subdued compared to what it was a year ago  so i think
thats something to be concerned about
on inflation i think the nearterm outlook is that core inflation is going to moderate from
where it has been  the tobacco taxes are sort of a funny anomalyhow you raise taxes
shouldnt really affect the inflation numbers but it does in certain cases  inflation expectations
seem to be well anchored despite some worries about monetization of the debt and we have a
very large output gap  to make sure that we keep inflation expectations well anchored i think
we need to do more in articulating why will be able to exit smoothly  the biggest upside risk on
inflation to me would be a broad loss of confidence in the us abroad caused by worries about
fiscal sustainability and the independence of the fed  the only way i can see getting a big
inflation problem any time soon is if the dollar were to collapse  theres probably some risk of
that but i think it should be very low as long as we communicate clearly that we have the tools
to manage our exit smoothly and that we are committed to longterm price stability regardless of
what the fiscal authorities do  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  data since the last meeting along with what
we have heard around this table and reports from the reserve bank districts should give us
much more confidence that the economy is indeed in the process of bottoming out  and i think
basically what were seeing is that the sources of weakness are abating  weve got consumption
leveling out housing demand leveling out and eventually investment should follow that process
maybe were seeing a little bit of that in todays meeting  the inventory cycle is further along
with stocks being reducednot as much today dave i guess as we might have anticipated but
theyre still being reducedand theyll come into better alignment with sales  at that point
more of current sales and any increase in sales will need to be met from increases in production
and ultimately increases in employment setting in motion a positive accelerator multiplier
process  commodity prices are rising anticipating increasing demand and sentiment has come
back from a very very weak level  of course as many have pointed out importantly in
financial markets we see narrowing spreads rising equity prices access to markets for banks
raising equity and access to bond markets for businesses  so i think theres a lot of news that
suggests that the economy is indeed stabilizing  but like many others around the table i dont
see many signs that theres a rebound in economic activity yet nor do i see signs that the
rebound when it comes will be other than quite moderate  so i have strengthened my outlook a
little bit relative to april but not by much and it has still got the same basic pattern which is
very similar to the greenbook
i think there are a couple of forces that will be holding back the recovery  as a number
of you have mentioned one of them is in the financial sector  weve had encouraging news on
financial conditions and financial repair over the intermeeting period  but i think the underlying
problems are severe and structural  further improvement is likely to be gradual  the markets
that seem to be working well are the plain vanilla markets like corporate bonds where risks are
more easily judged  but even there risk premiums remain quite high by historical standards
the costs of debt and equity capital are elevated  securitization markets away from government
support are still held back by uncertainty both about the legal regulatory frameworkand i think
that uncertainty has probably been increasing in recent weeks with various proposalsand about
the economy  i think the securitization markets are particularly sensitive to economic
uncertainty because the risk characteristics of securitized debt are more complicated  those
problems arent going to go away quickly  more credit is going to have to flow through banks
banks continue to face constraints on balance sheet capacitytheyre using the capital they raise
to repay the government not to expand loans  losses will be mounting in coming quarters on
commercial real estate and consumer loans and i think credit supply will be slow to ease and
spreads of bank lending rates relative to cost of funds will remain elevated as earnings and
capital are restored
many of the innovations that enabled households to shift consumption over time
particularly to bring consumption forward when wealth rose will be much more limited in
availabilityhome equity lines of credit subprime credit of all typesand markets remain
fragile  i think the tentative positive interactions between financial conditions and economic
conditions that weve seen over the last few days and months can be easily disrupted by some
bad news  so credit supplies will be limited and risk spreads will shrink gradually only slowly
reflecting the full effects of the low federal funds rate and our crediteasing actions
even aside from the credit effects i think global aggregate demand is likely to recover
gradually  like president bullard im really struck by the global nature of this downturn  i
think households and businesses will remain very cautious everywhere following the unpleasant
surprises of recent quarters  president fishers comments about uncertainty holding back both
consumption and investment are well taken  and uncertainty about the course of the economy
about the availability of jobs and business earnings will abate slowly  many areas of the world
are lagging our cycle  i worry especially about europe which faces very sharp increases in
unemployment and problems in the banking sector that theyre only beginning to acknowledge
and confront
also there are issues about where the global demand is going to come from over the
medium term  us households will not be the engine of global demand as they have been for
the last fifteen years as those households rebuild wealth  staff has roughly stable saving rates
for the us  i think theyre more likely to trend higher than lower after the recent experience
and even with stable but higher saving rates in the us it is not clear what will fill the global
aggregate demand gap  the lack of domestic demand in asiathe chairmans global saving
gluthas been holding down equilibrium real rates in recent years and thats not going to
change very rapidly  stronger demand in asia ultimately depends on structural reforms in the
chinese economy especially and especially in its financial sector  so i dont expect any rapid
reduction in the dependence on exportled growth from asian countries  and were reaching the
limits of fiscal policy to fill demand gapsdemographics and entitlement concerns everywhere
are raising questions about fiscal sustainability and will constrain fiscal impetus
its always hard to see what will spark a recovery at the bottom of a recession and we
could be pleasantly surprised this time too  but my best judgment is that these factors are
holding down the equilibrium real interest rates to very low perhaps negative levels at a time
when the ability of monetary policy around the world to lower rates well below equilibrium is
severely limited by the zero nominal bound and by low inflation  in these circumstances i see a
large output gap persisting and putting downward pressure on inflation  i agree that the gap is
unobservable and that we can make mistakes in gauging it  there are also important points
about resourceshifting which raises the nairu temporarily  but i was very impressed by
mike kileys charts and by president evanss and president yellens comments  i think weve
got a sizable output gap right now by almost any measure both in the labor market and in the
product market  i think a lot of indirect evidence is consistent with that sizable gap especially in
the labor market  most measures of labor compensation have decelerated sharply in recent
months and quarters
to be sure inflation hasnt come down as fast as expected reflecting in part higher
energy prices and special factors  the tendency for some inflation expectation measures to edge
higher is troubling and we need to pay very careful attention to that in our policymaking
productivity growth has been surprisingly rapid  the staff doesnt interpret the very rapid
growth in productivity in the first half of this year as a pickup in the underlying trend but rather
as a change in cyclical characteristics  but surely the rapid productivity growth we seem to be
experiencing doesnt suggest a slowdown in trend growth and cost pressures from unit labor
costs should remain subdued  with the global output gap large competition will be intense and
there will be little pricing power for business or labor  so like many others i forecast a slowing
in inflation albeit not as much as in the staff forecast
so on balance i see persistent output gaps and inflation falling below my 2 percent
objective over the next few years  my forecast like that of the greenbook is that we dont do
very well against either of our dual objectives  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i thought i would talk briefly about the real
economy then financial markets and then inflation in that order
on the real economy in terms of nearterm growth and employment prospects like many
of you i think gdp growth looks shaky through yearend  the arithmetic of gdp may yield a
positive quarter or two but i see very little evidence that that will be enduring or at least
something that is a strong foundation on which to build  president fisher was much chagrined
yesterday to park his shiny new car next to what he described as my clunker and he suggested
that i take the government up on its generous 4500 voucher  ive decided my answer is yes
so ill do my part i think in the third quarter  laughter
unemployment is walking if not running away as presidents rosengren and yellen
suggested  i suspect that the trend in unemployment is likely to create a political demand for
consideration of a new fiscal package  i think the debate on that will be hugely consequential
not necessarily in terms of the economy but in terms of getting further market attention on fiscal
sustainability
downside risks to this rather weak forecast i think are in place both with respect to
nonus growth and nonus financial market improvements to which i think president
dudley made good reference  in terms of mediumterm growth prospects i also see downside
risks as prostability policies proliferate  i think unemployment is likely to be more
determinative of the shape of this recovery than the path of housing prices or other asset prices
and i share the views expressed by many that nairu looks as if its trending higher  i raise that
not really to quibble about the size of the output gap but rather to suggest that the reallocation
between capital and labor is likely to last longer and that the incomes in this economy in the
medium term are probably less reliable given the emerging mix of macroeconomic policies  i
compliment dave and his staff for continued work on the labor market damage scenario which i
think is more real than we wish to imagine
internationally it strikes me that there is much more complacency about where things
stand on the global economy than i would have expected  when we talk to bank regulators and
large banks elsewhere around the world theres almost a nostalgia about the events of last fall
and many of them have not gone through the capitalraising that our banks have  i think we are
rightly uncertain as both bill and don suggested about the risks to us institutions  but i think
the risks look to me at least as high if not higher for banks elsewhere in the world and im
really struck by the fact that they are seeming to race back to the good old days at capital levels
that look to me quite low with expectations for gdp growth in their home countries which i
think are likely to disappoint
decoupling which i thought we had proved over the course of the last year was a myth
proliferated by wall street seems to have found its way back into financial markets and to
economists traveling around the world  there is a view that well even if the us bumbles
along china has figured out how to be a strong growth engine for asia and europe is getting
traction in and of itself  in my view we have one global integrated economy and those who
think that somehow these other engines of growth are sufficient to get us through this nearterm
weakness i think are likely to be disappointed
on the financial market side the capitalraising that came out of the stress test results is
nothing short of impressive  that is 75 billion to keep us away from sunday night meetings so
that has got to make us feel a little bit better  the capital and corporate equity and debt markets
are as open as theyve been since this crisis began  but having said all of that i must say im a
little troubled that markets dont seem to be discriminating  id be more confident if there were
more differentiation between and among assets in the us or between us assets and nonus
assets  it looks to me as though the kind of market discipline which i have described as being
back and punitive seems to have stepped back for a while  and there are a whole lot of
lemmings that seem to be chasing indexes and buying into everything  so im not as
comfortable as i wish i were about this bounce off the bottom in asset prices everywhere around
the world since the march 9 lows
as i think was described by bill and others what were seeing in these markets i would
rationalize as an abatement of the panic rather than a sign of robust recovery  these asset prices
strike me as not yet having found a new sustainable equilibrium so the summer could test the
value of these asset prices  i put a little emphasis on this because it does strike me that the
increase of say 30 percent on average in asset values from spring until now might be more
consequential than all of the fiscal stimulus packages in trying to help get this economy going
again  and to the extent that those wealth effects are reversed i think thats likely to be hugely
consequential
we talked a little bit yesterday about treasury markets  i would only say that in the
intermeeting period i think the move up in treasury yields is for both benign and less benign
reasonsits hard for me to differentiate exactly which carries the day
finally on the inflation front as many have suggested i think the dashboard indicates
some normalization of inflation readings consistent with marking down prospects of deflation
rightly in my view  we can see higher inflation compensation in the tips market and elsewhere
still inflation expectations remain seemingly well anchored even though we have now seen in
markets both inflation and deflation scares that have gotten their attention and maybe gotten
some of ours too
id just end with a sort of thought experiment much of which we could carry on in
round 2  if we had this weak current economy and this set of projections that weve all
forwarded for consideration and public disclosure but had not had the panic and the
extraordinary fearinducing moments of the last year where would policy be  would our
prospects for policy be different  or are we keeping our policy accommodation at the
extraordinary levels in part because of what weve endured  im not sure i know the answers to
those questions but they are things i will continue to think about  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  the banks have settled down a little bit since
the stress test  they report the stress tests were not all that terrible and they were as surprised as
i was at the ease of the capital raise  theyre looking for opportunities now to raise debt
theres no trust preferred available and a couple were issuing investment units one had a
common equity and a convertible bond component and another reported having to add warrants
to debt in order to attract investors
all would like to pay back the tarp and theyre divided into those who most likely will
not be able to soon and those who can  for those who will not soon theyre not sure that theyre
out of the woods and they acknowledge that they wouldnt survive being wrong  those who
have or will soon pay back cite worries about losing their top revenue producers the cost of the
government capital the fact that new investors who are providing capital want them to get out
andprobably the most honest responsebecause everybody else is getting out
in terms of liquidity they are moving down to or up to 100 percent loandeposit ratios
those with higher ratios are shedding credit and those with lower ratios are the beneficiaries of
that  deposits are still growing but at a much slower rate and interestingly in discussing their
liquidity they all pointed to their excess funds on deposit with the federal reserve  so again i
dont see any indication that bankers are concerned about excess reserves right now  in fact
they think theyre creating them
in terms of profitability margins are finally improving  reserves are still growing
expenses are down except for fdic assessments  fee income is flat  mortgage income was
huge in the first two quarters but refinance activity in particular has slowed dramatically with
the higher rates
in terms of credit management the long process of working through residential problems
continues  construction lending has plateaued or a little bit better  oreo properties are
moving although there are still problem areas such as lots in arizona and condos in florida
ci is actually holding up  a few banks mention noticeable problems with small businesses and
said that momandpop stores are simply giving up  their classifications are growing as the
financial statements come in and show the expected lower profitability but theyre still not
showing up in delinquencies  in terms of commercial real estate its getting worse but it still
seems manageable  the bottom is not falling out  loans are classified but not yet charging off
in terms of office buildings as the leases renew rents are being negotiated down and one banker
who had just worked through his residential construction was dismayed to find that the offices he
had financed were full of real estate companies  laughter  in terms of retail theres a lot of
fallout among the smaller tenants and there are problems with the anchors the anchor tenants
can renegotiate because theres a clause that gives all of the smaller tenants an out if they lose the
anchor tenants  so the anchor tenants are absolutely taking advantage of the ability to negotiate
down  and then finally we asked about the auto dealers and they are i think pretty successful
at moving the inventory but they are left with debt on special use properties
in terms of new lending highquality credits are paying down and demand is all from
lowquality credits  one banker said he was willing to battle the examiners over his own weaker
credits but he was not willing to take on someone elses so if someone is turned down at their
primary bank theyre unlike to find a home anywhere else  there are lots of problems with
appraisals  in particular there are not enough recent comparables  many banks are exiting some
products some geographies some industries as well as creditonly relationships although risk
pricing is the best in ten years
so im left to wonder how we finance this recovery  staff recently helped me use the
flowoffunds data to look for the drop in credit so far and we found that the drop in credit up to
this point has not been nearly what you might have expected and has actually been in the middle
to the upper range of past credit crunch recessions  i believe that the support provided to the
financial system kept it from dropping but that support is now steadily being withdrawn if not
intentionally then through stigmatization  so i believe the credit crunch is still to come  many
many bank balance sheets are still supported by government capital and liquidity  this credit
cycle also will leave plenty of credit impairment wreckage behind  the bankers and their
examiners are very very riskaverse  i think business credit is going to hold up better as
profitability will probably come back with the improvement of sales as well as the fallout of
competitors but consumer credit is going to be impaired for a long while  the number of
bankruptcies delinquencies foreclosures and chargeoffs the fact that the same credit score
now equates to a much higher risk and the fact that collateral values are significantly lower will
all contribute to less credit available to consumers
most importantly there are a number of broken business models  while i do believe that
we need new business models in these times the transition is likely to be much more painful than
we currently anticipate and i see it in two areas  the first area is mortgage lending where
theres no visibility on what is going to happen with the gse system and there is yet no
securitization 20 on the horizonso i dont see what happens in terms of housing finance  the
second area is credit cards  this may be a second smaller wave of problems similar to the
subprime mortgage crisis  as i hear anecdotes of people who are in trouble on their mortgages i
am struck by the number of stories that include phenomenal amounts of credit card debt
30000 50000 100000built up by taking on more and more cards with increasing lines
then reloading by refinancing a first mortgage or an equity line and starting again  just as the
subprime market failed when refinance stopped credit chargeoffs are going to grow as the
availability of larger lines additional cards and debt consolidation loans disappears  this is fed
by the current business model for credit cards which was a land grant model  the issuers would
cast a wide net trolling for new customers using teaser rates and additional lines and then they
would underwrite and price after acquisition of those customers pricing for profitability by
testing price increases on a sample of customers with similar characteristics and then increasing
the profit by balancing the higher interest income with lost customers and writeoffs  line
management included a discovery that the highest limit becomes the primary card so line
increases were based primarily on propensity to spend and propensity to carry balances offset by
the higher credit risk
new restrictions both in our regulations and in legislation now will require that they
underwrite in advance and im not quite sure whether this means underwrite the ability to carry
the interest or the ability to pay off in the traditional three to fiveyear time frame  i dont know
what capacity to repay will do  combined with record chargeoff levels estimates are for a
reduction of 25 to 30 percent in availability  if we have nearly 1 trillion in outstanding this
could be a reduction in credit available of 200 to 250 billion combined with an inability to
reload through equity loans or home refinance  indeed the second most cited reason for home
equity was to refinance credit card debt
so what does this do to the saving rate if those most likely to finance deficit spending can
no longer do so  i had written down here that i dont know yet but fortunately governor kohn
president yellen and the vice chairman have all suggested the possible impact of this reduction
in credit  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  listening to the 15 of you who have
preceded me this morning i am struck by the fact that the central tendency of our economic
analyses may be even narrower than that suggested in the projections that were gathered in
advance of this meeting  so although mr chairman its your job and not mine to summarize i
think much of what im going to say necessarily reiterates much of what has already been said
first the recent hopeful signs of stabilization cannot obscure the fact that economic
conditions remain poor  even some of the hopeful signs themselves reveal how bad things are
as many of you have noted improvements in financial market conditions are still quite
dependent on governmentprovided liquidity facilities and guarantees  the recent rise in housing
starts follows a precipitous multiyear decline and it could yet be blunted by rising mortgage
rates
recent developments in the labor market have also been cited as cause for guarded
optimism but again as many of you have noted the news is not all good  in fact the news is not
good at all its just less bad  the decline in initial unemployment claims and the reduction in
job losses over the last couple of months are surely welcome but unemployment claims are still
at very high levels and we are still losing jobs in the economy just at a reduced rate
meanwhile the unemployment rate continues its apparently inexorable rise towards double
digits  the rate of involuntary nonfulltime employment has more than doubled in the last
eighteen months and the level of aggregate hours worked continues to decline  since december
2007 the ranks of unemployed americans have swelled by seven million  analogous points
could be made about industrial production retail sales or just about any other economic
indicator  so let me end this first point by noting that whatever the merits of the protagonists in
the great debate on the correct measure of the output gap the number is clearly large
my second point again i think reflecting what many of you have already said is that
there continue to be many reasons to believe that recovery when it does come will be slow and
fragile  i have now been tutored by governor duke to listen to the words that recur the most
during a conversation and this morning sluggish was high among them  although this is not a
particularly controversial observation i think its one that bears repeating as we consider our
policy trajectories going forward  as many of us have noted previously background
circumstances suggest an elongated recovery  economic downturns that begin with a financial
crisis have historically been more painful and with longer recovery periods than other serious
recessions  households financial institutions and other firms are all repairing their balance
sheets in reaction to big reductions in asset values and large debt overhangs  this response
while understandable and in many respects necessary leans against the stimulus provided by
increased government spending  some headwinds are even more apparent than at our last
meeting  even as were heartened by market reception of the scap process and by the
significant capital raises of many of the scap institutions we must also note that overall bank
lending is still declining  moreover the list of banks slated for closure grows longer each week
as does the list of problem banks that i receive once a week  as some of you around this table
have been predicting the difficulties in commercial real estate markets are growing and may
soon be felt with a vengeance at many regional and smaller banks
expectations of an uneven and gradual recovery are reinforced when one looks abroad
as in the united states signals from europe are mixed albeit on a somewhat lagged basis but
there are as here drags upon renewed growth when growth does come  the effects of the
smaller stimulus programs in europe will dissipate more quickly than in the us  also
conditions within a number of european banking systems are still not well known  the apparent
reluctance of many countries to conduct and report publicly on their own stress tests has stoked
concerns that weakness in real estate eastern europe and other exposures are weighing heavily
upon some of these institutions
several of you have already mentioned china  china is frequently cited as one bright
spot in a world economic canvas that is otherwise dark gray but it too actually presents a more
ambiguous case  while the size and speed of chinas stimulus package has produced impressive
results in bringing its gdp growth above 7 percent there is little evidence that china or for that
matter other east asian nations are adjusting their growth models toward greater emphasis on
domestic consumption  they seem to be using infrastructure and other stimulus spending as a
kind of holding pattern apparently expecting a significant rebound of consumption in the united
states and europe  thus even the chinese recovery may have limited selfsustaining
momentum  the continued and i fear misplaced faith in the resurgence of the old exportled
growth model is captured in the image of about 400 empty container ships parked in singapore
awaiting a return to the old normalcy
like everyone i welcome the indications of stabilization and in some areas bottoming
out  few would deny that we are significantly better situated than just a couple of months ago
however we should not be carried away with optimism or too hastily moved towards the exits
in the current circumstances of a significant output gap rising unemployment uneven
improvement in financial markets and firms and uncertain prospects abroad inflationary
pressures are neither evident nor likely to be generated within the us economy any time soon
while i do not expect to double dip i dont think it can be ruled out entirely either  the
economy remains unusually vulnerable to exogenous shocks or to renewed stress at one or more
significant financial firms  this is the most serious economic slump since the depression and it
is far from over  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  this is a good time for a coffee break of about
20 minutes
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay lets recommence  i have a summary which i will
read to you  most participants saw a slowing contraction and tentative signs of stabilization in
economic activity  business and household confidence has improved some and surveys show
improved expectations for the future  inventory liquidation continues which is a positive for
growth later this year and financial markets have continued to improve  despite this relatively
good news though most saw the economy as still quite weak and fragile and vulnerable to new
shocks  labor markets are extremely soft and financial markets may be ahead of themselves
while output should begin to grow again the pace is likely to be quite slow and tentative
although downside risks have been mitigated somewhat they still exist  likewise recovery
abroad seems likely to be uneven and gradual with europe still facing financial problems and
east asia still too reliant on exports
consumer spending though no longer declining is not robust either reflecting the weak
labor market sharp wealth reductions and higher oil prices  real income growth is likely to
slow for the remainder of the year  consumers continue to focus on necessities and appear
liquidity constrained  housing has shown a few signs of life but is vulnerable to the effects of
the rising mortgage rates and continuing high rates of foreclosure  capital investment remains
very soft reflecting unused capacity and uncertainty about the economy and about the policy
environment  across industries weakness is widespread and includes service industries
although some areas such as energy and agriculture are doing better
labor markets remain a particular area of concern  despite some improvement in new
and continuing ui claims and a less bad payroll report for may the unemployment rate and the
rate of job loss remained high with little nearterm prospect for improvement  workweeks are
shorter  total hours of work have fallen significantly  more layoffs are permanent and the
amount of involuntary parttime work is high  i should add that participation rates have risen
also because of wealth effects  slow wage growth is reflecting this weakness  the nairu may
have risen somewhat but a significant unemployment gap still probably exists
financial markets continue to show improvement  the banking stress tests were
perceived to be successful and resulted in capital raises and improved funding conditions  loan
volumes are not falling especially dramatically but in part this reflects government support
which may be withdrawn  reduced lending and tighter terms also reflect worsening credit
quality and banks still face substantial credit losses in coming quarters  other credit markets
also continue to improve including the corporate market and the abs market  the financing of
commercial real estate remains problematic however and fundamentals for the sector are
weakening  improvements in financial markets support the stabilization of the broader economy
but could prove fleeting if the projected strengthening in growth and profits does not materialize
higher oil and commodity prices will raise headline inflation in the near term while core
inflation seems likely to be low  as noted wages continue to remain nearly flat and
productivity has been surprisingly high so that the growth in unit labor costs is moderate
overall inflation seems likely to be well controlled in the near term and most see deflation risks
as now relatively small  some were concerned about inflation expectations in the medium term
as measured by tips breakevens and by most household and business surveys inflation
expectations seem to be stable at reasonable levels  however publicity about fiscal deficits and
the feds balance sheet has concerned many in the public and may be reflected in inflation risk
premiums and longerterm interest rates  communication about the exit strategy and the feds
commitment to price stability is an important tool for managing expectations  at the same time
some suggest that it is important not to signal that the unwinding of the feds extraordinary
measures is imminent
thats my summary of what i heard which i do think was a fairly consistent message
around the table today
let me just add a few thoughts which will not be particularly novel given all that has
been said  first i think one cant help but be at least somewhat encouraged by the developments
in financial markets since our last meeting  the federal reserve staff and leadership i think
deserve some credit for the assessment of the banking system and the results that that had  its
very encouraging that banks can raise equity and that their funding has improvedcds spreads
have declined  i think that although systemic risk is still around it is much less now than it was
a few months ago and the reduced probability of a major calamity in the financial system is in
itself i think a positive  weve also seen improvements as i mentioned in other credit markets
as well partly because of government support including fed programs
obviously an important development in the financial markets in the intermeeting period
was the increase in longterm interest rates  yesterday when the staff showed the changes in
government rates across a number of industrial countries i thought it was interesting that the
increase in the uk rate was about the same as the increase in the german rate both of which
were much less than the us rate  since the uk is viewed as having many of the same
problems in terms of fiscal sustainability and the balance sheet that we have the fact that those
rates had risen no more than rates in germany suggests to me that a lot of whats happening in
the us is the result of a stronger outlook and a reversal of the flighttoquality flows which in
itself is i think encouraging
so again i think one of the better developments of the intermeeting period is the broad
based improvement in financial markets  having said that as someone already mentioned
weve been headfaked on this before  i recall october 2007 when our statement essentially
declared the financial crisis to be over and again in the summer of 2008 when we were
expecting growth and recovery and then we got hit with calamities in september and october
so i do think we need to be very cautious and recognize that the financial improvements are in
some sense discounting progress that is expected in the future  and until we see concrete
evidence of that progress we shouldnt overreact to the financial improvements
as many people have noted the explicit evidence even for stabilization much less for
recovery is not really at hand yet  for example consumption growth in the second quarter is
still likely to have been negative and there are a number of drags that continue to be an issue
there  in the labor markets many have noted very severe conditions  although ui claims have
come down a bit theyre still at extraordinarily high levels and we would expect to see
continuing job losses for some time  in housing mortgage rates and foreclosures are going to be
a drag on the very tentative improvement
i think my message is that we should be encouraged by the financial improvements but
note that they are very contingent  they depend on the realization of actual improvement in the
economy  we have seen some stabilization but the evidence of solid stabilization or the
beginnings of growth is certainly not here yet and we should not overestimate that evidence  its
also important to keep in mind that although were accustomed to thinking about the stages of
the cycle and to think about growth rates the amplitude of the shock was extraordinarily large
so we are very far away by any measure i think from normalcy  even if the economy does
begin to grow at a slow pace well be very far from full employment for some time which has
implications  the longer youre away from full employment the worse credit losses will be the
worse hysteresis will be in the labor market the worse income effects will be on consumers and
so on  so the size of the decline also will have effects that could lead to a longer persistence as
well  so again i think we should be somewhat cautious about declaring victory
inflationi heard both sides of this argument  i guess the standard view would be that
core inflation at least is likely to continue to moderate  there were a number of special factors
besides the tobacco taxes  there were some unusual aspects of the change in model year for
automobiles which probably raised inflation in the last few months  so i would expect that to be
relatively soft  its consistent with very slow growth in nominal wages  also theres
productivity growth which keeps unit labor costs under control
inflation expectations are a somewhat different matter as others have mentioned  what
has happened so farnamely that inflation has come back up to more normal levelsi take as a
success not a problem  deflation risks were a concern  within reason an increase in inflation
expectations reduces real interest rates and reduces debt burdens and is actually positive  of
course as many people have noted we dont want too much of a good thingwe dont want to
go further  higher inflation rates besides being a problem for price stability probably have
negative effects on growth as well  for example higher nominal mortgage rates tend to raise
nominal payments which could have effects on the demand for housing  so i agree with
president plosser and others that we do have to pay very close attention to inflation expectations
and that our communication will be very important  in that respect i think that the careful
description of our exit strategy in the monetary policy report and the humphreyhawkins will
be important  and all of us should continue to emphasize our ability to withdraw the stimulus
and to maintain our focus on price stability  let me stop there and ask brian to turn to the policy
round
mr madigan  thank you mr chairman before i begin let me note that carol low has available a corrected version of the chart from yesterday that had the date axis labeled incorrectly9
the bluebook presented three monetary policy alternatives for your considerationalternatives a b and cas well as a variant of alternative b labeled b  on monday we provided revised drafts of the accompanying statements  those drafts along with the committees april statement are included in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives10
a choice of alternative a page 2 could be motivated by a view that the current settings of policy instrumentsa near zero fed funds rate for an extended period the current specification of the committees largescale asset purchases and the terms and conditions of the federal reserves credit and liquidity programsare unlikely to produce an outcome consistent with the dual mandate especially given the recent backup in long rates  your projections indicate that many of you anticipate economic weakness persisting for several years the central tendency of your unemployment projections at the end of 2011 is 8 to 8 percent and most of you see inflation in 2011 below rates that you consider to be consistent with price stability  moreover many of you see very slow convergence beyond that with at least five committee participants anticipating that it will take the economy more than five to six years to return to a balanced growth path  furthermore a substantial minority consider the risks to economic growth to be skewed to the downside
with both a modal outlook for weak growth and low inflation and downside risks around the outlook for activity macroeconomic considerations would seem to argue for providing additional monetary policy stimulus at this juncture  however with the federal funds rate at the zero bound the committee has limited policy options at its disposal  one of those options is to step up its largescale asset purchases  but as discussed yesterday the committees scope for increasing its largescale asset purchases is also somewhat constrained  the desk judges that purchases of agency debt securities if anything should be cut back from the currently specified amount of up to 200 billion  and the committee could encounter increasing difficulties in buying agency mortgagebacked securities without distorting interest rate spreads particularly if the recent backup in long rates persists and reduces the volume of mortgage refinancing and gross mbs issuance
in these circumstances the committee might be left with treasury securities as the only asset readily available for increased purchase  alternative a specifies that the committee would increase its purchases of treasury securities by 450 billion

9  the corrected materials for mr carpenters briefing are appended to this transcript appendix 9
10  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 10
with market participants according to the desks primary dealer survey putting only small odds on an increase in purchases staff estimates suggest that such an announcement might reduce longerterm interest rates by  to  percentage point
the staff further estimates that by the end of 2011 a reduction in longterm rates by this amount could be sufficient to lower the unemployment rate by 02 to
04 percentage point
however in its consideration of expanded asset purchases the committee would need to weigh certain other factors  first despite the staffs estimates you might be skeptical about the effects of asset purchases  or you may simply be quite uncertain about those effects and prefer to wait for further evidence  also market perceptions of debt monetization and risks to inflation expectations that could accompany such an expansion are a worry  if the projections made by many of you turn out to be correct inflation will remain quite subdued and any inflation scare should subside but at this point with the economic outlook improved you may see appropriate risk management as calling for waiting before considering further action  a related concern is that you yourselves might not be completely confident that the federal reserve will have the technical tools to execute an exit strategy at the appropriate time particularly with an even larger balance sheet than is expected under the current program of asset purchases  in addition as noted yesterday the federal reserve could also experience reduced income and diminished remittances to the treasury or capital losses even with currently planned asset purchases and an expansion of these purchases could amplify such losses
alternative a incorporates another option for providing additional policy stimulus  the committee could be more explicit about the period of time over which it expects to hold shortterm interest rates at exceptionally low levels this might be an alternative means of putting downward pressure on longerterm interest rates and spurring aggregate demand that would not involve further asset purchases  in particular the bracketed language in paragraph 3 notes that rather than simply reiterating the april indication that the committee anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period you could instead indicate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through
mid2010  this more specific formulation might help limit the extent to which markets price in an earlier start to firming than the committee currently sees as likely such a statement would take the committee in a direction that several other central banksthe bank of canada the reserve bank of new zealand and the riksbank have already taken  two notes provided to the committee by the international finance division explored the experience of those central banks with these more explicitly contingent commitments  the staff concluded that at least on balance in these three cases the commitments seemed to have had limited effects on market pricing in part because they were perceived as providing little new information to the market
the first and second paragraphs of the statement language for alternative a would set forth the motivation for further action at this meeting particularly by citing the recent backup in bond yields  the first paragraph would note that although conditions in financial markets have generally improved the committee judges that further monetary policy stimulus is warranted to help ensure that the sharp rise in some longerterm interest rates over recent months does not undermine a recovery in overall economic activity  and the second paragraph would indicate that the committee still sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term repeating language used in its last three policy statements
however if you see the current stance of policy as suitably balancing the various risks facing the committee you instead might be inclined to issue a statement along the lines of alternative b page 3  under this alternative the committee would continue to indicate that it expects the fed funds rate to remain exceptionally low for an extended period and it would retain the existing limits on its largescale asset purchases  the language in the first paragraph would be somewhat more upbeat than in april noting that the pace of economic contraction is slowing that financial market conditions have improved that sentiment has risen and that the inventory correction is proceeding  however the committee would temper that optimism by noting that economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time  the second paragraph would reiterate the committees expectation that inflation will remain subdued but it would omit the sentence citing the risk that inflation could persist at suboptimally low rates
the third paragraph of the revised version of alternative b is mostly similar to the corresponding paragraph in the april statement  however the second sentence indicates that the committee continues to anticipate exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate thus pushing back slightly on the expectation among some market participants of an early increase in the fed funds rate target  toward the end of the paragraph the statement no longer includes the indication that the federal reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs repeating that point no longer seems necessary  the statement continues to note that policymakers are monitoring the size and composition of the federal reserves balance sheet but it adds the thought that the federal reserve will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted consistent with tomorrows announcement of extensions and modifications to various liquidity programs
the final sentence in brackets would signal that the committee is factoring exit issues into its current policy decisions by noting that the committee will take careful account of the necessity of assuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time
market participants reportedly expect little change in todays fomc statement apart from a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook than in
april  in most respects the draft statement for alternative b is consistent with those expectations  however analysts will take note that the sentence expressing concern about downside inflation risks has been dropped  moreover even with the emphasis in the third paragraph that the committee continues to expect the fed funds rate to remain exceptionally low the bracketed final sentence if included could give the impression that the committee is preparing to remove policy accommodation sooner than markets currently expect and it is possible that this sentence in particular could prompt a noticeable backup in interest rates  you may want to express your judgments about the desirability of including this point in the upcoming goround
with the revisions to the language of alternative b since the bluebook was published the message of alternative b has become closer to that in the bluebooks alternative b  and if the bracketed sentence in the revised version of alternative b were dropped that alternative and alternative b would be substantively similar so we have dropped alternative b as a separate option  the version of alternative b without the bracketed sentence seems unlikely to prompt much market reaction
should you believe that the committee ought to prepare to reduce the degree of monetary accommodation before long you might see selection of alternative c page 4 as appropriate  of course that view would be difficult to motivate under either the greenbook forecast or the central tendency of your projections but you might see the economy as likely to be more resilient than implied by these forecasts  even more pertinently some of you have expressed concerns that the systems enlarged balance sheet its purchases of treasury securities and the extremely low federal funds rate might unmoor inflation expectations the increase in inflation compensation and in survey measures of inflation expectations over the intermeeting period might be viewed as worrisome in this regard  against this backdrop you might see a relatively nearterm exit from the very accommodative policy stance as appropriate
under this alternative the end of paragraph 1 would note explicitly the committees expectation that a gradual recovery in economic activity is likely to begin later this year  the inflation paragraph would indicate a view that inflation will remain subdued but would leave out the phrase for some time  as in the current draft of alternative b this alternative would drop the recent reference to downside inflation risk  importantly in paragraph 3 the committees expectation of the likely time frame for exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate would be changed to until late this year  this language would suggest that the committee anticipates raising the federal funds rate beginning around yearend  moreover further down in paragraph 3 the statement would now indicate that the committee anticipates that the pace of purchases of securities will taper off gradually by the end of the year this sentence would convey a clear sense that the committee does not intend to increase its asset purchases and in fact will begin to wind down its purchases of treasury securities before long  all in all such an announcement would be quite surprising to market participants and in all likelihood it would prompt a considerable backup in interest rates and substantial market volatility
a table that compares the three statements is included on the final page for your reference
chairman bernanke  thank you brian  are there questions for brian  not
seeing any questions lets start with president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  ive already highlighted some of my views
on policy yesterday and earlier today  let me just sort of clarify  my view of the outlook for the
real economy is really not much different from most peoples around the tablenearterm
weakness with modest growth returning in 2010  in fact my own forecast is for less growth in
2011 than the greenbooksa slow recovery in the economy in many respects  i dont disagree
with that
where i disagree has more to do with the nature and the specification of the phillips
curve and how that guides both our inflation forecast and its implications for policy  i dont
believe that the empirical relationship with gaps or slack is nearly as tight and predictable and
reliable as oftentimes we think it is so my concern is that we have to be careful about that  i
would remind the committee that between 1991 and 1996 the staff according to the chart they
handed out yesterday had substantial output gaps ranging from 2 to 4 percent for most of that
period and inflation hardly budgedit remained between 2 and 3 percent during that whole
period  so while i dont want to rely on anecdotal information it is true that this link between
output gaps and inflation is not a very strong one  i think we have to be cautious about relying
too heavily on that
my skepticism about the measurement of those gaps and the relationships with inflation
is most relevant for the deliberations we will have about when its time to reverse course and
how we decide when that time is  i think thats going to be a very difficult choice given the
uncertainty surrounding these relationships  a tightening cycle will inevitably occur and
choosing the right time to do it is going to be important for our future ability to achieve price
stability
i also think that historically this institution has been somewhat slow on the uptake many
times  if we rely too heavily on measures of slack in labor markets or unemployment rate gaps
we will inevitably find ourselves behind the curve because we know unemployment rates take a
long time to turn around and the economy will turn around before that  if we wait until the
unemployment rate becomes an unacceptable level to reverse course im fairly confident that we
will be well behind the curve  so my point is really about the nature of the phillips curve and
about the reliability of those estimates and about our ability to rely on them for policy decisions
during this critical time
i believe the economy is in this sort of bumpy transition from dramatic contraction
hopefully to expansion  i agree with everyone that there are substantial risks to that forecast and
we need to be conscious of those risks and those concerns  im very supportive as i said
yesterday of the staffs proposals on winding down the facilities  i am opposed to increasing our
largescale asset purchases  i think we need to be very cautious in that effort  we still have a
ways to go so we still could increase purchases if we chose to do so  and i dont believe we
ought to make decisions about adding to that volume very precipitously or quickly  i would also
hope that the argument is symmetric that is if the economy improves and evolves in the way
that many of us are hoping it will over the course of the fall then we may not necessarily have to
go to the full limit on some of these programs  i think we have to make that clear to the public as
well
a major issue i see in the policy decision today has to do with languagei think its the
communication effort thats going to be so difficult  i think ultimately we are going to have to
find a way to extract ourselves from the current language of exceptionally low levels of the
federal funds rate for an extended period  thats why i am somewhat sympathetic to the first
part of paragraph 3 in alternative c although i wouldnt be nearly as explicit about the timing in
that paragraph  until late this year  i would sort of strike that and just say for some time
even if we raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points its still exceptionally low so im not
sure that the difference between level and changes here is important
given my hesitancy and skepticism about tying our inflation forecast too tightly to slack
measures i actually am happier with paragraph 2 in alternative b than i was before in the sense
that both the persistence and size of the output gap become somewhat less dominant  i would
prefer c in that regard but i think paragraph 2 is better than the version in the bluebook that we
saw so im happy with that
i think we have some difficult choices before us in the coming quarters and it would be
helpful if we could continue to push for our inflation targeting goals  i hope that that is not off
the table and will continue to be pursued  but i do think that in the coming months and coming
quarters we are going to have to make some very difficult economic decisions and we could face
considerable political pressure in the face of that  we need to prepare ourselves for that and
prepare the markets for it  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i think we should continue now with the
announced schedule of asset purchases  i dont think expanding our purchases makes any sense
now given the stabilization of the economy the diminution of concerns about deflation and the
emergence of some scattered concerns about inflation  i agree with you that weve sort of
normalized inflation and inflation expectations at this point and were okay where we are  but
given that i dont think it makes sense to provide more stimulus
its true that our credit programs have run off more rapidly than we expected as of the
last meeting  as i discussed yesterday it means our balance sheet is smaller so you might think
that it provides less stimulus than you would otherwise expect  i outlined another perspective
where some components of borrowing respond endogenously as sort of a residual  this
perspective is based on the notion that the demand for reserves isnt perfectly elastic at current
rates  that would suggest that the degree of stimulus hasnt turned out to be much different from
what we expected it to have been  im happy that the desk didnt attempt to offset the shortfall
in the balance sheet as the discussion at our last meeting might have led them to think i would
have desired  im broadly apprehensive about the increases in reserves implied by completing
the path of asset purchases were on  as ive indicated i think the impact depends on the nature
of the demand for bank reserves  if what i outlined yesterday has some validity then at some
point all that buffer of borrowing from us goes away and then the nature of the impact of our
balance sheet expansion shifts qualitatively  now whether its quantitatively important or not i
dont think we know  we have all known that were sort of groping in the dark here as to what
the exact analytics are of this balance sheet expansion as monetary stimulus  but i think the kind
of thing i outlined yesterday deserves some consideration and it makes me apprehensive about
following all the way through on the purchases
now im not saying i have any idea about when were going to want to withdraw
stimulus or how the economy will play out  it just strikes me as plausible that we get to a state
where we need to think about exit  i dont know when that is and i cant pretend that i do  but i
think that when we do get there were going to need to be cognizant of the elasticity of demand
for reserves  in consequence i think we ought to give some consideration at the next few
meetings to lower paths for our asset purchases  if we get outcomes that are on the good side of
what we are expecting in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in a situation where we want
to pull back on what weve planned  i also think maybe a less gradual unwinding of the assets
ought to be on the table  i applaud the staff again by the way for all of the good work theyve
done so far on our exit strategy  but i think wed all admit we have a little more to do
im happy with alternative b  im happy omitting the bracketed sentence at the end  im
not quite sure what it means  im not quite sure about the extent to which we have taken account
of ensuring that our policy accommodation can be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate
time  so im not sure how wed explain it to people  and besides i think its a little too soon to
convey as i think the sentence would that we think of exit as likely to be imminent enough to
warrant our mentioning it in the statement  at the same time i do think its important as i said
earlier to convey in the monetary policy report or elsewhere that we have a grasp on this and
were working hard on it  also im happy omitting the statement in paragraph 2 about inflation
being at low levelsi think its important to acknowledge the shift in inflation outlook  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  like president lacker i favor alternative
b in both substance and wording  i think the staff captured my view with their description of
alternative b which said the slow pace of recovery is largely unavoidable in light of the nature
and severity of the global financial crisis and the time required for healing and other structural
adjustments  i think alternative b also recognizes the tentative nature of improvement in the
economy so i see it as a stay the course policy  as mentioned yesterday the balance sheet is
expected to grow to approximately 28 trillion so i think the playing out of programs as
currently designed should represent sufficient stimulus to sustain the progress weve seen
i am sympathetic to the view that was expressed by both presidents plosser and lacker
that if we see better results we should consider scaling back the lsap programs  at the same
time i think it would be a mistake to react too early and strongly to the signs of stabilization and
better financial market conditions  as many said yesterday and today we have a particularly
subtle communication task coming out of this meeting  i think we need to encourage positive
views that can be selfreinforcing to stabilization and ultimately to recovery  but i also think we
have to present a sober characterization of the state of and outlook for the economy and we
should be signaling that were not withdrawing stimulus and support for the economy at this
time  its okay i believe to signal that were thinking and planning for an eventual exit but not
initiating an exit  yesterday i supportedthough i didnt speak for itthe plan presented by
brian madigan for the expiration of the facilities and i agree that the press release should and
does emphasize the conditionality of that plan  i think much of the communication task as
discussed yesterday afternoon should be accomplished after todays statement for example in
the chairmans humphreyhawkins testimony
on the statement itself i can support it as its presented  in the revised proposal i
favored b before it was eliminated  i think it is continuous with the april statement and gives a
stay the course message  as i said earlier it accurately captures the economic conditions  i
think the inflation language is a logical update to the april language and since my forecast does
not assume an increase in the policy rate this year or next im comfortable for the time being
with the extended period language  and finally i do not support the bracketed statement that
was appended  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i can support alternative b although on
purely policy grounds i think that a strong case exists for further monetary stimulus  the
economy appears to be stabilizing and downside risk has declined but it will be many years
before the economy is close to operating at full employment  not surprisingly the bluebook
optimal policy simulation shows that the stance of policy is not even close to the optimal degree
of accommodation  as the bluebook points out unemployment is anticipated to run around
1 percentage points higher on the constrained path than on the unconstrained path for the next
three to four years and this translates into a cumulative loss on the order of 10 percent of gdp
or 1 trillion and creates a very strong case for doing everything possible to stimulate the
economy  the problem is that the obvious remaining tool largescale treasury purchases may
be less effective than hoped and may entail a variety of unquantifiable costs as we have
discussed  i wouldnt want to take an expansion of this program off the table if the economy
were to worsen but i wouldnt push for an expansion now
the bottom line for me is that we likely will need to maintain the current stance of policy
for a very long time to get back to full employment and my main concern is that markets will
anticipate and we may be tempted to withdraw our accommodation too soon thereby aborting
the recovery  christina romer recently wrote a pertinent essay for the economist on the
lessons of 1937 that you may have read  as many of you know in that year following two
years of robust recovery the federal reserve tightened policy too soon because it was worried
about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system  the economy plunged back into
depression and i believe that a parallel can be found in japans experience of the 1990s as well
so i think we need to do all that we can to avoid creating the impression that we intend to
raise the federal funds rate any time soon  for this reason i definitely prefer to drop the final
sentence in brackets in b concerning exit strategy  by bringing this issue up in the policy
statement i am afraid we will reinforce the markets impression that we may begin to tighten
policy sooner rather than later  i think discussions of exit strategy would be better handled in
testimony or speeches by the chairman  in the event that a reference is included in this
statement i have a very small wording change to propose  currently the statement refers to
taking careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be
withdrawn  the phrase can ultimately be withdrawn sounds to me like were not sure we can
do it or that we may refrain from easing policy in particular ways later on because of our concern
about our ability to withdraw  so if it is included i would prefer a more confident wording
namely ensuring that policy accommodation is ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the
appropriate time  so i would essentially change can be to is
i also have a wording suggestion to make in paragraph 1 concerning the outlook and my
objective here again is to make the statement slightly less optimistic slightly less able to be
interpreted as saying that we are anywhere close to withdrawing stimulus and in my view
slightly more balanced  i propose adding to a sentence in paragraph 1 of b to recognize that
even though financial conditions have improved on balance which is a net positive for the
outlook the increase in mortgage rates we have seen has the potential to impede recovery in the
housing market  in particular i would propose the following language  conditions in financial
markets have generally improved in recent months although the sharp rise in mortgage rates has
the potential to impede recovery in the housing market  indicators of consumer and business
sentiment and so on
i think the increase in mortgage rates has been substantial  it is one of the most important
and most discussed developments since our last meeting and it does create a risk to the outlook
i think it deserves mention in the statement as a negative factor that partially offsets what is a net
improvement  i also would argue for including it for the sake of balance  i think it parallels our
discussion in the very next sentence that says that there are some factors restraining household
spending and again in the inflation section where we mention increases in the prices of energy
and commodities as an offset to our view that inflation will remain generally subdued  so thats
a concrete suggestion
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i took some comfort from our discussion
yesterday on reserve management tools although we had discussions about these before  it does
seem as if these tools are likely to be enough to allow tightening when we need it
previously i would have thought that we would have to grapple with the problem of
getting our balance sheet in better shape and that markets would see that coming well before we
ever got to a positive federal funds rate  so i guess im more persuadedalthough the continued
staff analysis will be helpful on thisthat its likely to be more contemporaneous that is when
we decide that we need to tighten we can bring these tools to bear quickly and may not have to
signal very much in advance  i think thats very helpful because part of what were grappling
with right now is how to position ourselves for doing the tightening a few meetings or several
meetings into the future  i dont have a firm opinion really on when its likely to be the case that
well need to tighten  i think its pretty far in the future 2010 maybe
on the largescale asset purchases i guess i prefer leaving them the way they are given
the improvement in the economy  if at the next meeting we think its going to be important to
communicate about a taperingoff strategyif we are worried about the cliffi think we
probably need to decide now about how to communicate that  if we wait then the cliff is going
to be that much closer and youre not really going to be able to do this with the existing size so
if you want to maintain the existing size i think you would need to do that soon like today
probably  but its not in the statement
on the inflation forecast it does seem to me that theres a pretty wide dispersion of
forecasts for core pce in 2011 which is not that far awayso the dispersion is a bit unusual  if
you take out the high and the low then its  to 2 percent  i hope that the minutes will reflect
this diversity of opinion in a slightly robust fashion because that debate is taking place out in the
public  we all go out and face very difficult questions and even though we might feel pretty
confident about our outlook for inflation this dispersion of views is sort of a reality check as to
how we deal with that  on inflation forecasts it does seem like there is substantial resource
slack now  it has been a very deep contraction and so my own forecast is relatively low  even
if you allow for differences of nairus its a big amount of slack
but there are risks and we know the theory says that inflation expectations can take
off  that would be a key element in inflation determination and our forecast  events somewhat
beyond our controlfiscal pressures and how they are dealt with in the large number of
programs that are coming down the pike as president fisher reminded usand our balance
sheet size are adding to this risk  i think what weve been doing is appropriate but it does add to
the risk  so i think a lot of it comes down to how much confidence we have in a particular
forecast and some people are inclined to write a larger number for 2011 and others are inclined
to write down a much smaller number  i kind of prefer to take the middle course but in this
particular bimodal situation these opposing forces are difficult  so normally in a situation like
this we can fall back on timing  we dont have to do this today and in the worst case were
several meetings before the pressure erupts and mr chairman you will be providing testimony
soon in your monetary policy report and that would be a natural way to communicate that  but
it does seem as though these issues have been out there youve been out front in talking about
them  so i just dont know exactly what the likely impact is going to be from delivering that
message again
so even though the bimodal beliefs are quite different i prefer the middle course and so
i do prefer alternative b  on the particular issues for the statement im not bothered by the
bracketed statement at the end  i guess if i were going to make the best case it is that it seems
accurate that we will continue to take careful account of this  weve got the reserve
management tools  weve just had a meeting where we talked an awful lot about it  so its not
inappropriate to raise this now  the chairman and others have talked about exactly this issue
and probably have used words very similar to this  we say it in public  so what does it mean if
we dont say it here in the statement but we say it in public  well we can always ask that
question because thats not an uncommon type of omission  it does seem as if the language in
the second paragraph gets at this middle ground for inflation because we took out the part saying
something like inflation could be uncomfortably low or whatever the language was indicating
that it could be suboptimal  so im comfortable with alternative b
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  the forecast has high unemployment
rates and low inflation rates through 2011 and the greenbook forecast expects an undesirably
low inflation rate even at the end of 2013  missing both elements of the dual mandate through
2011 and possibly beyond strongly suggests to me that we should attempt to provide more
stimulus both to avoid a multiyear elevated unemployment rate and to avoid a prolonged period
of lower than desired inflation
mortgage and treasury rates have risen despite our largescale asset purchase program
the increase in treasury rates likely reflects the reduced precautionary demand for that asset as
financial markets have improved  however the increase in mortgage rates is likely to slow both
residential investment and consumption relative to what they would be if we were pushing rates
lower  there has been a reluctance to intervene more aggressively in the thirtyyear mortgage
market because it is felt that this would disrupt market functioning  but if our lsaps cannot
produce mortgage rates that are low enough to spur refinancing and new construction then we
have dramatically expanded our balance sheet with little to show for it
i believe we can and should do more  while i support alternative b i would encourage
the desk to further reduce mortgage rates relative to treasury rates  furthermore since the
market for five and sevenyear arms is already quite limited aggressive activity in arms
would restore the market and provide a lowcost alternative for some homebuyers willing to float
after five or seven years  because of the lack of activity setting a low rate in this market and
increasing volume would not disrupt market functioning  in fact it would resuscitate the market
these arms also have some appeal for our balance sheet since they mature relatively quickly
making the exit strategy easier for these assets  acting more aggressively to restore the arm
market and to further reduce the spread relative to treasuries for longermaturity mortgages
seem like appropriate steps to gain greater confidence that we will achieve both elements of our
dual mandate within a reasonable time horizon
i would emphasize that the experience of the past seven years has taught us that
conducting monetary policy in a very lowinflation environment is not as straightforward as we
might have wished  at some point we should have a fuller discussion of our inflation goal in
light of the probability of reaching the zero lower bound in the future and the difficulty in
conducting monetary policy when we are at the zero bound
in terms of whats in the statement i actually would not be for having the final sentence
we have not been communicating the path of the lsap program  i think we can taper as
appropriate without necessarily having to discuss how were going to taper it  i do prefer
president yellens languagei do think its appropriate to mention the rise in rates because it
has been quite appreciable and it has been probably the biggest news that weve had in the last
month in terms of what has been going on in the financial markets  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i dont know if were at a turning point
in economic activity although i dont think were far away  but one thing i do know is that
when youre close to or at turning points theres always a tremendous amount of uncertainty
its very difficult to read the state of the economy its very difficult to come to a conclusion with
confidence as to how the economy is going to perform going forward in this kind of
environment
the reason i mention that is that i think decisionmaking isnt going to get any easier any
time soon  i think this is going to characterize things probably for the next year and perhaps
more  in this environment with all of this uncertainty one nice rule of thumb might be to do no
harm especially since recent trends while certainly not great are better than they had been and
in some ways better than we had anticipated just a few months ago  so i wouldnt change any
policy parameters at this point with regard to purchases of longerterm assets or other parameters
that we might think about  yesterday i commented that i didnt think we had a problem
convincing market participants that we were prepared to do what it would take to restore
financial stability and ultimately economic health  i think people believe that and understand
that  im a little less convinced that they understand that we do have an exit strategy and will
execute it appropriately
against that background and to begin to address that concern i can favor either
president plossers alternative cthe one he described in the material he distributed late last
weekor alternative b as presented here with that last sentence in brackets included  its okay
with me if its modified along the lines that president yellen suggested  i dont think that
sentence will be read as if were about to change policy any time soon  as president evans
commented people have been talking about that publicly  i think that would provide reassurance
to people in the marketplace and people in the economy more generally that we are aware of the
challenge and were prepared to address it  we know were in an environment where our
balance sheet has expanded tremendously and is likely to expand further given our plans and
where theres a very expansionary fiscal policy in place with no end in sight  i think it would be
appropriate to make that point clear  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  as i noted at the end of my remarks i dont
think the central tendency that weve submitted is really a satisfactory outcome for the economy
were looking at an unemployment ratejust considering the center of the central tendencyof
about 8 percent in two and a half years and an inflation rate of 1 percent which is below the
2 percent that most of us have favored and thats probably headed lower unless the economy
picks up steam very very fast after that  i think thats why most taylor rules and the optimal
control simulations that president yellen mentioned call for negative nominal interest rates now
moreover i think from a riskmanagement perspective which we used to talk about
around here even though the risks are more balanced on either side of this sluggish recovery
now than they were i think the cost of a shortfall is greater than the cost of an overshoot  we
know how to counter inflation  weve done it before and we can do it again  but this central
tendency tells me that given the size of the shock were having trouble getting satisfactory
outcomes for output and inflation  i think the risk as president bullard pointed out is that we
could be caught in a highoutputgap lowinflation or even deflationary environment  i dont
think thats going to happen but i think theres a risk there and if we get caught in that i think
its very very difficult to figure out how to get out of it  this seemed to be much easier mr
chairman when we were lecturing japan than when were doing it ourselves  laughter
everybody had a solution for them and somehow when youre there there are a lot of
complications arent there
so of the two possible policy errorsmoving toward tightening too soon and moving too
lateim more worried that well move too soon than that well move too late  i think we can
correct that latter one  i dont think there is anything we can do about this now despite the lack
of satisfactory outcome  because of inflation sensitivity because of exit worries because of
concerns about monetization of the debt in the presence of a large and uncertain fiscal path im
not advocating more policy action today  i think we should continue with our purchases  i
would go up to the limits that weve set and i would include the armsat least a small amount
of the armsin those purchases hoping to have a positive effect on mortgage markets  i hope
our next decision is how and when to remove accommodation to remove the quantitative and
interest rate accommodation but i dont rule out the possibility that we could take future easing
actions if circumstances called for itthat would be more largescale asset purchases possibly
and to my mind lowering the interest rate on excess reserves would help as well  so i would be
careful not to say something that rules out the possibility of doing something more later  in
response to president stern id be concerned that putting that sentence in here would cast doubt
on whether were willing to use all of the tools available under the circumstances
i think that its far too soon to signal that the exit is drawing closer furthermore if were
seen as worried about the exit and looking carefully at it it will undermine our effect  i agree
with everyone elsewe need to be very very clear that we will be able to exit when we decide
to exit  but i dont think were anywhere close to making that decision  so i support the
language of alternative b without the bracketed sentence  i do think removing this sentence
about inflation being less than desirable from the second paragraph will be seen as a little bit
more hawkish a little bit more worried about inflation than we were before  i think we could
justify keeping the sentence based on the forecasts that we have from the committee but the
forecasts have been revised up and certainly the degree to which the committee expects inflation
to be less than it ideally should be has been reduced to some extent
i think its especially important to keep in the sentence about continuing to anticipate that
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for a
time  i think we need to signal to the market that even if theyve changed their expectations for
future interest rates we have not at least not appreciably
and finally on president yellens point i guess id be concerned that putting in her
whole sentence would really undermine the sense that financial conditions had improved and that
the economy was in the process of bottoming out  if we did anything i would just add
something like although mortgage interest rates have risen conditions in financial markets
have improved on balance in recent months  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i think alternative b is sensible at this
juncture  in this situation im going to argue here that its a good time to take stock and get
more informationwed like to see how this recovery develops over the summer  also i think
were able to retain alternatives for future meetings and i agree with governor kohn that we
may want to move at future meetings  so ill talk about several aspects of alternative b
on the bracketed last sentence concerning the exit strategy i agree with some of the
comments that have been made that this may be more confusing than helpful with respect to the
lsap program  we will discuss exit and as president yellen said its better discussed in
testimony  this is an inherently technical complicated thingit just will not come across in a
simple way to the general public  it takes a lot of explaining and i think it will be hard to figure
out from this sentence what is meant in terms of exit strategy  i also prefer the as warranted
language
i want to talk for just a minute about forward guidance and naming specific dates for
when we might make future interest rate moves as are contemplated in alternatives a and c
first of all i think everyone has said that we need the conditionalityyou need to know how the
economy is evolving in order to know when youre going to make a move  naming a specific
date seems to undermine that and in fact i think it might go the wrong direction  you might
essentially be preannouncing a rate increase far ahead of when you actually have the
information to decide whether you want to do that or not  of course you could always move
later and get the market to move off that but youre kind of drawing this line in the sand and
im not sure thats what the committee wants to do  i know other countries have done this  one
thing i will say about that is when you do that you do get announcement effects but thats
because you surprised the markets  thats not necessarily good policy or a good thing to do
this business of promising to keep rates lower for longer works well in models but
youre pushing very hard on this rational expectations assumption inside the modelseverybody
has great foresight about the future everybody understands theres a lot of credibilityand im
not sure that that maps into the reality of our situation  also when you say lower for longer
you mean relative to what would otherwise be the optimal policy rule and im not sure that we
actually have that embedded out there in the market  i think the effects that we might get from
further strengthening our commitment to low rates further out in the future are probably lost in
the reality of the situation that we face  i also think there are limits just because of discounting
in the futureif you promise to keep rates low far into the future then that gets discounted by
the markets the farther you go into the future
in summary i would just keep the for an extended period language at this meeting and
at future meetings  i think that taps into the amount that we can get out of that future
commitment and its doing as much as we can on that dimension
let me just make a few brief comments here about expanding the lsap  ive
characterized this as increasing the persistent components of the balance sheet so i would ignore
the components that are running off such as the taf  they are going up at a rapid rate  as i
said earlier you know there are concerns about monetizing the debt and i wont go into those
againi think thats an appearance issue not an intention on anybodys part  those perceptions
are very hard to control outside the us  i guess what i think about lsap is that we are only
about halfway through the current program  we dont really need to commit to further purchases
at this time but we have the optionality to do that later  i may be sympathetic with that later on
so right now i think its better to wait and gather information over the summer  on cliff effects
im convinced now that we can just let the program expire as scheduled and it wont have a
major market disruption  again we have conditionality to do more if we want or if it seems
necessary
let me just regale you with policy rules for largescale asset purchases  president lacker
said earlier that discretion is the enemy of clarity which i thought was shakespearesque of him
but weve not been clear about our reaction function with respect to these programs and that
makes it hard not just for the public but also for ourselves  you make a onetime announcement
and the market is wondering well will they make another announcement in six months and
another announcement six months after that  its very hard to know
i think its the committees jobi should add not the desks jobto get a reaction
function so that if unemployment or output gaps deteriorated in a certain way that would be the
case when we would do more  or the committee could set some kind of mapping for how much
we would want to do in various situations  i actually think that would help us and allow us to do
more if necessary because youd be conveying this understanding of a statecontingent path out
there in the future which is the object that we dont have right now
finally this is a lost cause but i would advocate moving the federal funds rate later in
the statement  i think it reduces emphasis on the federal funds rate as the key tool of policy
were seeing now thateverybodys wondering oh maybe youll raise rates later this year or
next year or something like that  it may be that the way things are evolving the fed funds rate
will turn out not to be our primary policy tool on the other side of this  so i think we should
think more about deemphasizing the federal funds rate  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president bullard we already moved it from the top of the
statement all the way down to paragraph 3  laughter  i thought that was a fair compromise by
the way  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  my outlook assumes that our policy
accommodation is going to continue for some time and yet the recovery is still quite prolonged
as has been noted financial market conditions have improved somewhat during the intermeeting
period but those improvements have taken place alongside of continuing significant public
policy interventions  so a little progress has been made but i think the economy needs a
considerable amount of time to cement that progress  in this environment i think we have room
to continue to evaluate the outlook and the effects of our current programs  so i support
alternative b
given brians comments about the uncertainty on how the language in the bracketed
sentence would be received i would just leave it out  given that we are going to have a
monetary policy report and that you are going to give testimony in the near future i would just
rely on those vehicles to address some of these issues more fully  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  im fine with alternative b and i would at
some pointnot today but in the futurehave a preference for c  i could work with the
language thats in the brackets but its not essential to me
obviously the economy remains weak  but as the discussion and as the projections
have indicated its also true that economic and financial conditions have improved  we expect
to see some modest improvement in economic growth perhaps in the latter part of this year and
even next year as weve discussed were now in a situation where the data are changing and
we are beginning to talk about the possibility of a turning point and in that regard i agree with
president sternthe data are mixed and they will be mixed for some time
looking toward the decisions ahead of us i think that given the mixed data and given
the experiences that we had in the fall of 2007 and in the summer of 2008 there will be an
enormous power of inertia at this table not to make that downward mistake  its hard to perceive
that the monetary and fiscal stimulus thats in place as significant it is will really carry the day
forward  were going to resist that until we actually see the data  furthermore this period of
low inflation is going to kind of reinforce our view that we should wait and we should make sure
that the recovery is strong  i think thats where we do risk the other side of this and thats how
we create inflationary issues or bubbles four or five years down the road because of this extended
period of accommodation and we shouldnt lose sight of that  i think its extremely important
with that in mind i was pleased that we had the conversation yesterday about our exit
strategy  my goals around that are that we find ourselves in a position where we can talk about
our policy rate being moved back towards neutral and we can talk about the fact that were
shrinking our balance sheet and the degree of excess reserves  i agree that we dont want to
repeat the experience of the late 1930s but that was a very blunt movement up in reserve
requirements  hopefully weve learned that lesson and would be much more sensitive and much
more gradual  given the degree of stimulus i think it will take us years to even get back close to
neutral  so the economy is going to be growing slowly but our moves back toward neutral also
will be very slow
another goal besides shrinking our balance sheet should be restoring the composition of
our balance sheet  we are now in the credit allocation business towards the housing market and
that of course gives me some pause
i do think that a case can be made for scaling back our asset purchase program doing less
than is currently authorized  when we originally began these purchases some months ago the
outlook was considerably weaker  deflation was a possibility although a small one and
financial stress was in fact elevated  with the improving economic and financial conditions
with the very significant fiscal stimulus beginning to kick in and with deflation even less of a
threat i think it would be prudent to reevaluate these purchases and determine whether we need
to go up to the total amount  that is what i mentioned yesterday about carefully reviewing that
at each meeting  i also would be very reluctant to expand the treasury purchase program
given the size of the debt that is being issued the optics on that can be nothing but harmful
going forward
so we have lots to think about in the long term and i want to begin to raise the need for
that longterm perspective today even though some decisions along those lines are still in the
future  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman im in favor of alternative b  i appreciate some of the
restructuring that was made from the previous draft  i agree with president yellen that we ought
to change the wording in that last bracketed sentence because im in favor of including that
sentence and heres why  i think the market is asking us to at least clarify that we have thought
about an exit strategy  with all due respect to brian whose work i admire enormouslyboth
brians by the wayi think we might actually get a negative market reaction unless we clarify
at least in the very general terms in which this has been described  the committee will
continue to take careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation as
janet said is or will be ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time  it
doesnt say too much  i think it tees up your congressional testimony  i agree in this sense with
president evans and president stern i certainly am not opposed to including it and in fact i
think we should include it  if we did and i would urge us to consider it then i dont think we
need to say continues to anticipate  thats a little bit too conditional  mr vice chairman i
get your pointwe are continuing to but the fact is we do anticipate  plus we use the word
continue twice in one paragraph  so i would urge you to consider mr chairman including
that last sentence  it is a truism  it is indeed a fact that we are taking account of the necessity
of ensuring that policy accommodation is or will be ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at an
appropriate time  i dont see what it costs us and i do think there is a general explicit and
implicit expectation that we do so
one other comment  i havent thought this through tremendously but i dont necessarily
disagree with president rosengrens suggestion because i think the desk ought to have some
leeway with regard to the mortgagebacked securities  as everybody in this room knows i
thought the treasury purchase program was a mistake  it was a very expensive mistake  i dont
think it has helped  i think has actually set us back a little bit and obviously i wouldnt be in
favor of extending it any further  but now that were there we might continue the program until
its done  but i think the desk might have some discretion and we might so instruct the desk
not in this statementbut they might work their way around the yield curve a bit for mortgage
backed securities and into certain types of mortgagebacked securities  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i have three points  first i think it is likely
well need to remove our policy accommodation sooner than the greenbook indicates but i think
its unlikely well begin to remove it as quickly as markets currently suggest  second given the
commitments that we have made notwithstanding the up to language on the asset purchases
while im not in favor of extending that obligation i do think we should work to achieve that
existing commitment for credibility purposes  third i support alternative b and will just make
a few comments on language  with respect to the last sentence i think it is essential that
markets understand that we are taking these exit considerations seriously  i think that is good
both for actions that we could take that are even more aggressivethat they know were taking it
with full understanding and confidence that we can exitand for actions that we have already
undertaken
having said that i dont think this is the right place to be making that argument  i dont
think our experience in the last few years in using this statement for nuance or for volume
control has proven to be the most effective way of doing so  i think we have ample opportunities
through you mr chairman to be very clear about the need for exit and these considerations
so on balance though im sympathetic to the truth of it i think it would be more prudent for
you to make this point clear and consistent in your monetary policy report and other speaking
opportunities  if the bracketed sentence were in wed be proving a little too much  to me the
fact that were now entering this into the statement does have the feel of sort of protesting  so on
balance i would favor not doing it though i am of course comfortable with the substance
i just want to flag the penultimate sentence  the federal reserve is monitoring the size
and composition of its balance sheet  i like it and i think it helps for the announcement that we
make on thursday about brian madigans recommendations which is pretty important  i think
its nice that we have a bridge to that so that market participants and reporters alike dont think
that we have in their view yet again surprised them on what the substance is  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  im going to be quite repetitive so ill be very
brief  i too am troubled by the projections not being consistent with our dual mandate
however with treasuries as the only option for expansion im not at all convinced that a
modest increase in our treasury purchases brings us that much closer to our objective  and i am
concerned about the difficulties with exiting an even larger balance sheet  so i support
alternative b and i would omit the final sentence in light of the risk that the interpretation would
be that our exit is imminent  finally i would echo president rosengrens and governor kohns
support of option arms  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor tarullo
mr tarullo  thank you mr chairman  i must confess to being somewhat
discomfited by what i see as a disconnect between the analyses of the economy which i alluded
to in the earlier goround and the fact that when it comes to policy there seems to be more
concern about the potential for inflation some years out than there is with the serious
underperformance of the economy today and for the foreseeable future
i understood our action in march to be an effort to provide further accommodation in the
circumstance of zerobound rates  i think its very difficult to make a judgment now as to
exactly what effect that has had  it does seem as president yellen mentioned earlier that there
is a strong theoretical case that the counterfactual is difficult to come by and that it is other
than statements of future intentions really the only policy tool available to us
i was somewhat attracted by not an option in the bluebook but an option included in the
june 16 memo from the two brians which was to modestly stretch out the treasury purchase
program until the end of the year  i was attracted to that for a variety of reasons  one is that it
just created a certain time symmetry in our decisionmaking because the mbs and agency debt
programs go through the end of the year  that in turn avoided what i fear is now going to be an
enormous spotlight placed upon us at the august meeting which is going to be interpreted as the
moment of truth in deciding what happens now with the largescale asset purchase programs  i
also thought that it might offset to some degree what i continue to fear is going to be the
interpretation of market actors and economic observers more generallynot simply that we
failed to expand today but within the context of the announcement to come tomorrow the
announcement likely to come from the fdic and precisely as president fisher has noted
because there seems to be a demand that we talk about scaling back the program that this
inaction will be seen as a beginning response to those demands which for obvious reasons i
think is misplaced as a policy matter  having said all of that i note that there is little or no
appetite in the rest of the open market committee for even this action and certainly not for what
was included in the bluebook as alternative a which i actually wouldnt favor at this point
either  so i would be prepared to go along with alternative b
let me now turn to the language issues in alternative b which as you can imagine also
reflect some of my concerns  like some of the earlier speakers i find that the first paragraph is a
bit too upbeat not just for the way that i read the economy but again for the conversation we
had around this table earlier this morning  its not that theres anything in there thats wrong or
that i disagree with  its not what is saidi guess its more what was left unsaid  i was trying to
figure that out overnight following dinner at the embassy and the baseball game later on in the
evening  it lacks a reference to what so many of us commented on which is our expectation of
just how slow the recovery will be when it comes  you see gradual resumption of sustainable
growth in there but the likelihood of a long period and a rather halting one at that is what came
through in much of what all seventeen of us said earlier in the day  i would welcome any
suggestions from anybody else as to how we might add that idea
the more important issue to me is the potential inclusion of the final bracketed sentence
which i think would be a significant policy mistake  and i think that for several reasons  one is
my substantive policy views which i described earlier  but probably more importantly for the
rest of you i think it would be a mistake precisely because of the way these statements are read
so im elaborating a bit on what governor warsh has said  as everybody knows anything
regarded as new in these statements is invested with enormous significance  by and large the
statement goes a little bit by incrementa word is dropped here a phrase is added there and
people kind of masticate those changes  if youve got something that is brand new something
that appears to be satisfying a demand from a certain group of market actors i think that will be
invested with enormous significance  under the circumstances i dont see that the policy
position of the open market committee is there and i for one dont think that were going to
actually get there anytime soon  i also agree with president lacker in that i have difficulty
understanding what that sentence actually means  its either a tautology in which case its not
particularly helpful or its suggesting something that i dont think weve actually done in a
policy sense  so i think its both appropriate and important for the chairman and others either
in public testimony or on background to explicate the various considerations that were reflected
in the very useful memos distributed by the staff  but i do think that this would be the story of
this open market committee meeting if it were included  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker you had a comment
mr lacker  governor tarullo you mentioned an imminent announcement by the
federal deposit insurance corporation
mr tarullo  i think theyre likely to ramp back the guarantees that theyve been
providing
mr lacker  thank you
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  the statement is one way we
communicate but we also communicate in speeches  i just want to reemphasize one more time
that its really important in our communications to distinguish between stressing how well
prepared we are to exit in the sense of having the necessary tools and actually exiting  i think
we have to be really clear on that or else we are going to confuse people into thinking were
about to exit because were talking about our ability to exit  we obviously need to demonstrate
that we have the ability to exit to keep inflation expectations well anchored  but we dont want
them to think that were going to exit soon or sooner than we actually think because that will
boost the expected path of shortterm rates which will raise longterm interest rates and
therefore choke off recovery  so its tricky
if you think of longterm rates as having three major componentsthe expected path of
real shortterm rates inflation expectations and risk premiumsyou can sort of put it in that
context  making it clear that the economy is pretty weak and that we dont think theres any
meaningful inflation risk so we can keep shortterm rates low for an extended period should put
the focus on that first component keeping the real rate path expectations well contained
making clear that we have the tools to exit smoothly so we can keep inflation in check over the
longer term should work on that second component by keeping inflation expectations well
anchored  it also should work on the third component because if we keep inflation expectations
well anchored there will be less dispersion in terms of inflation expectations and that
presumably will result in a lower risk premium  thats sort of how i think about it conceptually
in terms of the task at hand  its not easy but i think we have to be very very careful in how we
go forward communicating
in terms of the lsap program i think the tapering is not as big an issue for treasuries
because the amount of treasuries that were purchased is not that large relative to the flow of
issuance  i think we can do it without actually saying it explicitly  we can just purchase
treasuries at a little faster rate than the 300 billion rate over six months and so at the end we
wont have quite as much left so it will just taper off  the other problem with talking about
tapering is that it implies that youre done  if we start talking about tapering people say oh
theyre done  i think its premature at this stage to make strong statements about what we want
to do or not do with the purchase programs going forward especially if the environment turns
out to be worse than we expect
on the first paragraph i agree with governor tarullo  the first paragraph does sound
sort of upbeat  im not really sure how you would fix itmaybe you could try to have some
language that suggests that none of this is a real surprise  in other words the economy is
evolving pretty closely to the forecast that we actually had so the improvement is not a shock to
us  its just that there are lots of other issues still outstanding that make us worry about the
strength of the recovery over the longer term  so its a little bit upbeat relative to what i think
we really think around the table
in terms of the statement im in favor of b  on the last bracketed sentence my question
is really  does it reassure or does it make the market more worried about our ability to exit and
about the timing of exit  im really not sure  i think you could argue it both ways as people
around the table have done  my view is if were not sure we probably shouldnt include it
because i go back to what governor warsh said  this is not the greatest medium of
communication  i think i would exclude the last sentence just because im not sure how the
market will react to it  its probably better to take that up in the chairmans testimony or in the
monetary policy report or in speeches  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you everybody  i think that most of us are agreed
that given the improvement in the economy theres not much need to change our policy stance
today so we should keep our programs in place on the schedule that we have already announced
that would bring us to alternative b which i think is the right choice  most of you were
in favor of striking the last sentence  i think thats the right decision  im reminded of an
experience i had when i first took this job when we were still raising interest rates  remember
that  i told a congressional committee that the time would come eventually when we would
have to stop raising interest rates  of course the expectation of an immediate rate change went
right through the market and i was completely flabbergasted by the inability of the markets to
understand plain english  laughter  but unfortunately thats reality  so i think there would
be a risk of suggesting that we were preparing to exit  in this case we are taking very substantial
steps to address this particular issue not just in testimony  our current plan is to have a
significant description of exit strategy tools and so on in the monetary policy report which
would obviously be available to everyone in more detail than i could give in a short testimony
so i would recommend dropping the last sentence
we had some original language on tapering and i think the problem that we were having
with it was theres no way to describe our plans to taper without essentially determining at this
point that we are almost certainly going to stop  we may well do that but i think if we can
maintain that optionality for one more meeting it would probably be a good idea  i think we
could stop the treasury program flat or we could say we are doing 30 billion a month the rest
of the year or whatever but i dont think that we need to take that decision yet
two related things  president yellen supported by president rosengren brought up the
mortgage rate issue and i think she had two objectives  one was to point to an important factor
the other was to kind of tone down the cheeriness of the first paragraph  i have a specific
concern with the mortgage rate sentenceif we say that mortgage rates are a big problem thats
going to signal something about our asset purchase program im afraid so thats a concern that i
would have  but i do understand the issue about general tone  let me just raise this for
consideration  the second sentence in alternative b conditions in financial markets have
generally improved in recent months and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have
risen is obviously a very positive sentence and one that has no parallel in the april statement
we could if people like either strike the sentence entirely or perhaps to recognize that there
has been general improvement in financial markets strike the second part about consumer and
business sentiment which would change the tone a bit  i dont know if that would satisfy the
need  governor tarullo mentioned this as well  is there any response to that thought
mr tarullo  i would find striking the sentence useful  i think it would balance it a
little bit better  thank you
chairman bernanke  striking the whole sentence is everyone okay with that
mr evans  the entire sentence
chairman bernanke  no
mr lacker  i think the financial conditions have improved is worth having
vice chairman dudley  i would cut that second half of the sentence
mr stern  i would drop the second part of it
chairman bernanke  all right  so what im hearing is drop the second half is
that okay  president yellen does that sound okay
ms yellen  yes
chairman bernanke  all right  brian will end the sentence after in recent
months and strike the part about sentiment  i think that is all that was on the table  as noted it
is somewhat more upbeat  it does drop the concern about deflation although it does say
subdued for some time which is a strengthening of what we said last time  and of course it
does refer appropriately to the adjustmentsthe credit and liquidity programswhich will be
followed up on thursday  any other comments  if not debbie would you take the roll
ms danker  yes  the vote covers the statement thats in the packet that was handed
out today with two changes  one is dropping the phrase and indicators of consumer and
business sentiment have risen  the other is dropping the bracketed sentence at the bottom
in addition the vote covers the directive from page 69 of the bluebook with one
amendment  that directive had included the sentence stating that the desk is expected to
purchase at least 500 billion in agency mbs by the end of the second quarter of this year
given that it is june 24 and they already have purchased 500 billion that sentence has now
been changed to the desk is expected to purchase up to 125 trillion of agency mbs by the
end of the year  so it just covers the full year amount
chairman bernanke              yes vice chairman dudley        yes
governor duke                     yes
president evans                    yes
governor kohn                    yes
president lacker                   yes
president lockhart               yes
governor tarullo                  yes
governor warsh                   yes
president yellen                   yes
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  the next meeting is tuesday and
wednesday august 11 and 12  let me remind you that you have until 500 pm tomorrow to
submit any revisions to your projections based on data that you had available at the meeting
at this point i will formally adjourn the meeting  lunch is available if youd like to
come  those of you who have to leave by all means do so  but those of you who are able to
stay i would be happy to talk a bit about the regulatory reform plan and its implications for the
fed and then we can have some discussion of that informally  thank you
end of meeting
