chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  the next item on the
agenda is the selection of a federal reserve bank to execute transactions for the system open
market account  sorry am i on the wrong item here  is that a different order  okay  im
sorry i missed an item  item 2 is a proposed revision to the program for security of fomc
information  you received a memo from scott alvarez and debbie danker  this appeared to be
mostly minor procedural changes to the rules  the most substantive change was a rule affecting
the access to confidential information of people who are not regular employeesie
consultants  are there any questions for scott or debbie or any comments  a motion please
mr kohn  so move
participant  second
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  all right  now we go on to
item 3 selection of a federal reserve bank to operate the soma  in a shocking development
the federal reserve bank of new york has again expressed willingness to serve in this capacity
laughter  in this context i would like to take note of a memo that was sent to the committee
by louise roseman and the division of reserve bank operations about their assessment of the
controls and procedures related to the soma and the management of the various new facilities
they found that those controls were effective and that the soma activities complied with
established directives guidelines and procedures  so i think the report we have is that new
york is doing a fine job and should continue to carry out this function  may i have a motion
please
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  second  comment  without objection  thank you
item 4 is the selection of the manager of the system open market account  we now have
changing leadership in new york and therefore we are not quite ready to select a permanent
manager or to vote  prior to the meeting i appointed trish mosser as temporary manager of the
open market desk  we will come back to the committee for a vote when a permanent position
is established
okay  now that trish is here she gets to do some work i guess  we have three items
5 6 and 7  a proposed revision to the authorization for domestic open market operations a
proposed revision to the authorization for foreigncurrency operations and a proposed treatment
of the guidelines for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency issues
trish could you talk about all three of those briefly please
ms mosser  certainly  i would be happy to  thank you mr chairman  the
proposed changes were discussed in a memo that went out to the committee last week as well as
in a memo that proposed a slight amendment to the domestic authorization that was circulated
yesterday  let me start with the foreigncurrency area for which there are three distinct parts to
consider  with respect to the authorization for foreigncurrency operations we propose keeping
the 2008 authorization mostly unchanged  we have one modest alteration  we propose adding
four additional currencies to the list of permissible foreign exchange purchases and salesthe
australian dollar the brazilian real the korean won and the new zealand dollar  this is being
done to reflect the foreign exchange swap agreements that were put in place in 2008 with the
central banks  on the foreigncurrency directive we are currently recommending no changes
regarding the procedural instructions with respect to foreigncurrency operations we are
proposing a slight modification to the introductory paragraph adding the words unless
otherwise directed by the committee to recognize explicitly that the instructions can be
superseded by the committee  i can pause now for a vote on the foreign side or i can continue
on and talk about the rest
chairman bernanke  could you go through all three please
ms mosser  sure  i would be happy to  with respect to the authorization for
domestic open market operations we are proposing several amendments  the specific changes
include first minor changes to consolidate language for repo and reverse repo operations into a
single paragraph second the addition of a new paragraph 2 that codifies the new york feds
authority to transact in agency mortgagebacked securities for the soma portfolio using agents
such as asset managers and a custodial bank  this paragraph also allows the custodial agent to
engage in repo transactions in order to manage the cash balances that are generated by agency
mbs holdings  third we are adding language in the final paragraph as suggested by a reserve
bank president that makes explicit the authority of the soma manager following instructions
from the chairman to take actions that result in material changes in the composition and size of
the assets in the system open market account  this authority however would be subject to
the requirements set out in the last sentence of the paragraph that the chairman consult with the
committee if feasible  it would also make clear that any such adjustment shall be made in the
context of the committees discussion and decision at its most recent meeting  the intended
effect of the proposed revisions is to place the governance of intermeeting changes by the
chairman in the size and the composition of the soma portfolio on the same footing as changes
in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and the fed funds rate
last in light of the federal reserves current program of purchases of agency debt and
agency mbs the staff recommends that the guidelines for agency debt and agency mbs
purchases be temporarily suspended  the status of the guidelines will then be reviewed at next
years january fomc meeting  i should note that there is a precedent for this  for example
paragraphs 3 through 6 of this document were temporarily suspended by the committee in
august 1999  at the time the soma manager was concerned about the desks capacity to
respond to any y2k yearend effects and sought the authority to accept agency debt and agency
mbs collateral
chairman bernanke  thank you  i would like to comment on the implications of
items 5 and 7 in particular for our gse purchase program  in late november as you know i
directed the open market desk to begin a program of purchasing mbs and agency debt based
on the authorizations to do that and a consultation by phone that don and i had with all the
members of the fomc  at the time i felt comfortable with that decision  since then given
how central the mbs purchase program has become to our policy and given the issues of
governance that have been raised and we have all discussed i now believe that i made a mistake
in doing thati should have consulted more closely and then taken a vote of the fomc  so i
want to pledge to you that i will not take any similar actions in the future without a formal
consultation  now the effect of item 5 is essentially to make that part of the rules  item 5 puts
the substantial changes in the portfolio on the same footing as a change in the federal funds
rateie the strong presumption is that this will be done in formal consultation with the
committee and that the chairman retains the right to make intermeeting adjustments but only in
situations where consultation is not feasible  again i believe this is the right direction in which
to go and i support making that change
on item 7 on the guidelines for purchases of agencies i think this is a useful
clarification  i also support this  but i would like to at least record that in my own view i dont
think that our mbs purchase program is credit allocation in the sense that this guideline was
intended to addressfor several reasons  first to my mind credit allocation involves a
preference for a certain class of borrowers relative to what normally functioning markets would
throw up  in this case the issue is not an attempt to distort allocations away from some efficient
outcome rather it is our intention to try to make markets work better and to bring us closer to a
normal market outcome  second i view the mbs purchase program as being really very close to
monetary policy in spirit and intent in that we are trying to address broad issues of
macroeconomic stability by stimulating an important component of aggregate demand  so we
are using this particular tool not because we have a preference for housing but because we are
trying to stimulate overall aggregate demand  indeed as you know we are in fact looking at
various types of credit in order to achieve that  i think this is similar to the normal use of
monetary policy which affects different sectors differently not because we have a preference for
one sector or another but because our tools allow us to address different components of
aggregate demand with different force
i am saying all of this because i do have this view and i want to get it out on the table
nevertheless i think it is a clarification and useful for us to formally suspend these guidelines
for the time being  that is my take  let me open the floor for comments and questions on any
of these three items  president fisher
mr fisher  first mr chairman i think this may be the first time that a wellesley
woman has had responsibility for the trading desk  i am married to a wellesley woman  i am
used to being tutored by a wellesley woman  laughter  so i have two questions that i would
like to ask just out of ignorance  the first is about the 65day rule particularlyand i may not
understand thisbut in paragraph 1b and then paragraph 4 the requirement to resell after
65 days or less does that apply in the case of mbs or not
ms mosser  no
mr fisher  okay  then the second  is the limit on 25 billion of an open position in
all foreign currencies still current  is that appropriate under current circumstances
ms mosser  it is  however based on a previous vote we have exempted the
fluctuations in the value of foreign portfolios due to changes in the exchange rates  we do
nothing at this point but passively invest both our yen and our euro portfolios  but given the size
of exchange rate movements that we have it would be possible at some point for us
inadvertently to exceed a 25 billion limit  so we are assuming that we fixed an exchange rate at
a time when we were under 25 billion and we determined that if we happen to go over
inadvertently it would not be a good idea then to go into the market and actively buy or sell
foreign exchange to undo that  so other than that exemption yes we are abiding by that and
that is in force right now
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  first of all i applaud the changes in item 5
to the domestic authorization  i will note here that it has been a triennial tradition for the federal
reserve bank of richmond president to dissent on the foreigncurrencyrelated directives  i am
going to break with tradition and support them  our opposition in the past had to do with their
use and the implications in foreign exchange operations that struck us as offbalancesheet fiscal
policy that was more properly done by the treasury
however i would like to share a couple of comments on the guidelines for the conduct
of system operations in federal agency issues  let me just state at the outset that in my view
they conflict with what we are doing now with agencies  credit allocation is a term of art and
i think there is room for reasonable people in good faith to take different positions on what that
means as is the case with terms like normal market functioning as well  i think of the term in
this context by comparing purchasing agency securities with some broaderbased purchase of a
similar quantity  i think we will have an opportunity to discuss this later in agenda item 8 but
that thought experiment leads me to believe that these operations must compared with a broader
based purchase of treasuries lower particular market sectors interest rates relative to others and
leave others higher than they otherwise would be  i recognize that there are membersin fact
the broad majority herewho probably want to continue with the program and not suspend the
guidelines  if i had my choice i would not suspend the guidelines i would suspend the
program  so what i would like to do is respectfully register a negative vote on this  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  certainly  other questions or comments  all right  if we
are ready to vote then why dont we do them separately beginning first with the revision to the
authorization for domestic open market operations  do we have a motion
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  are there any objections  any no votes  everybody
okay  i take that as unanimous  second the revision to the authorization for foreign currency
operations  i need a motion
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any objections  no votes
hearing none  third the proposed treatment of the guidelines for the conduct of system
operations in federal agency issues  given what president lacker said why dont we call the
roll on this one
ms danker
chairman bernanke                yes
vice chairman dudley           yes
governor duke                       yes
president evans                      yes
governor kohn                       yes
president lacker                     no
president lockhart                  yes
governor warsh                     yes
president yellen                     yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  all right  that covers the organizational items
at this point i would like to convene a board meeting joint with the fomc  i need a motion to
close the meeting
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  all right  thank you  so now for the rest of today and
tomorrow we will be in joint session  lets turn now to our regular desk reports starting with
trish and these reports will include not only our regular financial updates but also the broader
discussion of balance sheet issues and so on that we talked about at our videoconference  trish
ms mosser1   thank you mr chairman  spence and i will be referring to the financial conditions and facilities handout in front of you  stress in financial markets has eased somewhat in recent weeks but very unevenly  markets directly supported by the federal reserve or government actions have seen declines in spreads improved liquidity and modest increases in trading and lending activity  but markets beyond the reach of fed and government programs remain very strained  moreover the economic and financial downturn is very rapidly depleting banks capital cushions
let me start with markets in which the fed has intervened  interbank lending spreads shown in exhibit 1 have continued to narrow  the sharpest declines in liborois spreads actually occurred before yearend and at present oneweek and onemonth spreads are below their early september levels  the declines in spreads occurred at the same time that private lending among banks increased modestly particularly at the oneweek and onemonth tenors  but almost no one is willing to take the risk of lending on an unsecured basis to a bank for more than a month  as a result libor spreads three months and beyond remain elevated  as spence will discuss in more detail declining spreads and increased privatesector lending have been reflected in reduced demand for term liquidity at our facilities  similarly in commercial paper markets activity is up and spreads are down  rates on all types of a1rated paper have declinedyou can see this in the second exhibitsince the announcements of the various fed facilities for commercial paper and money market funds  after yearend even a2p2 commercial paper spreads which are not eligible for the cpff fell sharply
in exhibit 3 consumer mortgage rates as well as mortgage and agency spreads have declined notably since the announcement of the fed purchase programs in november  in addition secondary mortgage market spreads to treasuries fell again during the first week of the purchase program in early january  retail conforming mortgage rates have increased somewhat from very low levels in early january moving up with longterm treasury yields but they remain well below the levels that prevailed before the feds purchase program was announced  spence will be talking in more detail about the mbs purchase program in a few minutes
the fdic guarantee of financial debt has had an indirect effect on the corporate bond market  corporate bond spreads pictured in exhibit 4 widened throughout the fall but since december these spreadswhich do not include fdic guaranteed debthave declined  at the same time the nonguaranteed portion of new issuance seen in exhibit 5 has actually increased in just the first two weeks of january it accounted for more than half of new issuance  apparently guaranteed debt is not attractive to traditional corporate bond investors so they have shifted into obligations of nonfinancial issuers  this has effectively increased demand for a small pool of corporate bond issuers causing spreads to decline

1  the materials used by ms mosser and mr hilton are appended to this transcript appendix 1
in contrast markets without fed or government backstopsuch as consumer assetbacked securities commercialmortgagebacked securities and leveraged loanshave shown little or no improvement  consumer abs spreads exhibit 6 have narrowed a bit since the passing of yearend but remain very elevated despite expectations for the beginning of the talf program in late february or early march activity is at a standstill and according to both the packagers and the buyers of securitized products it is likely to remain so until the talf is up and running and market participants have a sense that it will work
cmbs and leveragedloan prices shown in the next exhibit seemed to stabilize late last year but recently have fallen even further as the macroeconomic outlook has continued to worsen more sharply than expected  the outlook for nonagency mortgage securities continues to deteriorate  recently the rating agencies projected even larger losses which will cause formerly aaa super senior tranches to be downgraded to defaultlevel ratings  all of this is of course more bad news for holders of these securitiesincluding banks insurers and the gseswhich are likely to face larger writedowns on marktomarket assets and significantly larger impairment charges  recent headlines about capital impairments at several of the federal home loan banks reflect these ongoing writedowns
despite the modest improvements in some markets one should not underestimate how remarkably fragile financial markets are right now  the process of deleveraging asset sales and overall reduction in the risk profile of large financial institutions continues unabatedalthough in a somewhat more orderly way than a couple of months ago  lack of liquidity is one symptom of this fragility  although liquidity has improved since the beginning of the year for most markets this improvement can be characterized as moving from nonexistent to very poor  even core benchmark markets such as treasuries and foreign exchange have exceptionally strained liquidity  volumes are at multiyear lows  bidasked spreads in eurodollar foreign exchange trading exhibit 8 have more than doubled  in benchmark treasury markets the amount traders will buy or sell at a given pricethe trade quote size shown in exhibit 9is 01 of normal  volatility has remained correspondingly high across nearly all markets even with the improved conditions in the last few weeks
high volatility and poor liquidity can be selfreinforcing  they raise the cost of making and underwriting markets which leads to less trading higher spreads less credit formation and in general a lot less risktaking
the lack of liquidity across markets has led to some obvious unexploited profit opportunities  exhibits 10 and 11 give a couple of examples  exhibit 10 shows the average error between the yield on 10year treasury securities and the predicted yield for those securities based on the boards model  in normal market conditions a host of market participantstrading desks institutional investors and hedge fundstrade constantly each day to exploit such large gaps and arbitrage them away  at present a combination of balance sheet constraints and high volatility has caused a pullback in this activity which again is selfreinforcing  exhibit 11 has a second example of an unexploited profit opportunitynamely the spread between yields on corporate
credit default swaps cds and corporate bonds  even in normal market conditions the corporate cds market is the more liquid because it requires less balance sheet and is a more standardized product but the difference amounts to a few basis points currently the spread between cds and corporate bonds is more than 200 basis points for liquid investmentgrade bonds and nearly 450 basis points for high yield
large losses and associated balance sheet constraints of banks and dealers are major reasons for the drying up of liquidity across markets  but also important is the lack of arbitrageursmost notably hedge funds  hedge fund losses in the last few months have been enormous  as exhibit 12 shows 2008 was the worst year on record for the hedge fund industry with losses of 20 to 40 percent for the group
almost every type of hedge fund had doubledigit losses except short equity and they were shut out of the market for some time  losses were concentrated in the second half of the year with about twothirds of them in the last quarter  the poor performance provoked record redemptions estimated to be at least 150 billion and as much as 400 billion  of course redemptions would have been much larger if manyparticularly largehedge funds had not shut their gates  in response hedge funds have deleveraged very quickly adding more downward pressure to asset prices and further undermining liquidity  in short the capacity of the financial system to absorb and mitigate shocks is smallas small as it has been during this crisis
at present there are two closely linked risks to the fragile equilibrium in markets
one of course is the continued rapid deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook both in the united states and globally  the second is the truly precarious financial condition of many of the largest financial institutions particularly the global banks fourthquarter bank earnings which we are in the midst of receiving were expected to be very bad and in fact have been even worse for the major us banks as exhibit 13 shows  earnings expectations for large european banks are even worse than for us banks  if they disappoint to the same degree the q4 losses just for the
banks in the table could easily be above 70 billion  adding in the hedge fund losses and the large expected losses at the gses and insurance companies q4 losses in the hundreds of billions seem likely
the outlook for banks is hugely uncertain  simply put investors are worried about the size of the hole in banks balance sheetsthat is the size of the additional asset writedowns and reserving that will be necessary  if the hole is large as anticipated or worse enormous how will banks be able to fill it  as exhibit 14 shows banks regulatory capital ratios look fairly robust but for large banks the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assetsa metric that investors and rating agencies follow closelylooks much more precarious  most important losses come first out of common equity  replacing those losses at current share prices implies potentially massive dilution for current shareholders  as a result bank equity prices remain under severe pressureas can be seen in exhibits 15 16 and 17  to scale just how far bank equity prices have fallen the market cap of all us banks including investment banks is now about the same as the market cap of the soft drink industry
the downward pressure on us and european bank stocks is reinforced by uncertainty about the form and size of government intervention particularly for the weakest players which are viewed as closer to insolvency or government assistance even if some investors view banks as having significant longterm value the possibility of government dilution or even nationalization discourages capital injections from the private sector  in contrast government support of banks has capped their credit spreads which you can see in exhibits 18 19 and 20  although credit tiering is evident in cds spreads the level of bank cds for both us and foreign banks has remained in the high end of the investmentgrade range  equity holders may expect to be wiped out but debt holders clearly view the probability of losses as fairly low
market expectations that largescale fiscal action will need to be taken in support of the economy and the financial system have had a significant effect on sovereign credit default swap spreads  the cds spreads in exhibit 21 have risen because the expected fiscal cost has soared and because of uncertainty about the ultimate size of the billwhich will depend critically on global economic growth and on the magnitude of government assistance to financial institutions  not surprisingly cds spreads for small countries with relatively large financial services sectorsuch as the united kingdom spain and irelandhave increased proportionally the most  in recent weeks movements in sovereign cds spreads have mirrored movements in the countries bank cds spreads
accompanying the increase in sovereign cds spreads has been a pronounced steepening of yield curves in the major economies  exhibit 22 shows that in recent weeks treasury yields in the united states are up at all maturities but the increases in longerterm yields are particularly largethe 30year is up about 40 basis points in the last week and a half or so  part of this increase is likely due to shortrun supply increases  in the next few weeks 150 billion of new treasury coupon securities will be auctioned and this week alone we are auctioning 200 billion of treasury bills notes and bonds  given illiquid market conditions we shouldnt be surprised to see a rise in yields that is somewhat exaggerated  nonetheless with large and sustained fiscal deficits on the horizon somewhat higher borrowing rates are not too surprising
finally a few words about monetary policy expectations  the results of the desks latest dealer survey are shown in exhibit 23  neither the dealers nor the futures markets expect any change in the target fed funds range in the near term dealer economists expect the current fed funds target range to be maintained well into 2010 reflecting widespread views that the combination of a deep recession and continued financial crisis will require easy monetary conditions for some time to come  spence will now discuss the balance sheet and the use of facilities
mr hilton  thank you trish  assets on the federal reserves balance sheet as of last friday totaled 204 trillion as shown in exhibit 24  the total has declined about 250 billion from its recent peak on december 17 with most of that decline
coming since the yearend  i should note that most of the data in these charts are as of last friday and just within the last day there have been some fairly significant developments at some of the facilities  for example at the cpff borrowing came down as much as 50 billion yesterday and another 21 billion just today and were learning today about large declines in swap facilities that will take effect on this thursday  but before i get into some discussion of the individual facilities let me give the general picture of what weve been seeing
in general demand at several of the special liquidity facilities has fallen to one degree or another in recent weeks reflecting a relaxation of stressful conditions in some of the money markets as suggested by the downward movement in money market yields which is shown in exhibit 25  some of the key term funding rates that are linked to several of our liquidity facilities are shown here  the direct support offered by various federal reserve programs which since october have provided a large amount of term funding to banks dealers and other financial institutionsas well as the support offered by various government initiativeshas been behind much of the easing of conditions in these funding markets and also helps explain why the yearend passed fairly uneventfully  lower rates in these financing markets in turn affect the economic incentives to use some of the facilities and that is being reflected in the more recent experience  but other factors such as an ongoing deleveraging of positions have also contributed to falling usage in some cases
looking ahead we anticipate that the net size of the balance sheet is likely to continue to fall for a time but by how much is difficult to say  even if reported market rates remain at levels that suggest cheaper funding could now be secured in the market the liquidity behind those quotes is not always deep  any net decline that we see in coming weeks will also likely prove to be temporary  the agency mortgagebacked security and agency debt purchase programs are really just getting
under way and the talf program starts only later this winter  moreover as we have already experienced the usage of many of these facilities could change quickly and substantially should conditions in financial markets again deteriorate
now ill tell about some of the recent experiences at individual facilities in more detail  the term securities lending facility tslf which is illustrated in exhibits 26 and 27 does not affect the size of our balance sheet but does alter the composition of assets that must be financed in the marketplace  tslf loans outstanding are just around 125 billion and thats off a level of about 200 billion in postseptember
the auctions continue to be undersubscribed and stopout rates have regularly been at the minimum bid rates  even over the yearend only a small quantity of the options on loans sold under the tslf options program were exercised  the downward trend in participation here is consistent with the narrowing in spreads between the term repo rates on the collateral that we accept and those on the treasury securities that we lend  in rough order of magnitude these spreads are now in line with the minimum bid rates at both the schedule 1 and the schedule 2 tslf auctions dealers have also indicated that their holdings of some private securities that are eligible under schedule 2 continue to shrink and that money market funds and other
investors are now more willing to finance the agency debt and agency mbs that we accept on schedule 1  on that last observation ill note that today we let our last outstanding 28day singletranche repo mature bringing to closure the initiative begun last march under which we arranged term repos against agency mortgage backed securities as collateral  as recently as one month ago the outstanding value of these operations was still at its peak of 80 billion
net draws by foreign central banks under our swap agreements have come off a peak of 586 billion in early december and as of last friday they stand 120 billion below that as shown in exhibit 28  declines in libor and foreign exchange swap funding costs seem to be having a direct effect on participation levels  most of the dollars made available by the participating foreign central banks are allocated at a rate of ois plus 100 basis points across oneweek onemonth and threemonth tenors
recently ois rates out to three months have been standing at about 20 basis points there have been considerable reductions in draws at the shorter maturities where libor rates are now well below these allocation rates  some of the decline in the shorter maturities has been offset by increases in draws at the threemonth maturity where threemonth libor rates are now very close to the ois plus 100 basis point threshold  but just this morning we learned of an 80 billion decline in net draws on some of the 84day allotments about 50 billion at the ecb
term auction facility loans outstanding have come off their peak level of
450 billion reached over the yearend and now total 416 billion exhibit 29  most of this decline reflects the runoff of some of the special forwardsettling operations arranged last november that spanned the yearend  although propositions have been below the offered amounts since last october when the auction sizes were raised to
150 billion the quantities borrowed remain large as seen at the last several auctions including yesterdays 84day operation exhibit 30  improvement in the term interbank market has not so far translated into a significant decrease in participation at our taf auctions  that may reflect the fact that the minimum bid rate is set equal to the interest rate paid on excess reserves which is just 25 basis points and that most banks have ample collateral available to secure such loans
in line with the more general trends borrowing at the pcf and the pdcf has been falling as well as indicated in exhibit 31  pcf borrowing has been running around 60 billion and pdcf borrowing has been about 30 billion
the commercial paper funding facility passed a major milestone yesterdayits threemonth anniversary  as shown in exhibit 32 much of the 350 billion of commercial paper purchased through last friday under the program was acquired in the first days of operations beginning on october 27  since then increases have continued at a steady but much slower pace  the cpff purchases only 90day paper and reflecting the heavy concentration of purchases at the outset exactly three months ago 88 billion matured yesterday  of yesterdays maturing paper only 33 billion was replaced with new issuance at the cpff the remaining 55 billion of the maturing total was not  today another 57 billion was maturing of which about
20 billion to 25 billion rolled off  this is pretty much what we would expect and what several of the participants in the program had indicated that they would likely do given that cp rates in the market are now well below the cpff loan rates  these rates are set at ois plus 200 basis points for unsecured paper 100 basis points less for paper with a guarantee and ois plus 300 basis points for assetbacked cp issuers that did not roll over their maturing cp at the cpff covered themselves in one of several ways  some had prefunded themselves in the cp market were funding themselves elsewhere or had reduced their overall funding need  shortterm funding markets were able to absorb the increased issuance with no apparent problem yesterday although some backup in cp rates has been seen in recent days and a large amount of cp issued to the cpff about another 130 billion matures over the coming week or so
the use of two facilities targeted at money market funds reflects the continuing improvement in the position of these funds  amlf abcp money market mutual fund liquidity facility loans continue to run off and are now just about 15 billion exhibit 33  still there has been no borrowing at the mmiff money market investor funding facility  inflows into prime money market funds and funds that invest in agency paper remain on a steady uptrend exhibit 34
there have been however some areas of growth in the assets on the balance sheet  purchases of agency mbs being made through our four investment managers have continued at a fairly steady daily pace since these operations commenced on january 5 exhibit 35  cumulative commitments total 58 billion through january 23  this puts us on a pace to accumulate as much as 500 billion by the end of the second quarter  few of the purchases arranged so far have actually settledso far about 7 billion  this reflects the considerable delays between purchase and settlement that characterize this market  of the contracted purchases so far the vast majority have been for mbs for 30year maturities most with coupons ranging from
45 percent to 55 percent  the optionadjusted spread to treasury rates narrowed almost 50 basis points after the announcement of the program in november  on balance spreads have tightened somewhat further since purchases began in early january but there have also been periods of modest backup amid strong selling pressure  some of the selling pressure reportedly reflects a lack of clarity among market participants about the feds commitment to this market after the second quarter and the 500 billion purchase objective has been met  investors are worried that there may be a cliff with purchases ending abruptly at the end of the second quarter  this uncertainty could be lessened if for example the committee stated that the program will continue beyond midyear as market conditions warrant
conforming mortgage rates had been about 6 percent just before the program announcement  shortly after we began our purchases they were being posted by the same banks at rates as low as just under 5 percent but they have more recently moved back up closer to 55 percent as originators struggle to process the wave of refinancings that has ensued
working with the investment managers we have been confronting the challenges of both building up a large portfolio of agency mbs and trying to be supportive of smooth market function  this has provided some perspective about the potential value of our being sellers at times or of participating in the dollarroll market even as part of a strategy oriented toward building and maintaining a large portfolio
likewise the rise in mortgage applications shown in exhibit 36 indicates that the supply of new agency mbs may increase sharply in coming months which may be a factor that we need to consider in determining the appropriate pace for mbs purchases going forward
meanwhile we have continued to purchase agency coupon securities arranging about one operation per week  since purchases began in early december we have bought a total of 23 billion exhibit 37  so far at least most of the narrowing in spreads of agency debt to treasury securities realized since this initiative was announced in late november has been maintained  the purchases reportedly have contributed to the markets receptive response to the renewal of debt issuance by the agencies this month
trish noted the relative lack of improvement in those markets not directly targeted by any of the federal reserves newer liquidity facilities  with that as background let me provide a brief update on the term assetbacked securities loan facility talf just as a quick reminder through the talf the federal reserve bank of new york will lend as much as 200 billion on a nonrecourse basis for up to three years against certain aaarated consumer abs as collateral  the us treasury department will provide 20 billion of credit protection to the new york fed in connection with the talf and further protection will be provided by haircuts on the loans  in recent weeks staff members at the new york fed the board and the treasury have made significant progress in finalizing several aspects of the program that are critical to its success  these include working out a host of operational details  the aim is to post the terms and conditions for the facility and to provide frequently asked questions by the end of this week with the goal of being operational maybe even as soon as late february or early march
ill conclude my review of the financial assets on the balance sheet by noting that we last ran off a small portion of our remaining bill holdings last september and have arranged no outright operations in treasury securities since then  we now hold around 475 billion  we have no conventional repo agreements outstanding and have not arranged any such operations in the market since october  on the liability side of the balance sheet the offset to net swings in total assets has mostly been in excess reserves which are now in the neighborhood of 800 billionmaybe now closer to
700 billion  the treasury had built up its balances held at the fed under its supplementary financing program to a level of 560 billion in november  since then it has been running down these balances because of debt ceiling considerations and they now total 175 billion  brian will now continue our presentation
mr madigan   thank you  the staff is recommending that the board and the fomc act to extend the various liquidity facilities that are scheduled to expire on april 30  the pdcf the tslf the amlf the cpff the mmiff and the temporary reciprocal foreigncurrency arrangements are all currently scheduled to expire at the end of april  as trish noted conditions in some financial markets have improved somewhat in recent months but those improvements have been limited
with the macroeconomic situation and the condition of financial institutions both deteriorating significantly the recent improvements would seem to be attributable not to any strengthening of the fundamentals but rather to the range of actions taken by the federal reserve the treasury the fdic the congress and foreign central banks and governments to stabilize the financial system as well as to the passage of year end  as spence has noted even though the usage of some facilities has declined amounts outstanding under some programs such as the cpff remain substantial
moreover the level of usage is by no means an adequate metric for assessing the contributions of these programs to stabilizing markets  in many cases market participants continue to look to the facilities as important backstops for their funding in these circumstances it would seem premature to consider terminating any of the existing liquidity facilities at this time
although the facilities do not expire for three months the staff believes that the board and the fomc should act now to extend them  absent an action to extend the programs market participants and analysts are likely to speculate increasingly about the federal reserves intentions for the facilities which probably would add unhelpfully to market jitters  also lenders may increasingly become concerned that borrowers will not have access to backup funding facilities to repay currently extended loans when those credits mature in a few weeks and hence could become more chary about lending now
the staff recommends that the board and the fomc extend the expiring facilities through october 30  this sixmonth extension from april 30 should be sufficient for now to assure market participants that the lending programs will be available for the period of time relevant for money market transactions  a case could be made for an even longer extension to take the programs over yearendsay through january 30 2010but you may be concerned that such a very long extension could signal a view that the financial crisis will be quite protracted  also for the programs that depend on the boards section 133 authority the requirement to find that unusual and exigent circumstances are present may be interpreted as making it difficult to extend these programs for a full year from now  if you do extend the facilities through october as recommended you may wish to plan informally on revisiting the expiration dates of these programs around the time of your june or august meeting so that you will be able to provide advance notice to market participants about whether or not the programs will be extended beyond october
some of the federal reserves special programsfor example the tafdo not have a set expiration date and hence do not need to be extended  also the talf is not set to expire until yearend  thus under the staff proposal to extend the other
expiring facilities through october 30 the talf would not need to be extended at this time
if the board and the fomc act at this meeting to extend the programs the staff anticipates that the extensions would be announced to the public on thursday at 1000 am  because the swap lines are among the items proposed for extension part of the press release would be joint with our foreign central bank counterparties  draft resolutions for consideration by the board and the fomc were included in the staff memo on this matter  trish will now continue our presentation
ms mosser  thank you  i am going to discuss longterm treasury purchases by the soma for a few minutes  last week we circulated a memo outlining four options with respect to the longterm treasury purchase program  to summarize option 1 is to retain purchases as an option but not to implement at this time option 2 is to implement a pilot program option 3 is to implement a largescale purchase program and option 4 is to purchase illiquid longterm treasuries not with the explicit goal of bringing down longerterm yields but to improve treasury market functioning  in addition of course there was an implicit option of announcing that a longterm treasury purchase program was completely off the table  the staff recommended option 1retain the program as an option that continues to be evaluated but dont implement at the current time
the staff demurred from implementing such a program at this time for five reasons  first for the further expansion of the federal reserves balance sheet that would be needed this program was viewed as likely to be less effective dollar for dollar in easing financial conditions than programs more directly linked to credit formation and to markets with more impaired liquidity  second it was unclear how big such a program would need to be to push down yields significantly from their current quite low levels  a large program might not do much at these levels  in that case the program would be an especially inefficient use of balance sheet capacity
third such a program could potentially distort the relationship between treasury and privatesector yields affecting treasury yields while having little effect on private rates  this could potentially undermine the value of treasuries as a hedging vehicle fourth such a program might even have adverse effects  in particular some commentators would almost certainly argue that such purchases amounted simply to monetizing the federal deficit  although it is difficult to assess what effect such arguments would have on financial markets worries on this score could conceivably lead to higher risk premiums which could undermine the programs effectiveness
fifth the program would increase the interest rate risk inherent in the federal reserves balance sheet because the longterm treasuries would be funded by excess reservesan overnight obligation  this means that if shortterm rates rose in the future the feds net interest margin could be squeezed potentially generating losses for taxpayers
the staff does recommend however keeping the program alive as an option
after all some of the decline in treasury yields since early december may be due to
expectations of such a program in the future  if the committee endorses the staffs recommendation to retain it as an option but not implement it at this time will long term treasury yields rise significantlysay more than 10 or 20 basis points  that does not seem likely  first most market participants even those that believe the fomc will purchase longterm treasuries eventually do not anticipate that the federal reserve will necessarily begin purchases right away  they generally believe that with treasury yields as low as they are currently there is no need to commence such a purchase program immediately  second market participants are placing a probability of only about 50 percent that such a program will be implemented at all thats based on our latest primary dealer survey  if the program is kept on the shelf and remains a part of the tool kit and that is clearly communicated to the market via the fomc statement we would anticipate that this would generate at most only a modest backup in treasury yields  finally the note distributed last week also contained some observations about some of the other options for moving ahead with purchases at this point and discussed some of the execution issues raised by the purchase program  ill now turn to nathan who will continue our presentation
mr sheets  thank you  given ongoing stresses in the global financial system and the vulnerability of some key us institutions to foreigncurrency funding pressures the staff has begun to assess the pros and cons of establishing temporary liquidity swap lines that would allow the federal reserve to lend euro yen sterling and swiss francs to us institutions  these lines would be the mirror image of our existing swap lines and would allow the federal reserve to respond to eventualities ranging from a foreigncurrency liquidity squeeze faced by a single us bank all the way to a systemic shortage of foreigncurrency funding among us institutions  we raise this issue in todays meeting in the spirit of bringing to your attention an issue that we see emerging on the horizon  that said we are still sorting through and evaluating a number of considerations that bear on this initiative and we would very much appreciate your thoughts and guidance
one major money center bank has recently shown particular vulnerability to foreigncurrency funding pressure  this institutions huge presence in foreign markets is reliant on secured and unsecured foreigncurrency funding  the vulnerability of its foreign deposit base and limited foreigncurrency collateral has been apparent on a number of occasions over the past several months  indeed just last monday when us markets were closed our bank supervisors had significant concerns regarding the institutions ability to access sufficient foreigncurrency funding  there were similar worries during a particularly stressful period in november  in each instance the necessary financing was obtained but the situation nevertheless remains fragile  while this one institution is a focus of concern at present we cannot rule out scenarios in which other large us institutions also run into trouble meeting their foreigncurrency funding needs  there is a related risk that once one us institution showed pronounced vulnerability in this regard other us institutions might also then be viewed as vulnerable and that a broader foreign currency liquidity crunch could develop
these observations suggest that it would be prudent for the federal reserve to have the capacity to backstop the foreigncurrency funding needs of us institutions establishing temporary swap lines with foreign central banks strikes us as a straightforward way to achieve this objective  such swap lines would ensure that the federal reserve could serve as a lender of last resort in foreign currencies for us institutions  in particular these lines would offer a reliable vehicle for providing foreigncurrency funding to us banks during times when us markets were closed because of either time zone differences or us holidays  our expectation is that these new swap lines would be signed and implemented only if funding conditions clearly warranted  we do not recommend putting them in place on a precautionary basis largely because we are not certain how the markets would receive the announcement of such facilities  rather the features of these lines could be negotiated with our central bank counterparties with the draft agreements then put on the shelf to be approved and executed as needed
to ensure that these lines could be rapidly implemented in deteriorating conditions we recommend that the fomc consider delegating authority to the foreign currency subcommittee to conclude such arrangements  there might still be some announcement effect created by the reporting of such a vote in the fomc minutes but it would probably not be seen as signaling the same urgency as an announcement that the facilities themselves had been established  the authority granted to the subcommittee in this regard would be symmetric to that already delegated to the subcommittee to negotiate swap arrangements to allow major foreign central banks to lend dollars
three further issues are worth mentioning briefly  first the legal structure of our existing swap lines requires the federal reserve to deposit the foreign currency it receives as part of the swap in an account at the foreign central bank  these new swap lines would be symmetric to our existing lines but they would allow the federal reserve to lend the foreign currency to us financial institutions and require foreign central banks to deposit the dollars they receive at the federal reserve  in principle our existing swap arrangements could be amended to allow us to lend foreign currency  but we would prefer implementing these new swap lines through a separate and parallel set of agreements in order to reduce similarities to the oldstyle swap lines that were used to fund foreign exchange intervention in previous decades second there are other means that could in principle be used to get foreigncurrency funding to us institutions under stress  one alternative would be striking agreements with foreign central banks for them to lend against highquality dollar collateral  but central banks have been working on these procedures for some time and although progress has been made not enough of these arrangements are in place to address the existing vulnerabilities  in addition foreign central banks may be hesitant to lend to a troubled us institution during a period of stress particularly on the basis of collateral held outside their jurisdictions  as another approach we could simply require us institutions to sell their dollar collateral and obtain foreign currency themselves in the foreign exchange spot or forward market  however this might be difficult or disruptive during periods of market stress and would leave
institutions vulnerable during times when foreign markets are open and us markets are closed  third the provision of foreigncurrency denominated liquidity to the foreign branch of a us depository institution would rely on the discount window authority of the reserve banks and some technical issues would need to be worked through in implementing a lending arrangement along these lines
the staff is not proposing that you vote today to establish these new swap arrangements but we are highlighting this as an issue meriting your attention  we also note that if stresses in foreigncurrency funding conditions persist we may be back to youperhaps very soon and perhaps even in the middle of the night laughter with a request to move forward with these arrangements and the corresponding delegation to the subcommittee  thank you  that concludes our presentation and we are very happy to take your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  that was very informative and a lot to digest as
well  let me just remind the committee that the only action item in the list other than the
ratification of domestic open market operations is the proposal to extend the programs  the
discussions of treasury purchases and foreigncurrency swaps are just for information at this
point  we will have an opportunity in a few minutes to have a discussion on these issues but
before we do that let me first see if there are any questions for our colleagues  any questions
for trish or her colleagues  president rosengren
mr rosengren  so the talf is scheduled to end in january but all the other
programs with this vote will be scheduled to end in october is that right
mr madigan  the talfdecember 31
mr rosengren  yearend
mr madigan  yes and for the other ones that have a maturity date the extension
would be through october 30
mr rosengren  it seems a little peculiar to have different dates  it seems
particularly peculiar to have it end at the end of the year when that is likely to be a problematic
time regardless of whether things settle down  so actually i would have a preference to go to
january  but if we are not going to go to january i do think that we should discuss it at the june
meeting not the august meeting because i know that there has been some uncertainty in the
markets about which programs would be extended  i dont think the speculation has been
particularly healthy so it is better to have a little more clarity  it might be worthwhile if we are
going to have it end in october actually to include that it would be discussed in june so that
people know that it will come up again
chairman bernanke  there is a tradeoff between giving people the assurance of a
long period and flexibilitynot committing our balance sheet for an extended period  but i
agree with you that if we do this we ought to revisit it earlier rather than close to the date
mr rosengren  yes  the august meeting seems a little late given that there is
likely to be speculation about yearend by august
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  is it too early to ask for a few more details on
the swap description that you were talking about  in the following sensethere was nothing
distributed on this right
mr sheets  correct
mr evans  okay  because the question that i asked before about the swapsand i
had been comforted by the answeris what our loss exposure is when we provide swaps to
foreign central banks  they stand behind them so that is about as good as we have  this is
sounding a little different  if i understood what you were talking about it is that we will be
using them as an agent to provide funding to our troubled institutions and some discussion about
what guarantees and whatnot would be very helpful
mr sheets  the risk profile would be different for exactly the reason you suggest  a
lot of the analysis on this particular proposal has been done just over the past few days and that
is one reason that we are not presenting it with a fuller description and more detail  but we
certainly intend to continue to do that work and as we make progress on some of these issues
we certainly plan to circulate a memo to the committee describing some of the other issues
mr evans  is it too early to have some idea what the order of magnitude of the
funding requirements might look like
mr sheets  we havent thought systematically about that issue  i mean i could
guess
mr evans  i wouldnt hold you to it if you are willing to
mr sheets  but i think it would probably be better not to guess  maybe trish wants
to guess  laughter
mr evans  i have noticed that the astute responders dont go for that line  laughter
ms mosser  potentially fairly largeparticularly if we are considering more than one
large institution  in the scenario that nathan laid out which is the risk that we are considering
we think it is somewhat less likely that we would use these lines for the sort of operations that
most of our foreign central bank counterparties are using to distribute dollars which are
operations and tenders that are open to all  we dont see that kind of need across a broad group
of institutions and a broad group of banks around the united states  but there is certainly a
subset of institutions many of them quite large with very sizable foreign exchange funding that
fund themselves in asia europe and south america  should those institutions end up being in
worse financial shape many of them actually have quite substantial collateral with us at the
discount windows in the various districts  but they would not need funding in dollars  they
would want to come to us instead and for example take out a discount loanthey could do it
through other mechanismsin a foreign currency rather than in dollars  the way that we would
then finance itgiven the relatively modest size of our foreign exchange reserves and the fact
that the reserves are only in two currencieswould be to establish swap lines and fund them that
way
mr evans  okay  thank you  that is very helpful
chairman bernanke  vice chairman did you have an intervention
vice chairman dudley  yes just a very brief one to reinforce nathans point
we began discussions with the foreign central banks literally last week on this issue and it was
really begun because of the vulnerability that we felt on martin luther kings birthday with our
being closed and what would happen in that environmenthow we could get liquidity to a us
bank that might have difficulties abroad  in terms of president evanss questions about risk this
is really no different from our lending domestically to a domestic institution against collateral
that we hold except that we are basically using that collateral to fund the foreign exchange swap
so you can just think of it as equivalent to our lending to a domestic institution against the
collateral they hold here in the united states
chairman bernanke  president lacker do you have an intervention
mr lacker  you may have mentioned this but who bears the foreign exchange risk
in this
mr sheets  maybe vice chairman dudley and trish have some thoughts on this
ms mosser  the way that we structure the foreign exchange swaps now is at a fixed
exchange rate for both the front and the back leg so that we dont have
mr lacker  right  so the other central bank bears it  so in this case who would
bear it
ms mosser  we would basically get back the dollars that we gave to them
mr lacker  so we would bear the foreign exchange risk of the swap
vice chairman dudley  details have not been addressed
mr sheets  there is a new dimension to think throughthat is who is bearing the
foreign exchange risk visvis our central bank counterparty  and i dont think the terms there
are going to be different  but then when we go on to lend that foreign exchange to our
commercial bank there is a new dimension in thinking about foreign exchange risk
mr lockhart  that is a credit risk  that is not a foreign exchange risk
mr sheets  well it depends on which currency it is being booked in
mr lacker  wait wait wait  when you say it would be the same it depends on
whose point of view it is  the way trish described it we would bear the foreign exchange risk
visvis the other central banks  is that what you are saying
mr sheets  we are still thinking through that point
ms mosser  that is the part that is still being worked out  i am sorryi
misunderstood your question  we would bear for example through the discount window the
risk of lending in yen and euro  obviously the collateral would be in dollars and the foreign
exchange risk would be
mr lacker  obviously it is a lending risk  but before you do the loan you swap
with the foreign central bank  the way we do it now the foreign central bank bears the currency
risk and in this one we would
mr sheets  thats right  the way that works is when we do that swap we agree to
unwind that swap at the exchange rate that prevailed at the time the swap was made  my
preference in these negotiations is that for these other swaps we would do exactly the same
thing visvis our foreign central bank counterparties
mr lacker to make them bear it
mr sheets  so they would still be bearing the foreign exchange risk  but in some
sense we are promising that we get back the dollars we put in and they get back the foreign
currency they put in  right
vice chairman dudley  it is risk in that the currency is going to be worth less in
dollars but it is not risk in that you are getting back anything different than what you actually
extended
mr sheets  yes that is right  in some sense the federal reserve and they dont
really care because they get back their currency and we get back our currency
chairman bernanke  theres an element of hedging here  president fisher
mr fisher  well actually president evans asked one of the questions that i was
going to ask  mine is a lot more generic of trish  to what degree do you sense that this credit
default swap market is helping or hindering efficient markets and the equilibration of these
distortions that we are seeing  because there is some debate about this  i am talking about the
speculative cds positions
ms mosser  my view is that the credit default swap market has taken a lot of abuse
for many things that would have happened even if it didnt exist
mr fisher  so is it exacerbating
ms mosser  there have been a few times certainly that the peculiarities of the
structure of the cds market have led to morevolatile changes in spreads from one day to the
next  but quite honestly it is a more liquid market  it probably gives you a truer price signal
for the vast majority of credits out there particularly large corporations both financial and
nonfinancial than the corporate bond market does  when market liquidity goes away and it is
harder to discern fundamental movements in asset prices the less liquid marketand that is
definitely corporate bondsgives you the worst signal and the cds market probably gives you
a better signal  given the size of the cds market the rapidity with which it grew the size to
which it grew and the fact that it is a little the dog that didnt bark and that there were certainly
problems with the lehman bankruptcy and a lot of technical issues my view is that frankly it
has been one of the markets that has continued to functionnot wonderfully but it still
functionsand some liquidity is still there  others may have a slightly different view but that
has been our experience
mr fisher  that actually is the basis of my question  the point is whether we are
getting good information from the cds spreads not a distorted version
ms mosser  i think they are probably less distortedcertainly in the case of
corporates
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  first since we are beginning the year a
broad appeal to speak to the furthest person in the room rather than to the person next to you
laughter  it is very hard to follow many of these answers because i cant hear you down at this
end of the table and i can imagine our colleagues here in the back of the room have no idea what
is being discussed
a couple of questions  it is probably a little premature to be thinking in this detail but
the institution that nathan described i think we can all guess because of their foreign operations
they have funding needs in many many currencies  charlie can you hear me at the end of the
table  laughter
mr evans  i can i was just trying to guess whom you were talking about
mr lockhart  would we be using hard currency swap facilities to deal with softer
currency funding problems when the crisis could begin in a minor currency  is there that kind of
linkage conceivably in how we structure and address this  that is the first question  the second
question is if this is an institution for which we have already had an intervention with a
significant and very public amount of money involved would we be offsetting this against that
intervention facility or is this incremental
mr sheets  on the first question you are absolutely correct that this particular
institution does have significant foreigncurrency funding needs in some of the minor asian
currencies for example and has experienced stresses in those  i think that is an issue that we
would need to ponder as to how to proceed on and it was in the back of my mind in the sense
that in our presentation we emphasized euro yen sterling and swiss francs  suppose it is a
minor asian currency  would we want to think about swap lines with some minor central bank
to allow them to have that currency or is getting them yen enough  given market differences
time zones and everything else is getting them yen going to be sufficient to be able to provide
the funding in some of the other asian currencies  those are issues that we are going to have to
spend a fair amount of time thinking hard about  i think maybe the second question is more for
new york
ms mosser  i dont think we are nearly far enough along in this process nor have we
spoken in sufficient detail to either our bank supervisory or our discount window colleagues to
make that judgment frankly  at this point the fact that i know is that quite a significant amount
of collateral is posted within the federal reserve system at the discount window that is not
currently being borrowed against  that is honestly probably as much as we can say at this
stage  but clearly that would be a set of conversations we would have to have
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not we can go to a committee
discussion  we are going to have two more gorounds in which everybody gets to state their
views so i was hoping that instead of a goround we could have a more interactive unstructured
discussion of the issues that have been raised by the presentations  if you allow me i would like
to start by just posting you on a few items and making a few comments and then we will open
the floor for discussion
i think it is important to understand that the calls on our balance sheet and our programs
will be very much conditioned by the decisions being made in the administration and the
congress about the kinds of support they are intending to provide and the approach they are
going to take  as you know tim geithner who was sworn in just yesterday is overseeing the
work with the remainder of the tarp and perhaps an expansion of the tarp depending on
how things go  staff members at the board and the federal reserve banks have been working
very extensively on programs with our fellow bank regulators and have provided a great deal of
support and information to the treasury as they have been trying to think about how to go about
stabilizing the banking system
it seems clear at this point that any solution they are going to come up with is going to
have at least two components  one would be the removal of bad assets in some way from the
balance sheets of the banks  for that purpose there has been discussion as you know of an
aggregator bank ringfencing or some kind of insurance program that would allow banks to
purchase insurance against tail risk for their assets  the second component that is almost certain
to be involved would be capital  but there are a lot of open issues  what is the appropriate
instrument what control rights would be associated with it should the capital be put in just in
time or should it be put in preemptively to make sure that there is coverage for subsequent losses
and what would be the ultimate cost  in particular will the remaining monies in the tarp be
sufficient  i think the smart money is betting no  in addition the treasury is working on the
foreclosure programs which will probably involve up to 50 billion to 100 billion of the tarp
and is looking to support credit markets  i assume that the talf would be part of that program
i have had a few very preliminary discussions with tim geithner about the consequences
for these programs for the federal reserve and tried to talk about our priorities and our
concerns  i think it is a bit strong to say that i am looking for a new fedtreasury accord here
but maybe not that strong  this is a good opportunity the next couple of months as planning is
done and as the administration goes to the congress and makes requests to try to clarify as
much as possible what role the fed is expected to play  in particular i think we should be as
allergic as possible to a longterm commitments of our balance sheet because of the difficulty
of unwinding and b credit risk  those are the two things that concern us  for example if we
do an aggregator bank it would be important to make sure that it is financed not by longterm
federal reserve liquidity but by as one option private financing guaranteed by the fdic
although i think the fed should be open to doing shortterm collateralized lending as it would
for any bank as part of that process  likewise if ringfencing becomes part of the plan i would
defend our actions with respect to two large banks where we have taken tail risk positions as
being necessary for financial stability  but going forward i hope that we will find solutions that
dont involve that kind of glitchy approach
i think that the top priority is to try to get the bank resolution program done in a way that
is consistent with good practices on our part  i have a couple of other requests for tim and i
should just emphasize this is very very preliminary  i have no commitments  ideally one
would be that if the government at some point does develop a resolution trust company or an
aggregator bank they should consider for example taking off our balance sheet some of the
assets that we have acquired at our maiden lane facilities  second an important issue for us
would be the management of the exit strategy  the treasury has already requested from us some
memorandums on the supplementary financing bills and on the fed bills idea and i believe that
they will give serious consideration as to how they can assist us in the exit
the lowest priority for me at this point would be the talflike approach for two
reasons at least  one is that it is an effective approach that will not happen unless the fed is
involved because of the tarp scoring methodthe fact that the tarp is scored in terms of the
full amount that is lent or purchased rather than in terms of some measure of credit risk
therefore it is extremely unlikely that the congress would give any kind of authorization that
would allow for the talf to continue absent some kind of fed cooperation  i would also argue
that the talf is much closer to conventional central bank activity than some of the other things
that we are concerned aboutie it is given the capital support from the treasury it is protected
from credit risk and it is mostly shortterm lending  for those reasons i would put that as
lowest priority  obviously i think that as much as possible we need to cooperate and work
with the treasury to try to get the banking system and the economy stabilized  but this is an
opportunity and i will do what i can to try to get assurances from the treasury about how things
will evolve in the future
in my view the main constraint will be certainly not the goodwill of the treasury or of
the administration but rather the constraints that they face in dealing with the congress  as you
know the tarp and the bank stabilization programs are extremely unpopular  it is going to
take a certain amount of political capital to get additional resources  therefore they are going to
have to dole out their political capital in a quite sparing way  but i will continue to work on
these issues and i understand that they are important to the committee
i support the extension of the programs to october  we did discuss going over yearend
the tradeoff is the commitment to a longer outstanding funding but i do think that we ought to
revisit that in a timely way  on treasury purchases i would like to reiterate what trish said  i
think that there is good reason to keep this on the table that it is not really a good idea to throw
away this option at this point but that it is probably not an efficient way to use those balance
sheet capacities at this juncture  so i would agree with the recommendation of the staff on that
and i think part of our discussion certainly tomorrow in the policy round would be exactly how
to express that in our statement language
just a couple of other comments  first one of the issues which you can see in the press
commentarymurky new territory unknown uncharted waters et cetera et ceterais that
clearly for us to be successful with our current set of policies it is important for us to be as open
and transparent as possible and to provide as much information as possible  i want you to know
that we have here at the board in cooperation with the reserve banks a new transparency
initiative which has at least two parts maybe three  one is that governor kohn has consented to
head a committee that is going to review all of the information associated with our balance sheet
the programs collateral and all of those things and ask the question for information that we do
not release whether we have a good strong policy justification for not releasing it  if not then
we should be as forthcoming as possible about providing the public with information about the
collateral about the programs and so on  so that is ongoing  i will have a hearing on february
10 when i will discuss these issues in front of barney franks committee and i have a speech at
the national press club the week after that when i will address the press and let them ask
questions about these issues
the other part of the transparency initiative is to try to make our programs more
accessible to the general public including the media congressional staffers and the like  we
have an effort under way to develop a website essentially that will link to all of the information
that we have and that will provide overall discussion and education about our various programs
which we hope to get going within a month at the latest  i think the educational aspect of this is
very important in trying to get people more comfortable with the regime that we are operating in
given the constraint on the federal funds rate
finally going along with our discussion about extending the various facilities i should
tell you that using the authority vested in me i extended the tafthe auction facilityuntil
the end of the quarter at the current level of 150 billion  so that particular item goes to the end
of march  but that is an authority as i understand it that we can use here at the board  okay  i
have taken a good bit of time  let me stop and turn to president lacker for comment or
discussion on the issues of the balance sheet
mr lacker  thank you  im happy to kick off our first goround in this format
obviously we established a new interest rate regime at the last meeting and have some knotty
issuesa lot of challengesahead of us  i want to borrow a bit of time from my remarks later
in the meeting and use them here if i could  i respect your appeal for disorganized interaction
but i have organized my thoughts  laughter  i am happy to give a disorganized version if you
would like but
participant  how do we tell  laughter
mr lacker  good question  there is an observational equivalence here i am sure
first let me applaud the discussions you have initiated with the treasury  i want to comment a
bit on that  i think they are very important right now  what i would like to talk a bit about first
is just the two schools of thought that we have been contending with here about how to use our
toolshow we should conduct policy in this new framework  one obviously is using our
balance sheet to influence the size of our monetary liabilities in an attempt to influence the
growth of the publics nominal expenditures and the other is to use our balance sheet to
intervene in market segments that seem particularly strained and where consequences for the
broader economy appear to be particularly significant
i think that the term assetbacked securities loan facility which is our next program to be
implemented is illuminating here and raises significant questions about these two schools of
thought  so i want to explore it for just a couple of minutes  it is aimed at improving conditions
in the market for securitizations of credit card auto and small business loans with the hope of
improving the securitization markets functioning and thus increasing the flow of credit to
consumers and small businesses  quarterly interest rates on such securitizations have been
exorbitantly high of latei think ms mossers presentation had them up about 500 to 600 basis
points over liborand new issuance fell to virtually zero in the last quarter as i understand it
expected loss rates on the underlying loan portfolios have risen significantly since september
but there are some who argue that the spreads on aaa tranches are far too high to be explained
by increasing loss rates alone  another relevant factor is that there has been a widespread
pullback from structured finance  investors have lost confidence in some of the inputs into the
securitization processrating agency assessments would be an obvious oneso investors are
not willing to pay nearly as much now for consumer loan securitizations as they once were  in
addition one hears other reports that some investors in this class of securitization are more
reluctant to hold these securities now because of marktomarket volatility which for this class
of investors passes through their income statement in contrast with some of the issuers who if
they hold the same securitizations on their own balance sheet dont have to run marktomarket
changes through their balance sheets  so there is a certain comparative advantage in accounting
treatment to the issuers holding these
this leads me to the next thing  i think the other side of these securitization markets
bears a careful look  we happen to have two of the largest credit card abs issuers in our
district  both of these firms have simply declined to issue securitizations because it is cheaper
to use their balance sheet  their funding coststhere was one issue 2 percent year and a half
moneysome of them quote 1 percent for brokered deposits  in comparison with that the
spreads in the secondary market that ms mosser quoted are something like 5 or 6 percent  so
there is no way in which it makes sense for them to actually do the securitization  instead they
just hold it on the balance sheet  in essence their demand for securitization funding is very
elastic because the closest substitute is not much more costly  as a result the increase in
funding costs hasnt been nearly as much for them as the increase in these spreads would
indicate
now you might think that the pressure this puts on these banks balance sheets would
lead them to cut back credit extension at the margin as a result of this  but both of these
institutions report quite clearly and emphatically that their lending termsthat is to say the
decision algorithms for what to grant an individual consumerhave not changed as a result of
this  they are still chasing consumers who are creditworthy  these are getting harder to find
because consumers are generally riskier now  but these banks policies have not changed
because of what has happened in the securitization markets  this suggests that the disruption in
securitization markets has had little effect on consumer credit availability  this is consistent
with evidence that i found in the back of the greenbook that interest rates on credit cards and
auto loans have fallen not risen over the past several months despite the increase in the abs
spreads which would make you think that they would be rising
more broadly securitization is a mechanism for reallocating risk  but more
fundamentally it is a mechanism for arbitraging capital requirements and getting a more
favorable regulatory treatment capital treatment by moving things off balance sheets  so the
question is do we have a policy interest in further subsidizing regulatory capital arbitrage  i
dont think the answer is yes and i dont think we have a broader interest in subsidizing
securitization markets compared with onbalancesheet lending  moreover at the end of the
year banks are going to have to consolidate these securitizations on their balance sheets anyway
under fas 140  so i am led to wonder  do we have a policy interest in reversing the steps they
have taken already to adjust to this new accounting regime  again i dont think the answer is
yes  so the bottom line about the talf is that i dont think it addresses a demonstrable
market failure  as i will speak about in a minute i think doing this would channel credit away
from other worthy borrowers  i think it exacerbates moral hazard and i think it sets bad fiscal
precedence
if we are going to expand our balance sheetand i do think it makes sense to do so right
nowi believe we should do so in a way that is as neutral as possible across market segments  i
think the best way to do this is to purchase us treasuries  what effect would this have  well
the natural benchmark the simplest model you would write downand there are more
complicated models in which something else would happenis one in which the presumption
would be that risky financial assets are priced off riskfree treasuries based on the standard risk
considerations the standard assetpricing considerations  i dont see any particular reason to
believe that those spreads would move one way or another in response to a change in medium
and longterm treasury yields  the staff memo on purchasing longterm securities gives a
number of reasons that they recommend against the idea and frankly i dont find them very
compelling because most of them apply with equal force to a targeted credit program like the
talf  the risk of increasing inflation by monetizing debt applies to both public and private
debt i think  the risk of taxpayer loss would seem to be even more of an issue if we take on
credit risk in addition to interest rate risk
we heard earlier about our purchases of 30year mortgagebacked securities and agency
bonds  the deleterious effects of distorting relationships among various interest rates would
seem to be more of a problem for targeted credit programs than buying us treasuries  on this
last point the thought experiment i carry around in my head about this is to compare a targeted
credit program such as talf with a same dollar amount purchase of us treasuries  the effect
on the monetary base is going to be the same by assumption  but buying treasuries is likely to
lower rates across the board in the private sector whereas the credit program is just going to
lower the target rates leaving rates in nontargeted market segments higher than they would be if
we bought treasuries  in other words choosing a targeted credit program over buying
treasuries is like deciding to lower rates for borrowers in the targeted segment by drawing away
funds from other sectors and raising rates in other sectors compared with a program of buying a
riskfree security like treasuries  i dont see a compelling reason to raise some borrowers
interest rates in order to lower some other borrowers interest rates  in particular it is hard for
me to see how we know this would have a positive effect on aggregate demand on net
now obviously we have a collection of credit programs on our books already and we
have been discussing the fundamental problem that these are likely to pose when the time comes
for us to withdraw monetary stimulus  the solution that i think you are right to pursue with the
treasuryand i would like to propose and i would advocateis that we transfer financing of
our credit programs wholesale to the us treasury and that we work to establish a new
understandingcall it a treasuryfed credit accord if you wantunder which we would agree
that henceforth intervention in credit markets apart from our usual peacetimelike discount
window functioning will be the responsibility of the us treasury
this would give us back control of the monetary liabilities on our balance sheet and
would make it much simpler to find an exit strategy  it would reduce the risk of loss to our
capital accounts and the attendant reputational risk  it would reduce the risk perceived by market
participants that we might abruptly terminate some credit programs in order to reduce the
monetary base  it would reduce the risk perceived by market participants that we might
compromise inflation in order to sustain credit programs  it would also reduce our vulnerability
to the charge that we are using federal monies outside the constitutional appropriations process
and that we have abused our powers by disguising asset purchases and credit guarantees for
which we do not have explicit authority as loans  this is what we have done in the citigroup
and bank of america case and it is one thing that makes me very uncomfortable about those
programs and would lead me to favor proposing that the treasury take on those guarantees as
well because there is nothing in principle that limits their ability or the fdics ability to have
taken on all of the risk in both of those cases
in short my view is that no matter how you feel about our credit programswhether
you are for them or agin themit would be better for the treasury to finance them  i dont see
any operational impediment to transferring our credit programs to the treasury  our expertise is
very critical to them of course but we have been lending our expertise to the treasury for
decades by performing fiscal functions for them and helping them run their debt auctions and we
have recently lent our people to staff the tarp and i dont see any reason that our people
couldnt continue to be involved in the administration of programs  the treasury would
obviously have to issue additional debt to finance the programs but the fed would in the first
instance have an equal demand for us treasury debt  from the publics point of view the
initial implementation would leave their balance sheets unaffected  then over time we could
vary the size of our balance sheet independently of the size of the credit programs
i think you are right mr chairman that this would be an uphill climb  it would require
broad agreement with the administration and the congress and perhaps even legislation  but i
think you are also right to note that this is an excellent opportunity in this regard  we are on the
cusp of sweeping revisions of decadesold laws governing financial regulation  consideration is
being given as you noted to forming a socalled aggregator bank  so i think it is a very good
time to initiate a new understanding of the appropriate roles of the central bank and the fiscal
authority  so i applaud your efforts to pursue those discussions  there may be an aversion to
spending our political capitaland i know we marshal that very carefully here in the system
on such a request  but we were willing to spend political capital in 1951 to gain control of the
liability side of our balance sheet  that is what the original treasuryfed accord did and that
has been essential to the independent conduct of monetary policy since then  so i think we are
entitled to exert ourselves politically on this one  thank you very much mr chairman  i
appreciate your indulgence
chairman bernanke  thank you  i think in principle that we agree that it would
be better to have all of this done by the treasury  i think we have to accept political realities
prioritize and try to address the most important issues first and see how far we can get
on treasuries versus other purchases i dont want to get deeply into it but any kind of
model without perfect complete markets has to recognize the existence of liquidity premiums
which can differ across markets and which affect the effect of a given amount of demand on a
purchase of a given asset  so it isnt evident that applying our purchasing power on assets where
markets are deep and liquid and liquidity premiums are low would have the same effect as on
other markets where liquidity premiums are high  but i am just addressing that there is a reason
that it is not a purely neutral operation  yes
mr lacker  i dont want to go deeply into technical details either but a certain
presumption with regard to credit risk is that there are potentially adverse consequences of
distorting relative credit risks across markets  i dont see why the same thing shouldnt apply to
liquidity risk
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  i would say that the markets are already distorted  we
are starting from a point of the market not in equilibrium in the sense of normal longtime
functioning  we are starting with markets that are very out of joint relative to where they have
been historically  so to say that you are distorting markets by the intervention in fact we are
actually trying to push markets back to something closer toward normality
about your point whether there is a market failure in the securitization market i think
there is absolutely a market failure in the securitization market and you basically cited what it
was  the very fact that securitization rates are well above the rates that the banks would demand
to hold it on their own balance sheet tells you that the market is fundamentally broken down  it
is certainly true that those particular banks that you cited may not be balance sheet constrained
but the banking system as a whole is clearly balance sheet constrained  what the talf does is
basically provide balance sheet capacity to the private sector that the banking system today
cannot provide
also even if the abs market is functional for those two banks that you note there are a
whole bunch of other problem areas in the securitization market that the talf could be used to
address in the future  for example the commercial real estate market is an area about which lots
of people have been coming to us and saying we are going to have a real problem refinancing
the commercial mortgage loans that come due in 2009 because there is no balance sheet capacity
in the commercial banking sector  so although it may be true for the two particular banks that
you described i dont think it is true for the banking system as a whole  i think that the talf
can address a real market failure because it provides a number of things that the market cant get
right now which are balance sheet capacity protection against downside risk and term funding
those three things are not available in the market right now
chairman bernanke  president fisher you had a twohanded intervention
mr fisher  i do want just to jump in  i thought your response was appropriate and
correct and obviously ultimately we would like to put as much of this back to the treasury as
possible  the ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible
from political pressures so we can do what central bankers do  i might also add as much as
possible from market pressures but that is another matter  but i disagree with the point made
and i agree with the staff conclusionwith regard to the purchase of treasuries  it strikes me
that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for openended stimulus in
fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy  i am
very reluctant to go down that road  that strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the
staff made  at any rate at this point i dont think it is necessary  rates are quite low as they are
i disagree jeffrey in ideal market situations as the vice chairman just pointed outwhatever
you are of this committee laughter
vice chairman dudley  i am still trying to figure that out myself
mr fisher  as one of our many vice chairmen pointed out this is a highly distorted
market and i would suggesti was listening to what you saidin fact the effort may lower
treasury rates at the price of raising other rates that you might crowd out perversely by
supporting the treasury market at this juncture  so i would support the staffs recommendations
because we have so many things on the table i did have a question with regard to brians
point  that is when would we consider closing a facility  as long as we have these different
facilities openand we havent shoved everything over to the treasurymight it not send a
good signal to the marketand i know president plosser is probably going to talk about this a
little too because we talked about it at lunch just to be opento close down one of these
facilities that was not being utilized  for example the amlf or the mmiffall of these
initialisms are getting confusingif they are not active do we want to give to all of them the
same time extension  that is my question  now you might respond that we dont know yet but
they might be utilized  i havent read through the specifics of your language proposition but
might we not at least make it clear that if we feel that we have leeway we could close down any
one of these facilities while we extend their ultimate maturity  so the real question is can we
find something that we might actually close to demonstrate that we dont just have an open
ended book until we reach the point that you wish to reach mr chairman as you articulated
and as president lacker argued where we shove this onto the treasury
mr madigan  i think that general principle is right  in fact in the open market area
we have wound down one programthe longterm rps  but right now i think that simply
extending the facilities does not mean that they will necessarily be in place for the entire period
of time  the fomc and the board could evaluate as time goes on whether these programs are
needed  i do think that closing down any of these programs at this time does run the risk of
sending a signal that you think you are pretty far along in this process and you are going to start
closing things down relatively quickly  so i think it carries a risk
chairman bernanke  trish
ms mosser  for what it is worth i think that the signal to markets of closing even the
dormant facilities given my obvious view about how fragile things are could actually have a
pretty serious significant adverse effect even though they are not being used  they are viewed
very muchparticularly the two facilities you mentioned and particularly the mmiffas a
backstop  we dont need it now  it is not priced attractively frankly given the spreads in
markets  but should we go through another period heaven forbid like september and october
it would be used according to market participants
chairman bernanke  president plosser has been very patient  may i turn to you
mr plosser  well some of my remarks were in fact going to be exactly this point
that we need an opportunity to bolster our credibility  as president fisher said i think we have
an opportunity  the amlf in particular is winding down  it is not being used very heavily
and indeed it is a facility that is almost redundant given that we have the commercial paper
facility and the mmiff and all of those three programs are intimately related to one another  it
doesnt appear to me at all obvious that we need all of them  whatever the amlf is providing
could also be provided as backstop through the cp program and through the mmiff  so i think
we could do ourselves a real favor and signal to the market that we are judicious careful and
wise about our choice of programsthat when we believe we have redundancies in the programs
we dont just let them run on and on and on  i think it would do a lot for our credibility
there is another program that we havent really talked about in a while and that i think
we could also eliminate without much consequence and have again a credibility issue with the
distinction between us and the treasury  in august we had an agreement with the treasury to
allow the gses to borrow from the discount window  the argument in that case was that we
were doing that because the treasury did not yet have the appropriations to do the lending and
they needed to get that worked out  they certainly now have that and indeed the gses are
wards of the state  to the best of my knowledge we have never lent to the gses through the
discount window  i dont anticipate that there is any prospect that we will  the fact is that we
are buying agency debt as it is  to the best of my knowledge we havent rescinded that
authorizationor at least the board hasnt rescinded that authorization
so i think these are two examples in which programs are actually not doing anything
particularly  we have other means of backstopping the markets that we are worried about  by
beginning to show that we can be thoughtful in how we unwind some of this stuff it could
actually be a credibilitybuilding device  to the extent that there are very very fuzzy lines out
there in the world among the political classes including the public about where the boundaries
are drawn between fiscal policy and monetary policywhich i believe is the casethese two
actions might help us draw back and gain a little more clarity about what we are about and what
we are not about  i would just say mr chairman that i applaud your efforts with the treasury
on this and i support them 100 percent and will do anything i can to help that along because i
think it is a very very important step  i think that we could have an opportunity by extending
some of the programs but not extending those that arent really doing anything
as long as i have the floor mr chairman i would like to comment on a couple of other
things  i think we need to work harder on developing the specific informationthat is both data
and qualitative informationthat we need to make our decisions exactly about extending or
exiting from these facilities and any new ones that we might create  this would help our own
policy deliberations making us more systematic in our approach and would be beneficial to
market participants helping them learn what to expect from us  although the decision today for
many of you may seem obvious that we should extend all of these facilities for fear of disrupting
something or other i think that as we get closer in time to a situation in which we really do want
to exit these programs the decision process will become more difficult  having a more
systematic datadriven approach to making that decision in advance will do a lot to help us as
we move forward
we presumably want to look at metrics to gauge the efficiency of these facilities in
improving the functioning of particular markets  in the past we saw a great deal of information
on spreads but as i have said before i dont consider spreads as sufficient information
volumes are important as well as i have stressed  i appreciate the work of spence and the staff
i thought that the detailed discussions of the different programs were very helpful and i applaud
the staff for that effort  but we also need to know what to do with those data and how we
interpret and analyze the information  as has been alluded to already if trading is thin for
example some spread measures may be completely irrelevant to thinking about some of this
information  it may be a demand problem as opposed to a market liquidity problem  moreover
i think we need an idea of what level of spreads and volumes we will be satisfied with when the
time comes  the memo from vice chairman dudley on desk authorizations talks about
reducing spread levels more in line with historical norms  is that the right level  what does that
mean  does it mean that we have spread levels similar to those in july 2007  i very much
doubt that  shouldnt we be thinking that these spreads will be elevated perhaps for some time to
come given the real credit risks that have been revealed in the current episode  if so how much
higher  and shouldnt we be thinking about spread levels consistent with weak or recessionary
economic periods as a more proper benchmark in this environment  it is certainly true that
spreads on some consumertype loans are very high  but many are not out of line with what we
have witnessed in other recessionary periods  how do we tell the difference and how do we
think about that
in addition to the extent that privatesector intermediation is broken and the feds
lending facilities are substituting for some of that role it seems to me that you want to look at
metrics to gauge the degree of privatesector intermediation  i think that we need to focus more
on the health of the banking sector itself such things as loan growth and the use of reserves in
the banking sector  as i discussed last time i think quantities of these various measures on our
balance sheet will be relevant for those sorts of discussions as to how we think that
intermediation process is functioning  we need to pay attention to how we set prices in these
facilities  we want to ensure that our lending facilities dont crowd out privatesector
intermediaries when they are healthy enough to return to the market  otherwise of course we
risk distorting the real price signals and potentially delaying the recovery of creditmarket
functioning  more discussion of pricesetting in our facilities would be welcome  we heard
some of that today and i applaud that  do we have the right penalty rates built in  are the
auctions set at the right minimums  referring to these on a regular basis and discussing the
implications they have on volumes would help us be alert to changes in markets and their
functioning and help ensure that we are not delaying the markets from healing themselves  so
overall i think we should have a much more systematic analysis and discussion of these sorts of
issues if we are to properly assess the effectiveness and necessity of these facilities
i have already talked about terminating some of these programs  by letting programs like
the authorization of the gses and the amlf expirei think they are redundantand canceling
this emergency access to the discount window we can strengthen our credibility we can further
delineate the line between fiscal policy and monetary policy or between the treasury and the
central bank and we will strengthen the belief that we in fact will withdraw from these special
arrangements at the appropriate time and do so in a thoughtful way
i would like to talk just a bit about the purchases of longterm treasuries  the staff
recommends keeping this program at bay for now or at least not implementing it  i dont really
have any strong objections to that  i think the staffs memo though omitted one reason that
buying treasuries in fact might be desirable and i really didnt find its arguments for not doing
it terribly compelling either  i see some benefits to having more treasuries in our portfolio
regardless of how one assesses the magnitude of the real economic effect on borrowing  it might
prove easierand i think this gets back to the accord mr chairman in your discussionfor us
to unwind from some of these things if in fact we have treasuries rather than mbs  i think our
credit programs do carry risks  aside from the moral hazard problems we have created we face
challenges when we attempt to liquidate particularly nontreasury assets from our portfolio  we
will get pressure from various interest groups to retain certain assets  we will certainly in all
likelihood get calls from consumers builders and congressmen if we start to sell mortgage
backed securities out of our portfolio in order to reduce its size  we will hear fears that the
mortgage rates may rise  we will have some market participants resisting our desire to pull back
from our credit programs fearing that markets remain too fragile or the economys headwinds
are too strong  i think we will make every effort to resist such pressures but they could make it
difficult for us to conduct monetary policy in a way that is consistent with our mandate
particularly our mandate for price stability  moreover given that we have crossed the bridge on
credit allocation schemes to specific markets it will be much easier in the future for special
interest groups to ask us to repeat such actions especially if they cant get the answers they want
from the political process
thus i thinkand i realize this view isnt shared by allthat the credit allocation
schemes we are pursuing run a real risk of impinging on our independence and our ability to
control our balance sheet and hence monetary policy  again drawing back from the amlf
and perhaps the gse discount window lending facility may help us begin to reassert a bit of that
independence  for that reason i am not uncomfortable with buying longterm treasuries partly
because of their portfolio effect as a substitute for buying mbs  mr chairman i think that your
comments about moving more of this to the treasury are exactly right and it certainly applies to
maiden lane  i think it would apply to the cpff in some respects and perhaps to the talf as
president lacker was suggesting  i didnt find the staffs arguments against purchasing long
term treasuries particularly compelling  i guess i share president lackers view that if we are
blowing up our balance sheetwhether we are blowing it up with mbs or with treasuriesit is
still expansionary monetary policy as far as i am concerned and i dont think it should make that
much difference on inflationary expectations  the staff also raised the problem of interest rate
risks inherent in longerterm treasuries  again i dont see this as a particular problem distinct
from our purchases of mortgagebacked securities which also contain interest rate risk at the end
of the day if we have to sell them  both of these programs increase the maturity mismatch on
our balance sheet in very similar ways
i am a little puzzledmaybe i will save this for the policy goroundabout why we
should leave the door open in the statement  the estimated reduction in longerterm yields as
the staff suggested is somewhere between 10 and 30 basis points which is at best quite
uncertain based on the empirical evidence  putting aside my concern for portfolio composition
and my preferring treasuries i dont find buying longterm treasuries that compelling except
for this portfolio reason  thus a better reason for leaving the door open may be this portfolio
argument but i dont think we could explain that very well  we could simply say that we
continue to weigh the costs and benefits  but i do have some reservations about continuing to
discuss in our statement programs or actions that we might or might not take  i think that there
are certain risks to that in terms of making markets believe that we may do something and then
if we dont do it we lose some credibility  but we can talk about that in the policy goround
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker you had a quick twohander
mr lacker  in the interest of your interest in informal exchange i was interested in
responding to our new vice chairman
chairman bernanke  okay
mr lacker  i dont understand in what sense the observation that prices are low and
that quantities are very low constitutes a demonstration that the consumerbacked abs market is
broken down  can you think of a model in which that results  yes demand is low and supply
is elastic  i sketched out one  what we are talking about it is important to remember here is the
interaction the rivalry between the balance sheet channel of credit flows and the securitization
channel  a broad array of contractual features are important to the relative attractiveness for
market participants of those two channelscovenants risk allocation regulatory and accounting
treatments and the like  on balance sheet constraintswould some firms prefer that the demand
for securitization be higher high enough that securitization was less costly for them than holding
it on balance sheet  yes i am sure that is true  but if that is the criterion for whether or not a
market is broken down then it is hard to see the difference between a market being broken down
and just regulatory capture in some broad sense
you talked about markets being distorted already  i can picture information constraints
verification costs asymmetries and the like that would lead market outcomes to be less
felicitous for all concerned than they otherwise would be  but yes information constraints
constrain achievable outcomes but so do technology constraints  would we be better off if we
could get more output with the same amount of labor and capital  yes we would  but i dont
think you would call the market distorted because that is the case
the question is why it is distorted  if you come to me with a modelwith some story
not even a modelthat sketches out the interaction of information with technologies and with
market participants incentives that convinces me that markets are distorted in a way that
government intervention can remedy i am all ears and i would be happy to talk about it  i have
been asking for that for a year and a half  i have been even doing the work for you  i have been
even bringing models to the table  i havent gotten any information or any market observations
that seem consistent with one story or another  i am not sure that this request has been taken
seriously  so yes if markets are distorted by something or other fine but that is hardly an
answer for justifying the talf in my view
vice chairman dudley  i guess this deserves an answer  laughter  well first
of all i think we have a fundamental disagreement about how we are looking at the current set of
events  i think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium not an equilibrium  you are looking for
models that describe equilibrium outcomes and i think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium
caused by the massive deleveraging of the nonbank balance sheet  as that process unfolds we
are not where your model wants to describe
number two what we are observing is well outside the realm of historical experience
so i think that to be able to produce a model that describes what we are seeing is very very
difficult because we have never been here before  we are just generating the empirical data now
to develop the model that we can actually test  in terms of this issueis the securitization
market evidence of market failurei think my example is just a very simple one  the fact that
the bank as you describe it would rather hold these assets on its balance sheet than securitize
them and aaa yields are higher than the net return to the bank of holding them on its balance
sheet is telling you that there is a lack of arbitrage between the bank market and the nonbank
market
i think fundamentally we have a disagreement about what the process is that we are
describing  you say show me a model  i certainly want to see your model that describes
what has happened over the past 18 months because i think it is very very difficult to show that
model as well
chairman bernanke  i am going to regret this but i am going to ask you a
question  laughter  do you think the united states economy is at a pareto efficient point at
this moment
mr lacker  probably
chairman bernanke  with the best position we can be at right now
mr lacker  roughly speaking  all constraints taken on board
participant  what was the question again
chairman bernanke  the question was is the united states economy at a pareto
efficient point at this moment  and the answer was yes  okay  so that is obviously a
different view
vice chairman dudley  yes that is a fundamental basis of the disagreement
chairman bernanke  okay
mr evans  may i ask an information question
chairman bernanke  yes
mr evans  president lacker alluded to two banks that funded their operations at a
very low rate  was that with the fdic senior guarantee on their debt
mr lacker  one of them
mr evans  that is a distortion that is helping them right  i am running into that
when i talk to a lot of people  i will come back to that
mr lacker  i am fine with that but
mr evans  well that is a distortion
mr lacker  that is a government intervention  are we intervening to make
securitization just as subsidized as bank balance sheets
mr evans  our problem is that there is one distortion here and then there is
something else and then they dont offset or they do offset and people are inside or they are not
mr lacker  if we are in a world of second best i understand that
vice chairman dudley  we are in that world  we definitely are
mr lacker  well then what is it that unfairly tilts the playing field toward bank
balance sheets  i mean you have this regulatory tax and it tilts in the other direction
vice chairman dudley  you are exactly right that historically the securitization
market has had elements of regulatory arbitrage  i think that is true  but i think in this
particular case it is not really the reason that aaa abs assets are still selling at such high yields
right now  the reason that they are selling at high yields right now is that the borrowers who
would love to invest in these assets on a leveraged basis cant get leverage  their inability to get
leverage is being driven by the balance sheet constraints of the dealer and bank community
which is a disequilibrium event caused by their historically large marktomarket losses and
loanloss provisions which are depleting their capital and constraining their ability to lend  so
this is a disequilibrium  five years from now we wont be here and banks will have the ability
to lend they will be able to lend on aaa assets on a leveraged based and aaa yields will be
much lower
chairman bernanke  let me just say in response to president plosser i should
tell everyone that assuming that we extend these programs and the swaps we will not announce
anything until thursday morning because we want to coordinate with the foreign central banks
is that correct
vice chairman dudley  yes
chairman bernanke  so first of all obviously please keep it confidential  but
could i ask the board and the new york staff to have at least a discussion about the two
programs that president plosser mentioned the gse approval and the amlf  i think i would
propose to extend the amlf today as part of the package but the board would have the ability
to reverse that tomorrow by notation vote if we decide that we get some kind of support  okay
mr plosser  the amlf is not the fomc it is the board
chairman bernanke  i understand that but what i am saying is that i am hearing
what you are saying and i think we ought to look at that particular program  we have to be a
little careful because we dont have a lot of advance time here  but we should look at that
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker quickly
mr lacker  just real quickly  disequilibrium in this context is a non sequitur  it is
a conversation stopper  it is like appealing to astrologyit is the equivalent of that  if we are
out of equilibrium what happens out of equilibrium  what is determining what happens
people make choices on their way to making adjustments  they were in equilibrium when they
made the choices that resulted in the losses and now that equilibrium is playing out obviously
would these leveraged borrowers like there to be a greater demand for their liabilities  yes
this all looks as though demand is low  i will ask you a question  the buggy whip industryis
that sector broken
chairman bernanke  president hoenig on that note
mr hoenig  oh wow  laughter  only 45 minutes later
mr lockhart  can you answer the buggy whip question  laughter
mr hoenig  i have heard that story and i dont need to review it again  i have just a
couple of things that i want to comment on here  first of all i do appreciate this because we are
thinking about where we are and we are thinking about how we might exit this even though we
have a lot of turmoil ahead of us  that much i appreciate  i think that part of president lackers
point and the vice chairmans point may be that we are in an adjustment process  we are
deleveraging like crazy in this economy  that resulted from an excess at an earlier point and we
are going to find a new equilibrium  that is the process we are going through and it is very
difficult
much of what we have done i wish had been done in the treasury to begin with  i still
think that would have been the right call  but it wasnt so we are where we are  how do we get
where we are going and how do we do this transition  what we have are these facilities and i
hope that we use them temporarily  i hope we do take advantage of working with the treasury
to move as much of it out as we can  some of it is selfliquidating and i think we will get out of
it  but some of it is not and that is the part i would like to be able to push toward the treasury
and that would be part of our plan  i would also say that i am reluctant to go with longterm
treasuries not because i dont necessarily agree with some of what you are saying but because i
am worried about some of the consequences of the perception that we are directly funding the
treasury and monetizing debt immediately  i want to think that through before i get on that
bandwagon given where we have already come at this point
to change just a bit mr chairman i want to talk about the tarp and the future as we
go forward as you have these discussions coming up  i think there is no confidence in it  it has
been inequitably administered across the united states and that is why you have such bitterness
about it  so in looking forward we have an opportunity to do that better  the way we outline
how we are going to deal with financial institutions and banks in the future is extremely
important now  i want to thank nathan for the summary report on the swedish experience or the
nordic model and so forth because as we talk about aggregator banks or rtcs or some
approach to the problem i think that is a very good model to look at  it offers us opportunities to
deal with this problem as it gets worse because i think the problems across a broader base of
banks are getting worse  commercial real estate is now feeling a little pressure  i think we are
beginning to see a turn in agriculture again and a turn related to energy  these problems are
going to become more difficult and how we go forward with the next iterationand i wouldnt
call it the tarp any longerof this banking problem is important
one thing that i have some disagreement with regarding nathans conclusions is whether
we have the mechanisms to do a kind of swedish model given the morecomplex institutions
and the size of this country  but i suggest that we do  we have a cadre of experienced people
across the united statesin the comptrollers office the fdics office and the federal
reserves officesso that when this comes if we think about it now and plan we can begin to
say which banks should be looked at
part of the problem with the last issue of the tarp was that we went in and looked at a
lot of these institutions and they were on the margin  but we were changing the criteria as we
went along instead of having the criteria set and going in and looking at these institutions
which ones are solvent at the moment and for which ones would capital help maintain
solvency  you cant have any guarantees on this given the trends in the economy  but we
ought to have a systematic equitably applied solution for the next wave that is coming our way
that would be very important to have set up because it would help keep a lot of commercial real
estate loans off our balance sheets  if we handle the next section as we have the past around
assetbacked securities we are going to have a lot more assets on our balance sheet and that
does worry me  so that is something for us to think about going forward
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  first of all mr chairman i agree with your prioritization that to
the extent possible it makes sense for the programs that have substantial credit risk to be borne
by the treasury  obviously certain circumstances forced other decisions along the way but i
think that is a good prioritization  then the second prioritization is that ideally we would be
focused on markets and not individual names and thats consistent with moving the maiden
lane facilities over to the treasury to the extent possible  i think both of those prioritizations
make sense
on the amlf i actually was roughly at the same point in november and its size has
come down since then  it has been interesting  i have had a number of discussions with a
variety of mutual funds about winding down the amlf  they dont view the amlf as being
the same animal as the other money market facility and i have been told that it will take severe
duress before they use the other facility because they are worried about stigmatizing themselves
as for the amlf because it is the sale of assetbacked securities there is not the same stigma
attached  so actually we had 800 million come in today  it was a money market fund that has
experienced very substantial runoffs that are not occurring with other organizations  i have been
told that even if it goes down to a small number money market funds willingness not to hold
extensive cash balances or very short term maturities is in part due to the fact that they can
liquidate their positions in assetbacked securities relatively quickly  the amlf is not ideally
structuredi definitely agree with thatbut i am not sure that the other facilities are perfect
substitutes  if we were not to extend it i would want to do that only after some discussion with a
number of money market fund families because i think we might find that it would have an
effect on their willingness a to hold assetbacked commercial paper and b to hold a variety of
other assets  i think that they would look for other ways to get much more liquid because as has
been highlighted the financial markets are very fragile
mr plosser  may i just ask about that  the assetbacked paper that actually comes
through the amlf is it mostly commercial paper
mr rosengren  it is all assetbacked commercial paper  its all a1p1 assetbacked
commercial paper
mr plosser  so they could also sell that into our commercial paper facility could
they not
mr rosengren  they are not issuers  this is a money market fund  the
commercial paper facility is for issuers of commercial paper  the amlf is for money market
funds  so they are not the same
vice chairman dudley  the issuer in principle could buy it back from the
money market fund and then potentially issue into the cpff but that is not an obligation that the
issuer would necessarily have
mr plosser  thank you
mr rosengren  there has been an unwillingness to do that actually  it has been the
experience of the money market funds
in a more general sense i think that since the end of the third quarter we have been in a
situation in which both the securitization market has broken down and bank balance sheets are
quite constrained which is why we have seen spreads that are very very large  i do think that
the various shortterm credit facilities that we have established have both brought the spread
down and brought more liquidity to the market more generally  so in a general context those
facilities have been quite beneficial
i have just a couple of short comments  first in the earlier presentation i noted that
tangible common equity was highlighted in the slides and i would say that a lot of our programs
have been tied to preferred equity and the markets moodys and the rating agencies are focused
on tangible equity  so whatever we do going forward i think we need to spend a lot more time
thinking about tangible common equity because we are seeing in supervision presentations that
institutions that have substantial excess capital by regulatory ratios are also sometimes
institutions that the market is running away from because when they do the tangible equity
calculation its a problem  so we ought to give a little more thought to common shares going
forward
second i come out in a different place related to our purchase of mortgagebacked
securities and gses  mortgage rates have been around 6 percent for a year and a half  after the
announcement of the program they went down to 5 percent  the housing market has been the
epicenter of this problem  it is a problem both for the housing market and for financial
institutions  rather than cutting back on that program if we are trying to have an effect on
borrowing costs that affect the economy that program would be the one i would expand  i
would expand that program and not do treasury securities because treasury securities are the
one asset that everybody wants to buy now  so i am not sure that we have to get in line with
everybody else to buy the same thing that everybody else wants and push down a rate that is
already low  the problem is not that treasury securities are too high  the problem is that
everything else is high relative to treasury securities  so if we want to lower borrowing costs
that is exactly what some of these facilities are designed to do and that is what i think we need
to do  so i am supportive of doing more actually for the mortgage market and that is for
discussion tomorrow
the talf is of the same nature and i think it actually is quite beneficial  i would hope
that we could get it operational as quickly as possible  i know that dealing with accountants
lawyers and others becomes very complicated but i think that the sooner we get that up and
running the better  i do question whether the size is going to be appropriate if we really want to
have a significant effect  we are going to have to look at both the size of that facility and the
assets that we are thinking aboutparticularly the cmbs market that was alluded to  it is
designed to deal primarily with original issuers of these securities  another question that is
similar to the problem assetfor holders of those securities you could have a talflike
program that deals with people who are holding those assets rather than issuing those assets
that gets more at the financial institutions issues rather than at the issuers issues but i think
that is another program that we should at least think about as an alternative  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  i agree with you president rosengren about the objective of trying to
lower the spread on the mbs and the mortgage market is important  however another way of
expressing one of my concerns is that as we continue to focus on one asset class at a time
mortgagebacked securities assetbacked credit card debt auto loansi worry that we are
gradually being drawn into an everwider array of private credit markets and private asset classes
and instruments that we will just gradually expand  where is the limit to this and how do we
define what those limits are  how do we decide what the criteria are that constitute something
important enough for us to intervene in that way  i see this creep broadening our balance sheet
in evergreater dimensions in these private credit markets  i worry that in its doing so the
implication is that almost in a negative feedback loop each market is going to become
dysfunctional by something so that it will drag us in  my desire is to have better objective
criteria that help us decide when it is appropriate and when it is not because i think that we are
just going down a slope here that is broadening the scope which is not helpful for the institution
chairman bernanke  president plosser we do have a shadow value on our
balance sheet constraint right  so we do have limits to what we can do and so we have to make
choices about where the impact will be most effective and where it will be the best for the
economy  vice chairman dudley and then president rosengren and then i am going to go
without hesitation to president evans who has been waiting
vice chairman dudley  there is a presumption in president plossers remarks
and president lackers remarks earlier that if we intervene in one market we are going to make
these other markets that are adjacent to those markets somehow worse  in fact we have seen in
several cases that it actually does not work that way  it works in just the opposite way  one
good example is the commercial paper market in which the a2p2 market has actually improved
probably in part because of the commercial paper funding facilitys taking some of the strain off
the commercial paper market  so it might work that way sometimes and improving one market
may make another market worse  but it also may be that improving the function of one market
by providing balance sheet eases the aggregate balance sheet constraint which then leads to
improvement in other adjacent markets  so it is not necessarily true that doing something in one
market makes other markets in which we are not intervening worse
mr lacker  if i may just comment on that the important thing is to keep track of
what sort of thought experiment you have in mind  a sterilized intervention or an intervention
in which you are intervening in a market and comparing that with intervening more broadly in
treasuries is one thing  another thing is an intervention that is unsterilized and that does not
pull some other assets out of the market  i would just point to ms mossers presentation which
she opened with characterizing markets as that rates in markets in which we have intervened
have broadly improved and rates in markets in which we have not intervened have broadly
deteriorated  to me that has the flavor of consistency with the notion that our issue of liabilities
and sale of treasuries is pulling funds out of other markets and increasing rates
vice chairman dudley  but did they deteriorate because of our intervention
mr lacker  we have to fund it somehow and the funding is going to pull money
from somebody right
vice chairman dudley  did they deteriorate because of our intervention or did
they deteriorate because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate  i would argue
that they deteriorated because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate not
because of our intervention
chairman bernanke  president rosengrenquickly
mr rosengren  just very quickly in terms of the allocation housing is an interest
sensitive component of gdp  every time we change interest rates we are in effect going to have
an impact on housing and it is going to be disproportionately borne by housing than other
sectors of the economy because of its interestsensitivity  i view what we are doing with the
mbs and gses as dealing with the one area that we can actually change  i think it is going to
have a much bigger effect  in the greenbook charts that we will be looking at tomorrow if we
had a fed funds rate that we could lower i do not doubt that we would be lowering the fed funds
rate if we had that possibility  we dont have that possibility  so we have to look to an
alternative asset  where is the biggest bang for the buck  its probably in housing right now
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i will just make a couple of comments based
on the discussion today  when it comes to the talf i find that i am of two minds  i do think it
will ultimately be useful for deploying important central bank liquidity in an attempt to provide
moreaccommodative conditions  but i am concerned that we are picking winners throughout
this process  when you mention that we are going to consider cmbs i am reminded of the
fellow who came to my office and gave me a presentation  he owns shopping malls and last fall
he desperately needed funding and still does but they are not worth very much at the moment
he wanted a program like this but it wasnt availablei do not know that it was anyway  i
have also received phone calls from heavy equipment manufacturers in my district  i know you
have gotten a letter from at least one of them about their finance company financing  for them
the issue is that they are unlucky enough not to have a thrift through the ots  so they cannot
get the fdic unsecuredfunding temporary guarantee on that and their assets cannot be funded
that way  there are some competitors that have access to this and they have done very well and
others that havent  as we get into this allocation type of decisionmaking i am not quite sure
how we are going about doing it  is cmbs selected because it is an important market that we
need to keep functioning or because it is going to have a particular macroeconomic effect that is
beneficial  how does that compare with other sectors and whether they are on our radar screen
or not  maybe that was the right decision but when we select certain types of assetbacked
securities to buyit is just very difficult
i also want to agree with many of the comments that president plosser made with regard
to the programs that we have  the briefing today was very helpful in describing the various
programs  i think we need some additional metrics along the lines of just routine types of
statistics so that we can see and have a better idea  your familiarity is very great with these and
ours is not as great  i have to admit as i look at it more i find that although i am very
concerned about exit strategy in general at the moment our balance sheet doesnt worry me quite
so much
finally i want to applaud your comments at the beginning mr chairman about
discussions with the treasury and that we as best we can be should be allergic to any attempts
to use our balance sheet for longterm financing  i think that is exactly right  i wish you all the
best for all of us  laughter  i have tried to grapple with the very vague discussions of
aggregator banks and when i talk to academics they do not always help me because they resist
the fact that public funds are going to be put into thisthey think that it really should be
something that public funding is not a part of
if you pick a very large number that is required to take assets off the balance sheet of
banksi do not know what the number is but it is in trillionsand then you think about how
the treasury is going to fund this the only way they can do that is by issuing treasury bonds
ms mosser was talking about how 150 billion puts strains on yields  i think you very quickly
come to our balance sheet and how we are able to leverage up and it even makes sense
because why do the gross funding through bonds when it is really a net kind of funding against
assets  so it makes a lot of sense but it causes a lot of trouble  i hope that i am wrong in
thinking about that and that there are very easy ways out of it  but those are some of our
concerns and they will be very important
chairman bernanke  i certainly agree that you cannot trust academics
laughter  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  just a couple of curiosity questions
really for the staff  if we were to convey assets to the treasury and mark them to market at that
time let us say maiden lane or aig what losses would we be recognizing at that point
chairman bernanke  well we have a marktomarket loss on the bear stearns
assets in maiden lane i  we dont have marktomarket losses in anything else  what would be
ideal would be to work out some arrangement  it would take some accounting work but at
maiden lane i we have a letter from the treasury saying that the treasury will bear those losses
through seigniorage and there should be some way to arrange an asset called future reductions of
seigniorage or something like that that would make us whole  i think that those things can be
worked through but obviously there is a lot of technical work to be done on that
mr lockhart  the second questionnobody has mentioned any particular markets
on our radar screen that if we had criteria we might intervene in  but the one on which i get
feedback is the municipal market and we have a legal issue that we cannot lend to municipalities
unless they happen to be corporations  presuming for the moment that there was some
legislative treatment of that what is the status in discussing with the treasury an intervention in
that particular market  it is a broken market as far as i can tell at this stage
chairman bernanke  that has not come up
vice chairman dudley  i would say that the market is not doing well but it is
doing better than it was a month ago  so it is improving but i am not aware of the treasury
having this on the front burner
chairman bernanke  the fiscal package has a great deal of money for states and
localities which would probably be the primary source of support for those
vice chairman dudley  in principle you could set up an spv that the
municipality issued out of  that would be the corporate entity that we would lend to  you could
do that but it is not clear whether this problem isnt going to gradually resolve itself
chairman bernanke  i do want to pick up on what president evans and president
rosengren said which is that i think it is possible to set criteria but there is a constraint on how
much we can do in terms of both size and duration and of course limits on credit risk  given
those constraints we have to make choices  although i do not think that this is actually science
here i do think we can try to think about for example interestsensitive sectors or sectors in
which our interventions will have particularly strong effects on liquidity premiums and the like
so it is not science but i do think there is a sense in which we can make those choices and in
which we are constrained  but i recognize that this is a whole new field
i would make the comment that i have had recent conversations with foreign leaders
including prime minister brownall of whom said that the federal reserve is leading the way
the united kingdom is undertaking these programs  japan is undertaking these programs  it is
becoming a new approach  when you hit zero you have to think about other ways to affect the
economy and so at least in that respect we are not the outlier anymore  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you  a lot of ground has been covered and i do not want to
rehash things that have already been said  in general i would just associate myself with
president rosengrens remarks and say that with respect to choices that we have to make i very
much agree with the idea that a focus on mortgagebacked security markets is something that can
be effective is working and deserves priority  i also want to support the point that bill dudley
and others have made about commercialmortgagebacked securities and the notion that this is
something that was announced in connection with the talf that we were studying the
possibility of extending this facility to commercialmortgagebacked securities  we have been
following this quite closely and i would like to agree with the points that bill made about this
this seems to me like something that could be the next very serious problem for the
banking system and for property prices in general  there is huge rollover risk here where we
have hundreds of billions of dollars of loans that are coming due on commercial properties for
which the underwriting was originally pretty solid  i am very concerned that the underlying
economics is now deteriorating largely because of the economy and banks obviously have very
high concentrations  a lot of banks in this area are very loath to lend  the commercial
mortgagebacked securities market seems to be completely dead  i am really very concerned
that without the ability to refinance these loans we are going to have properties dumped on the
market and we will begin to see exactly the same thing happen with commercial real estate that
we are seeing with housing  it could lead to a further wave of unnecessary bank failures  so
although i am sensitive to the idea that yes we are making decisions about what sectors are
deserving or are of priority in terms of credit allocations and there are counterarguments against
our doing that we do have choices to make and i would focus a lot of serious attention on
proceeding in that area
chairman bernanke  let me turn to governor kohn and then take a coffee break
then we can continue if people are so inclined  governor kohn
mr kohn  just a few quick points mr chairman  i agree with those who say that it is
very uncomfortable picking which markets to intervene in  i wish we werent here but we are  i
just do not see an alternative to it  i think we have been here since august 07 really when
balance sheets constraintspeople were hoarding capital and liquidityimpaired the arbitrage
among markets and central banks had to use their balance sheets to step between private parties
increasingly to take risks where the public was not willing to take risks  now governments are
going to have to step in to spend where the public isnt willing to spend  so we have this
withdrawal from risktaking this hoarding of capital not spending and the governments role
here is to step into that breach to keep the economy from shrinking even further  arbitrage is
broken  i think there are balance sheet constraints  jeffs banks in the richmond district may
say that they have not changed criteria but certainly the answers to the senior loan officer
opinion survey suggest that banks in other districts have tightened terms and standards for
making consumer loans
it is really hard to judge which markets i agree  i think they should be important markets
with systemic effects and ones where our intervention can make a difference  it is really hard to
say ahead of time but we ought to be looking for those  i agree that we need to be thinking
about exit strategies and balance sheet constraints but i sure hope we do not put emphasis on
that  i think our problem right now given where we are is not how we are going to get out of
this but how we can ameliorate the decline in the economy  the more we talk about how we
want to get out and the constraints the less effective our policies will be  i think that is what
happened to japan  the japanese central bank kept talking about how they did not really want to
be here they could not wait till they got out this was uncomfortable and they did not want to be
doing this  i think it undermined that aspect of the credibility of what the central bank was
doing  so you are right  we need to have this conversation internally  we need to keep three
chess moves ahead in what we are doing  but i wouldnt want worries about the size of our
balance sheet and our exit strategies to importantly constrain our ability to make a difference in
credit markets going forward
on the buying of treasuries i would keep that on the table  i think rates are already low
as president rosengren and others have pointed out  we do not really need to intervene there
whereas for mortgagebacked securities i think the interest rate risk is low because some of us
might argue that those rates were too high relative to treasuries and we are not taking the same
kind of risk buying at that low price versus the high price that we might be with a treasury  but
it is not really about the risk on our balance sheet  it is about the effects we can have  those
rates are already low  i do not think we need to buy treasuries at this point  i would keep that
option on the table to see what happens to those rates going forward and where we think we can
be most effective
in terms of worries about monetizing the debt here i do agree with president lacker  i
think this is about inflation and inflation expectations  we are i hope going to take some steps
to make our inflation objectives a little clearer tomorrow  i think we need to keep that in mind
and we should not have to worry about people accusing us of monetizing the debt  we should
keep our focus on the macroeconomic variables
finally on transparency we have started up as the chairman said a little working group
to see what more we can do  we are concentrating in part on the collateral side  can we say
more about collateral without impairing the functionality of our windows  we are thinking
about things we might add and publish quarterly instead of weekly and whether there is more we
could do on that basis  any suggestions that reserve banks have would be gratefully received
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a coffee break until 430
and then if anyone else would like to enter in when we come back that would be fine
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  lets resume  i do not want to cut anyone off
would anyone else like to comment  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i am going to play the role of provocateur
here and ask a couple of questions that are in the spirit of having a wideranging and strategic
discussion as we are having here  here is something that people said to me recently  this is a
question for mr sheets about swap lines one of our favorite topics  here is the statement
these swap lines are giving control of the us monetary base to foreign governments especially
through persistent and large usage by the foreign central banks  i will stop on that one and see
what you think about that
mr sheets  in each one of the disbursements under these lines the federal reserve
and the fomc have the prerogative to determine whether or not it is in our interest to go forward
with the swaps  so i think that we maintain a crucial governance role  if we come to the
conclusion that at some point the costs of this program or the costs of extending that dollar
liquidity outweigh the benefits then we can start winding up the program  so i dont think that
is right
mr bullard  so what is the magnitude right now of the swap lines that are
outstanding
mr sheets  the total outstandings are around 465 billion
mr bullard  okay  so a scenario would be that you go over the next five years
with zero nominal interest rates and an ongoing financial crisis and these things stay out there
because of needs for dollar funding in europe  now you had a permanent onetime increase of
say 500 billion in the monetary base  isnt this what we are looking at
mr sheets  well for what it is worth our forecasts of the european economy and
european interest rates are not consistent with that scenario  market expectations are not
consistent with that scenario  i hope that is not what we are looking at
mr bullard  okay  i am just trying to ask a series of provocative questions
mr sheets  you are doing a good job
mr bullard  thank you  laughter
ms mosser  may i add one parenthetical point to that  the swapsunlike the
talf for exampleare priced at a penalty to market rates and to the extent that market spreads
do come down as we have seen in the past two months swap lines do selfliquidate  they have
declined very noticeablythey were nearly 600 billion at one point  as the spreads come in
effectively the private sector comes in and undercuts the central bank which was by design
mr bullard  okay  thank you  so now i am going to try to reconcile presidents
lacker and rosengren laughter and get your and our new vice chairman dudleys reactions
my experience in economics is that it is not that helpful to talk about equilibrium and
disequilibrium  so i am going to talk about it in a different way  you have firms and people
who do the best they can given the constraints that they face  there are frictions out there and
we know what the friction is here  it is a very severe information friction in certain financial
markets  it is a crisis of financial engineering in which when the new financial instruments were
created they were thought to be good devices but they turned out to have serious transparency
issues and that created information problems  so now you say that given that friction i am
going to let everybody optimize  jeff will say well that is a pareto optimum given the friction
and if there is nothing you can do about the friction then that is the best you can do  but if there
is some policy you can do to ameliorate the friction and pull that out you will get a better
solution  i would say that that is mr dudleys position  the position that it is just technology
and there is probably nothing we can do about the crisis in financial engineering would be the
lacker position  i was wondering if you guys would react to that and see if that reflects your
views
mr lacker  i will say yes laughter with the additional note that with that answer
alone you might wonder why i get so exercised but it is that withdrawing that friction does not
seem to be what any of our programs have been designed to accomplish
mr bullard  yes and i agree with that  there seem to be a lot of things that are
being done in many parts of the government and maybe parts of the fed that are not really
getting at that information friction  so i am going to ask the most provocative question of all
the chairman said at the beginning that we should obviously be allergic to taking on credit risk
and normally i think everyone here agrees with that  but maybe now is the time to rethink that
you have a serious information problem out there  you have a lot of reactions to that that are
tangential to the core problem and we are talking about doing open market operations which
used to be always in treasuries now in mbs  it would not be that hard to say lets just do the
open market operation swap of money for a financial instrument using the toxic assets that are
such a problem in this economy  normally i would not say things like this so i am stepping out
of character  but in the interest of provoking discussion maybe now is the time to at least start
thinking about something like that  that would get to the heart of the matter  if you try to go
through the congress they are wonderful people and everything but the process gets
politicizedand we know this we are seeing that alreadyand so all kinds of other things get
done  this would get at the core of the problem  you would be taking on risk but you take on
some interest rate risk even when you buy treasuries  the whole idea would be to price these at
the right price which i understand is very tricky but who better to do it than the 500 economists
that hang out at the fed  so i dont knowshould it necessarily be a 100 percent benchmark
that we do not want to take on credit risk or should it be only a 95 percent benchmark or
something like that
chairman bernanke  let me say something about these frictions and why we can
affect them  there are two frictions that i think are important  one of them relates to the friction
of illiquidity  it is a tradition of central banking that we lend against illiquid assets when there is
a panic run and we know that panic runs are equilibrium phenomena and they can occur even
though the assets are worth more than the liabilities  i would argue that that kind of phenomenon
has generalized into a lot of aspects of our economyfor example the funding of various kinds
of offbalancesheet instruments the commercial paper market the money market mutual funds
and lots of other vehiclesand a lot of what we are doing is very much consistent in spirit with
the idea of providing backup liquidity to allow firms to meet redemption demands without
having to sell off assets into illiquid markets  i think that is the thrust of a lot of what we are
trying to do
the other type of friction that i think is important has to do with information capital
there is a sense in which the capital of the banking system is the most important wealth in the
world because it supports the information gathering and other institutional activities that banks
can do  when for whatever reason there is a loss of bank capital and their activities are
restrained and they are not able to make full use of the information and other skills that they
have that is a problem  i would argue that in a world where there are other frictionssticky
prices or wages for examplethe inability of the banks to fully use their information capital to
extend credit and make loans and make markets will lead to a bad outcome for the economy as a
whole  the intellectual argument then is that there is a social benefit a social externality to
providing more capital and that is what a lot of the tarp and these other things involve
now traditionally in your comment about credit it is not easy to make a clear distinction
there is always the issue of liquidity versus solvency and so on but it is not easy to make a clear
distinction between lending against solvent but illiquid assets versus providing capital for
informationally intensive agents like banks  so that line is not completely clear  but by history
and tradition the central bank has always leaned toward liquidity provision  the government
has always leaned toward credit allocation  i think that is a distinction that is worth trying to
preserve although admittedly we are not always going to do it perfectly  so i think we can
specify what the frictions are make coherent sense of them and try to explain how our actions
are related to them
mr bullard  we do not want to maintain that if it is going to send us into an even
more prolonged downturn  i mean it might be nice if we always did liquidity and treasury
always did credit but i am saying
chairman bernanke  well we have taken on credit risk in emergency situations
as you know  but as i promised at the beginning i think to the extent that we can use the
opportunity of a new administration and so on to clarify responsibilities in a better way then we
ought to do so  i think we all appreciate what an extraordinary situation we are in and have
experienced for the last eighteen months  a lot of what we are doing is requiring our good sense
and historical knowledge and our intuition  but as i think maybe the vice chairman mentioned
we do not really have the historical basis for all of the things that we are having to deal with
here  president lacker
mr lacker  mr chairman thank you  that was a very clear and lucid description of
what the core crystallized issues are regarding frictionsregarding the thing that in my fogged
state i was not able to articulate to vice chairman dudley a minute ago  this is what i think we
have been struggling to get our hands around and so i appreciate your clear articulation of that
as you know these are sort of classic problems in banking economics  about liquidity i
am struck by the hedge funds  to date as far as i knowmaybe new york knows about one that
is about to blow upwe have not been challenged by them  here is a set of participants not
viewed as likely to benefit from the safety net that over the past couple of years have structured
their liabilities in a way that makes them relatively insulated from runlike phenomena  that
illustrates the broader point about models of panicstricken runsthe extent to which you issue a
contract that makes you vulnerable to that is endogenous and leads me toward wondering if the
safety net has really been what is driving the instances of runlike behavior not only in the
banking system
on informational capital i think you are right on target there  obviously it was the
subject of your very seminal research inspiring to all of us  there i think about a lot of the
pulling awaypeople taking their loan accountsfrom wachovia and governor dukes bank a
year ago telling me that they were picking up customers that were uncomfortable working with
wachovia or b of a  switching costs are there for sure  but i struggle with how hard they are
and again appreciate that you have crystallized genuine scientific issues to clarify the
discussion
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  well i was just going to comment on jeffs comment  i think the hedge
fund industry for the most part has weathered this remarkably well but of course the five
biggest hedge funds goldman merrill et cetera et cetera are gone  what is left is a good deal
smaller and presumably a lot less consequential than the ones we have seen
let me just add mr chairman that i agree 100 percent with what you just said  we
have long had a system in which the commercial banking system has been a backup source of
liquidity to other financial institutions and the nonfinancial sector as well  for a variety of
reasons partially because of what has happened to capital and partially because the shadow
banking system is growing so rapidly relative to the banking system even though i would say
banks in the aggregate are continuing to play that role it has become increasingly difficult for
them to function effectively as the backup source of liquidity  i think that is an important
justification for the actions we have taken
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  just to respond jeff to the comment that the hedge funds havent
faced a runlike phenomenon  one of my contact conversations with a hedge fund manager
effectively said we are in a run  this period is a run  it is a run that has episodes at the end
of quarters and so forth so it operates a bit differently but the effect is the same
mr lacker  well if i could mr chairman just to be clearit is not that they are
not subject to runs it is that runs dont bring them down the way an institution like a classic bank
in 1932 would have been brought down by a retail run
chairman bernanke  as you point out an important point is that institutional
structures contracts and so on are endogenous and policy affects them  but we are in a
situation at this point where past is past and what is sunk is sunk  we have to deal with the
situation  and it is very very important for us to go forward to try to change the legal structure
the regulatory structure and even federal reserve operating procedures in ways that will
encourage morestable systems in the future  but at the moment the fire is burning and we have
to think about that
mr lacker  if i could that is a very important insight  it is part of the classic tension
between healing now versus looking at what we are doing as part of a repeatable process from
which people are going to be forming expectations about our future behavior  that is the
inevitable tension
chairman bernanke  yes that is right  all right  unless there is anyone else let
me thank you for a very useful discussion  i am sure that we will have more in the future but
this really sets the parameters and the issues  i took many things away from this discussion  one
of them is that we need to keep thinking about our metrics regarding the efficiency and efficacy
of our programsin particular how the shadow value of duration or illiquidity in our balance
sheet is matched against the benefits of a particular program that has certain implications for our
balance sheet  i would challenge the staffas all the hard tasks go to the staffto think more
about how we can evaluate the efficacy of our programs in particular and the opportunity costs
as well in terms of the space they take up or the duration that we create in our balance sheet
one useful exercise that we ought to be thinking about is if we were to go another step where
would it be and on what criteria would it be decided  that would perhaps answer the question
about there being no plan no control and no delimiting factors  i think that we can make
progress on trying to answer these questions  it is not going to happen immediately but i hope
over time it will help
mr lacker  i have a request mr chairman  i asked the system open market
account manager a couple of days ago but now he is not the manager anymore  laughter
vice chairman dudley  i did that on purpose
mr lacker  you just didnt want to do it  tomorrow or maybe today we will hear
about a forecast for the path of the federal funds rate  in creating that it is endogenous  it
depends on the economy but it also affects the economy  i was wondering if we could get one
for our balance sheet subject to uncertainty of all the obvious kinds  it would be useful to help
us think about the capacity of programs and extending them  i think it would be useful
chairman bernanke  i agree with that and i thought we would have done more
of that today in fact  but what we can doand what we ought to think about for future
referenceis maybe scenarios as opposed to forecasts  that might be a better way to think
about it  president plosser
mr plosser  i was going to ask exactly the same question  so thank you
chairman bernanke  all right  if we are ready we still have some votes to take
here  let me first ask the fomc to do the routine ratification of domestic open market
operations  do i have a motion
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any discussion  all in favor
participants  aye
chairman bernanke  opposed  hearing no objection thank you  all right
now to approve the extension of the programs i would like to propose that we extend the list of
programs through october 30 as proposed by the staff  we should have some discussion about
the amlf and others recognizing that even if we announce an extension rationalization down
the road or restructuring is always a possibility  so this would be a motion for the board to
extend the 133 programs
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  all board members okay with this  all right  hearing no
objection thank you  we need from the fomc a resolution to extend the swap arrangements
through october 30  a motion
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  further comments or discussion  any  all right  any
objections  not hearing any objections the motion is approved  we need a separate resolution
from the fomc to extend the tslf through october 30  motion
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  any concerns objections or comments  hearing no
objections thank you  all right  let me remind you again that this is all confidential until
thursday morning because we want to coordinate our announcements with other central banks
and we will take the opportunity to at least look at the two programs that president plosser
mentioned
let me turn now to the economic situation  boy i think it has been a while since we
were three and a half hours into the meeting before we got to the staff forecast
mr stockton  the gdp is a little smaller than it was at the start of the meeting
laughter
chairman bernanke  actually i do not want to give president lacker any
concerns about whom he is listening to  so i want to introduce dan sichel karen dynan and
trevor reeve who will be presenting the outlook  dan
mr sichel2   thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the material labeled staff presentation on the economic outlook  the incoming data largely have ratified the bleak nearterm outlook we projected in the december greenbook the spending data have painted a gloomy picture and readings on employment and production were even weaker than we had expected  starting first with the employment data the top left panel of exhibit 1 shows the dramatic worsening of the labor market in recent months  private payrolls declined almost 520000 per month on average in the fourth quarter  the panel to the right shows manufacturing industrial production excluding motor vehicles  factory output has been plummeting as manufacturers are responding aggressively to declines in both domestic and foreign demand  the motor vehicle sector has been hit particularly hard  with extremely sluggish sales automakers have been slashing productionplotted in the middle left paneland we anticipate a sizable further reduction in assemblies this quarter
turning to households the latest data confirm that consumers continue to retrench  as shown by the blue bars real pce for goods other than motor vehicles appears headed for a very large drop in the fourth quarter and we anticipate a further decline this quarter  these projections are similar to those in the last greenbook  in the housing sector starts the black line in the bottom left panel declined further last month and now are less than onequarter of their peak level in 2006  with the level of permits the red line still below starts we expect further declines in starts in the next few months  all told as shown to the right we project that real gdp contracted at an annual rate of about 5 percent last quarter  given the greater weakness in the employment and production data we have lowered our forecast for the firstquarter change in real gdp to minus 5 percent  in the second quarter the rate of decline in real gdp moderates as the new fiscal packagediscussed more in a minuteboosts demand
the top left panel of exhibit 2 summarizes the mediumterm outlook for real activity  we anticipate that recovery will begin albeit slowly in the second half of this year with real gdp projected to increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent next year output is expected to rise about 2 percent  the box to the right lists key factors contributing to the onset of recovery  financial stress begins to recede housing begins to stabilize monetary and fiscal stimulus provide a boost to demand and inventory liquidation comes to an end  regarding fiscal stimulus although the precise composition of what will be passed remains a moving target we now assume a package of 800 billion 300 billion more than what we penciled into the december greenbook  the larger size of the package is an important source of our slightly stronger outlook for economic growth than in the last greenbook  the bullets in the middle left panel highlight our estimates of the response to the various provisions of the plan  households begin spending the tax cuts of 180 billion and transfers of 90 billion when received  on the other hand we expect the investment response to the business tax cuts to be limited  in addition of the total new funding for state and local governments we project that only 40 percent will be spent by the

2  the materials used by mr sichel ms dynan and mr reeve are appended to this transcript appendix 2
end of 2010 as infrastructure projects take some time to get under way and as the spending of other grants is smoothed out somewhat
the panel to the right puts the pieces together  we estimate that the fiscal package will boost real gdp growth by a bit less than 1 percentage points this year and almost 1 percentage point next year  our estimates of the gdp effects are smaller than those of some other analysts with the discrepancy mostly reflecting our assumption of slower spendout rates by state and local governments  inventory dynamicsthe subject of the bottom panelsare another element importantly shaping the recession and recovery  the table in the bottom left reports the contributions of inventories to real gdp growth in key periods over the business cycle  the first column shows the contributions in the current episode and the second column shows averages for the postwar period  as can be seen on line 1 in the year before the peak in real gdp in 2008q2 inventories were already being liquidated aggressively in contrast to the usual positive contribution  as shown on line 2 of the table from the peak to the trough inventories hold down real gdp growth only a little  because inventory liquidation was already quite rapid before the peak once the contraction in sales got under way the rate of liquidation needed to steepen only a bit more  in contrast during many past episodes the drag from inventories was much larger as manufacturers had to play catchup once sales turned down  in the year after the trough line 3 of the table liquidation comes to an end and the swing in inventories boosts real gdp growth 1 percentage point about in line with historical averages  this increase in the inventory contribution is an important feature of the projected recovery in real gdp  karen will now discuss developments shaping the outlook for households and businesses
ms dynan  exhibit 3 covers the housing sector  as can be seen in the top left panel our forecast calls for singlefamily housing starts to bottom out in the first half of this year and to move up gradually thereafter  one factor behind the projected improvement in housing demand is the interest rate on 30year fixedrate conforming mortgages shown in the top right panel  this rate fell sharply following the november 25 announcement of the federal reserves mbs purchase program and we expect it to remain low over the next two years
that said our projected pickup in housing activity is quite modest as mortgage credit remains more difficult and more expensive to obtain than might be implied by the conforming mortgage rate alone  as summarized in the middle left panel the disappearance of nonprime mortgages from private sources makes it much more difficult to obtain mortgages for households lacking solid credit histories unable to make significant down payments or in need of low introductory interest rates  part of the gap has been filled by an increase in originations associated with federal housing administration programs but such originations remain far below the level of private nonprime originations at their peak  in addition lending is now more restrictive than in the past to those seeking to finance an amount above the conforming limit
housing demand is likely also being damped by an expectation that house prices have not reached their trough  we project that house prices will decline significantly further before flattening out at the end of 2010  as shown in the middle right panel this decline pushes one measure of the overvaluation of housing that we monitor well into negative territory  prices typically overcorrect at the end of housing cycles but this correction is amplified by the extent of the earlier overvaluation and by the excess supply of unsold new and existing homes that we foresee over the forecast period
the bottom left panel shows one implication of the bust in house pricesa rise in the share of prime and subprime mortgages with low current equity  as shown on lines 1 and 2 the recent declines in house prices have led to considerable increases in the shares of mortgages with equity below 20 percent  moreover as indicated on lines 3 and 4 the share with negative equity has also increased rapidly  these low levels of home equity along with greater job losses have pushed foreclosures shown in the bottom right panelto very high levels  in 2008 lenders initiated more than twice as many foreclosures as in 2006  notwithstanding the government foreclosure mitigation efforts embedded in our forecast we expect prime foreclosures the red portions of the bars to remain high this year before diminishing somewhat in 2010  subprime foreclosures the blue portions are projected to show a more pronounced decline largely because the stock of outstanding subprime loans is shrinking in response to the cessation of new loans and the termination through default or refinancing of existing loans
exhibit 4 features our outlook for consumer spending  real disposable personal income the blue bars in the top left panel fell in the second half of last year but real consumer spending in red declined even more sharply  disposable income is projected to step up early this year as a result of the sizable personal tax cuts and increases in transfer spending built into our forecast  despite the support from fiscal measures consumer spending is projected to increase only weakly this year and moderately next year  the saving rate the black line in the panel at the right is projected to move up sharply in early 2009 as the tax cuts are only gradually spent
we expect saving to remain elevated over the next two years in part because of the sharp drop in household wealth relative to income the red line and because of households greater uncertainty about their income prospects  we think that spending will be damped in coming quarters as well by difficult borrowing conditions  the middle left panel shows two important sources of the credit available to finance consumer spending  the blue portions of the bars correspond to housing equity tapped through home equity loans and cashout refinancings surveys suggest that households traditionally put perhaps onefifth of such funds toward consumer purchases  as can be seen mortgage equity withdrawal declined sharply last year
consumer credit the red portions of the bars also fell off over the year turning negative by the fourth quarter
the declines in household borrowing reflect to some extent reduced demand for loans as the weaker economy has led households to defer spending  however as
illustrated in the middle right panel a reduction in supply is clearly playing a role as well with banks continuing to tighten standards on consumer loans  developments in the consumer abs market are contributing to the tighter credit conditions for households  the market has seen very little issuance since october and spreads have been very high  the commercial banks that make most credit card loans have access to alternative sources of funding such as deposits and various new forms of support from the government  in contrast the finance companies affiliated with auto manufacturers which traditionally have been an important source of auto loans have not for the most part had access to these alternative sources  the bottom right panel shows the dollar volume of new loans per vehicle soldone metric of the extent to which the finance companies support sales  this indicator had been fluctuating around 5000 per vehicle but dropped to less than 3500 in november  that said loan originations should pick up this year with the expected implementation of the talf and gmac now a bank holding company having announced that it will resume lending to some consumers with weaker credit records
the next two exhibits focus on business investment and finance  the top left panel of exhibit 5 depicts a key underpinning of our investment forecastthe accelerator mechanism  business fixed investment as a share of output shown in red tends to track the lagged growth rate of output in black  the sharp deceleration that we have seen in output is expected to exert a significant drag on investment this year and next  indeed as shown by the red bars in the panel to the right we estimate that business spending on equipment and software fell nearly 10 percent last year and we project it to decline by an even larger amount this year before making a moderate recovery in 2010  investment in nonresidential structures held up better in 2008 but we expect a sharp decline this year and a further decline in 2010 due in part to the lags in planning and implementing new structures projects
spending in the business sector is also held down by credit market conditions
firms are finding credit expensive and more difficult to obtain because investors are demanding extremely high returns for holding risky assets  in the stock market the dramatic decline in equity values over the past year has pushed the trend earningsto price ratio the red line in the middle left panel well above the range seen over the past quarter century  the gap between this ratio and the real treasury perpetuity yield shaded in turquoise in the left panel and plotted as a line on the right is a rough measure of the equity risk premium  at more than 10 percentage points the gap is extraordinarily high by historical standards  spreads on corporate bonds are also extremely elevated keeping yields relatively high despite substantial declines in long term riskfree rates  as can be seen in the bottom left panel yields on 10year bbb rated bonds have fallen since the december fomc meeting but remain at the high end of their range since 2002  that said issuance of nonfinancial investmentgrade bonds shown in the inset box moved up in the fourth quarter and has held up in at a solid pace in january  yields on speculativegrade bonds shown in the bottom right panel also remain unusually high and speculativegrade issuance though up somewhat in january is still fairly weak
ci loans from commercial banks represent another important source of funding for businesses  as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 6 ci lending fell off sharply at the end of last year and we expect it to remain weak this year  we believe that the downswing partly reflected reduced demand for loans as businesses trimmed plans to invest and after relying heavily on bank lines while credit markets were disrupted in the fall turned back to other sources of funds such as corporate bonds however the supply of credit has also been reduced  as shown in the top right panel most of the senior loan officers we just surveyed reported having tightened standards on ci loans further and having increased the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds
the next four panels turn to some of the factors that have exacerbated the credit problems in the commercial real estate sector  as can be seen in the middle left panel rents the red line have decelerated sharply over the past two years and vacancy rates the black line are on the rise  prices for commercial properties shown on the right turned down sharply in late 2007 after soaring over the preceding three years  our forecast calls for a significant further price decline  these weaker conditions have contributed to rising delinquencies among commercial real estate loans as seen in the bottom left panel  the delinquency rate on such loans held by commercial banks the turquoise line climbed further in the third quarter  as shown in red the delinquency rate on loans in commercialmortgagebacked securities or cmbs has been rising as well  the box to the right summarizes key implications of the shutdown in the cmbs market  although the market traditionally has provided very little construction financing the inability to issue should add to the pressures on banks balance sheets and thereby indirectly damp structures spending  in particular if it remains closed the cmbs market will not be able to help refinance the large amount of bank construction loans expected to come due this year as it would in normal times  in addition a smaller amount of loans currently within cmbs will come due this year and will need new financing from alternative sources such as banks  dan will pick up the discussion from here
mr sichel  the top left panel of exhibit 7 provides some longerterm context for the deep recession and sluggish recovery that we are projecting  the red line shows the level of real gdp indexed to its own peak in the second quarter of last year  by way of comparison the green and blue lines show the paths of real gdp during the recessions that started in 1973 and 1981 respectively  as noted to the right the projected contraction in real gdp in the current episode is broadly in line with those two earlier big postwar recessions but the projected recovery is noticeably more sluggish  in part this pattern reflects the influence of financial turmoil on the macroeconomy
gauging the hit to the economy from the recent financial stress is to put it mildly an inexact science  one benchmark is the typical pattern experienced by economies during and after the onset of financial crises  as noted in the bullets in the middle left panel research on this topicmost notably the work by carmen reinhart and ken rogoffindicates that downturns linked to major financial crises in
advanced economies tend to be severe  reinhart and rogoff identify five major financial crises in advanced economies in the postwar period these include spain in 1977 norway in 1987 finland and sweden in 1991 and japan in 1992  the panel to the right shows one possible metric for gauging the magnitude of output loss in these episodes  the first blue bar shows average growth in real gdp in these five countries during the four years prior to the crisis  the red bar shows average growth in the worst two consecutive years after the onset of the crisis  the average stepdown in real gdp growth after these financial crises was about 5 percentage points  the
righthand side of the bar chart shows figures for the current episode in the united states  the blue bar shows average growth in the four years before 2007 the date used as the onset of the crisis  the red bar shows our projection for average growth in the worst two years following the onset 2008 and 2009  on this metric we are projecting a pattern similar to though not as severe as these other episodes  still we see the evidence from past financial crises as suggesting that the risks to activity are tilted to the downside
the bottom three panels highlight the alternative simulation in the greenbook that explores that possibility  as you know in the baseline forecast we anticipate that financial market strains will gradually wane over the next two years  in contrast in the more financial stress scenario we assume that risk premiums on a variety of securities move up significantly from their current levels and then come down more slowly than in the baseline  as shown to the left real gdp in this scenario contracts considerably in 2009 and increases only a little in 2010  the unemployment rate the middle panel peaks at 9 percent and core inflation the panel on the right moves below zero
the top panels of exhibit 8 examine the cyclical properties of labor productivity plotting the level around the staffs estimate of trend  as noted in the first bullet in the middle left panel in some earlier recessionssuch as those that started in 1973 and in 1981labor productivity was procyclical  that is labor productivity fell below trend during the recessionlikely reflecting some labor hoardingand then rose fairly quickly thereafter  during the 1990 recession this pattern was barely evident while it was not observed at all during the 2001 recession  in the current episode shown in the top right with a magnified scale we expect that labor productivity will exhibit a mild procyclical pattern  with this recession anticipated to be quite deep we expect many businesses to find that deeper job cuts would require shedding core personnel leading to some labor hoarding in the near term
later this year firms in recovering sectors expand production without initially adding to payrolls  accordingly job losses in the private sector continue in the second half and the unemployment rate the black line in the middle right panel rises further
given the additional nearterm weakness in our outlook for activity the unemployment rate now is expected to peak at 8 percent early next year a bit higher than in the last greenbook  this slack in resource utilization puts considerable downward pressure on inflation  in addition the sharp drop in energy prices the bottom left panel along with declines in import and commodity prices also restrains our forecast of core inflation  as shown to the right on line 3 in the table we project
that these factors will push core pce inflation down to 1 percent this year and to
08 percent next year  with the decline in energy prices total pce inflation line 1 dips a little below core this year but then rises a little above core next year as energy prices increase a bit
shifting gears exhibit 9 reprises material from the prefomc briefing that bob tetlow delivered yesterday it takes a closer look at an unconventional policy action included as an alternative simulation in the greenbook  as you know in our baseline scenario the zero lower bound constraint on the federal funds rate is binding until 2013  this constraint partly explains our pessimistic baseline forecasts for unemployment and inflation which are shown as the black lines in the panels at the top of the exhibit  we can demonstrate the implications of the lowerbound  constraint for the economic outlook using an unconstrained optimal control simulation much like the one you saw in the december bluebook which would prescribe lowering the funds rate to about negative 4 percent by the end of this year the effects of such a monetary policy if it were feasible are shown by the green lines in the panels  as you can see in the top left panel by 2011 the unemployment rate would be more than 1 percentage point below the baseline path and the top right panel shows that inflation would be  percentage point above baseline at that point
a largescale asset purchase programor lsap program for shortof mortgagebacked securities and longerterm treasury securities is one of a variety of the unconventional monetary policies that could in principle combat this problem the efficacy of such a program depends on several assumptions summarized in the middle left panel  first these assets must be imperfect substitutes for shortterm debtan assumption most economists would find reasonable otherwise actions intended to affect their returns could be undone through arbitrage with shortterm securities  second treasury bonds and mbs must remain good substitutes for other types of longterm debt as they are thought to be under normal conditions so that reductions in yields on the targeted securities spill over to other private interest rates third movements in longterm rates should ideally continue to favorably influence stock prices the exchange rate and other financial markets thereby boosting the programs stimulative effect  as noted in the middle right panel the lsap program we used for the alternative simulation assumes purchasing 500 billion in treasury securities as well as further purchases of 500 billion in agency mbs beyond those already announced  these purchases are assumed to be carried out over the next year and a half and are eventually unwound over 2012 and 2013  as indicated by the next set of bullets we assume that these purchases reduce various longterm interest rates
between 75 and 125 basis points over the next few months these estimated effects are consistent with the analysis in the notes completed in december that dealt with various zero lower bound issues  using these estimates the macroeconomic effects of the program are shown by the red lines in the panels at the top  according to the frbus model the unemployment rate follows a path only modestly above the theoretical unconstrained optimum and inflation is closer to the unconstrained trajectory  moreover the federal funds rate not shown rises above the lower bound at the beginning of 2012 one year earlier than in the baseline projection
the potential benefits of this particular lsap program notwithstanding some important caveats are laid out in the bottom panel  on the financial end the direct interest rate effects of the program are highly uncertain if only because we have so little experience with this sort of program  second the current dysfunction in some financial markets could limit the magnitude of indirect effectsthat is the spillovers into markets other than those in which purchase activity takes place  third the size of the program may be subject to economiesor diseconomiesof scale  fourth lsap programs and unconventional policies more generally introduce tricky exit issues regarding how to unwind the program without disrupting markets incurring large losses on the federal reserves portfolio or sparking a longerrun inflation problem  regarding macroeconomic issues with credit availability so constrained at the moment and uncertainty so high the model may understateor overstatethe size of the response of consumption and investment to changes in financial conditions of a given magnitude  in addition possible heavy reliance on mortgage rates and housing to drive economic recovery entails some risks particularly if spillovers from mortgage rates into other asset prices are limited  all told as this discussion makes clear some significant potential benefits and costs need to be weighed when considering the possible implementation of largescale asset purchase programs
trevor will now continue the presentation
mr reeve  as shown in the top left panel of your first international exhibit equity prices in the advanced foreign and emergingmarket economies have turned down over the past couple of weeks amid very gloomy economic indicators and intensified concerns about financial institutions  bank stock prices in the next panel have been especially hard hit  as trish and spence noted earlier strains in interbank funding markets have eased on balance since your last meeting despite deepening concerns about the banking sector  as shown in the middle left panel threemonth liborois spreads have continued their gradual descent  demand for dollar funding abroad appears to have eased following the turn of the year as evidenced by recent declines in outstanding draws from central bank liquidity swap facilities  with a good chunk of these swaps currently having an original maturity of three months it will take some time for these draws to roll off even if funding pressures ease further
in foreign exchange markets the bottom panels the dollar dropped sharply following the december cut in the federal funds rate target  but since that time as it has become increasingly clear that deteriorating conditions would lead foreign central banks also to ease policy further the dollar has reversed course and has appreciated slightly on net over the intermeeting period  as shown in the bottom right we continue to project a modest depreciation of the dollar over the next couple of years but this reverses only a little of the late2008 appreciation
the table at the top of your next exhibit summarizes our outlook for foreign growth  as shown on line 1 we estimate that total foreign gdp contracted at a pace of 3 percent in the fourth quarter the weakest quarterly reading in our thirtyeight year history of this series  we expect foreign output to fall sharply again in the
current quarter  these figures are considerably weaker than in the december projection as incoming data which we had expected to be grim nonetheless surprised us on the downside  we continue to project foreign gdp to stabilize toward the middle of the year and then to begin to recover as financial conditions gradually improve fiscal and monetary stimulus supports activity and the us economy regains its footing  of course there are downside risks to this view and data received in the past few days suggest that we may make additional downward revisions to our nearterm outlook  one of the most striking recent developments has been the very sharp drop in global manufacturing and international trade as shown by the plummeting purchasing managers indexes in the middle left panel  as manufacturing is procyclical steep declines in output and trade should be expected given the broader downturn  that said for many countries the recent movements have been breathtaking
the japanese economy has been particularly hard hit  as shown in the middle right panel real exports have plummeted with the decline in foreign demand and the appreciation of the yen  real household spending while far from a source of strength has held up better  as shown on line 4 of the table we estimate that japanese gdp contracted at a 5 percent pace in the fourth quarter and expect that gdp will keep shrinking until late this year  the euro area line 5 is not faring much better with gdp contracting at a 2 percent pace in the fourth and first quarters  as shown on the bottom left industrial production in the euro area as elsewhere has fallen sharply  retail sales have slumped but have not collapsed  the emerging asian economies line 9 are taking a severe beating with output contracting at a
6 percent pace in the fourth quarter amid widespread declines in exports  real gdp in korea and singapore not shown plunged 21 percent and 16 percent respectively and growth in china line 10 came to a standstill  as indicated in the bottom right panel continued strength in chinese retail sales has countered some of the weakness in external demand but growth in industrial production has fallen considerably  with chinese authorities taking strong measures to support the economy we see growth strengthening in the quarters ahead but remaining well below the 10 percent average over the past decade
the weakness in the us and foreign economies has shown through to us trade flows the subject of your next exhibit  as shown by the green line in the first panel our exports have dropped sharply  imports however have dropped even more leading to a marked narrowing of the trade deficit in november as indicated to the right  much of this narrowing is attributable to the value of oil imports which has plummeted with the fall in oil prices  as shown on the middle left imports have also been held down by the decline in motor vehicle sales which has led to a sharp slide in automotive imports  although we expect overall imports and exports to continue to fall in the current quarter as indicated by the dots the drop in exports is tempered somewhat by a projected rebound in aircraft exports  as shown in the middle right last autumns strike at boeing and subsequent production delays resulted in a notable drop in aircraft exports which should be reversed  as shown on line 1 of the table we estimate that real exports plummeted at a 20 percent pace in the fourth quarter a
much steeper rate of decline than previously projected and a very sharp reversal from the strong performance seen earlier in the year  our markdown to real import growth has been nearly as large resulting in a contribution of net exports to gdp line 3 that is down only about  percentage point in the fourth quarter from our december projection bringing it close to zero  we see trade continuing to contract in the current quarter but with the fall in imports exceeding that for exports the net contribution is projected to be positive  thereafter however the contribution of net exports turns negative
your next exhibit provides some historical context for this projection  as shown by the red line in the top panel the downturn in foreign growth that we anticipate is similar in magnitude to the 1982 and 2001 episodes but is somewhat more persistent as shown by the solid red bars in the middle panel exports subtracted about
1 percentage point from us gdp growth in 1982 and 2001  thus far in the current episode however the contribution of exports to gdp is less negative as the plunge  in exports at the end of last year followed robust growth in previous quarters  one key difference in the current recession is the real value of the dollar  as shown in the bottom panel the dollar was relatively strong and on an upward trajectory heading into the 1982 and 2001 downturns providing additional restraint to exports  leading into the recent period in contrast the dollar was notably weaker and thus provided a boost to exports  but with the dollar recently taking back some of its previous decline and with foreign demand remaining depressed exports are projected to decline again this year marking the first twoyear consecutive decline in 50 years
your next exhibit turns to commodity prices  as shown in the first panel oil and other commodity prices have plunged from their july peaks  these dramatic movements have led some observers to conclude that speculators played a key role in these price dynamics particularly for oil  evidence for this hypothesis however remains elusive  as shown in the top right the two main villains in this story noncommercial traders mainly hedge funds and index investors were reducing their exposure to crude oil over the first half of 2008 when oil prices were surging  over the past couple of months noncommercial traders have rebuilt their positions even as oil prices have continued to decline  moreover the pattern of observed inventories is not consistent with the speculation hypothesis  as shown in the middle left us crude oil inventories declined well below typical levels as prices were rising and hit a low right as the oil price peaked  since then inventories have moved up sharply reflecting the collapse in oil demand  as shown to the right the growth of world oil demand turned negative around the middle of last year  emergingmarket demand decelerated sharply late in the year leading to the biggest annual decline in global oil use since the early 1980s  in response to the downturn in demand opec has announced several production cuts in an effort to support prices  as indicated on the bottom left opec production the red line moved lower in the second half of last year and will fall considerably further if the cartel complies with its january target
these production cuts are unlikely to lead to a quick turnaround in oil prices given the large shock to demand  but over time as shown on the bottom right lower production along with firming demand should contribute to higher oil prices as
reflected in futures market quotes and our projections  nonfuel commodity prices are also expected to move up going forward albeit more slowly than oil prices
commodity price fluctuations have been a key driver of broader price movements  as shown in the top left panel of your next exhibit we project consumer price inflation in the advanced foreign economies to continue to drop sharply from elevated levels largely reflecting swings in food and energy prices although increasing slack also plays a role  as shown in the middle left inflation excluding food and energy in the advanced foreign economies has moved in a much narrower range  at this point the risks of a prolonged period of deflation appear small for these economies with japan being the clear exception  as shown below the central banks of the advanced foreign economies have cut policy rates sharply in recent months and we expect a little additional easing going forward  inflationary pressures have also diminished sharply for the emerging asian economies as shown in the middle right  for latin america however inflation has remained elevated partly as a result of currency depreciation  consequently monetary authorities have been reluctant to ease policy while inflation concerns persist  within the past two weeks however both brazil and mexico have begun to lower policy rates and we expect additional easing in the coming months  brian will now continue our presentation
mr madigan3   i will be referring to the separate package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections  exhibit 1 depicts the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2009 to 2011 and over the longer run following the integrated approach to the inclusion of longerrun projections that was recommended by the subcommittee on communications and discussed at the december fomc meeting  the likely severity of the current recession is clearly evident in this exhibit  nearly all of you expect real gdp to shrink this year the unemployment rate to climb to at least 8 percent by the fourth quarter and total pce inflation to be less than 1 percent on a fourthquarter over fourthquarter basis  this figure also highlights your expectations that a period of three years is likely to be insufficient for the economy to return to a balancedgrowth path following the current economic shock  indeed although the benchmark horizon for the longerrun projections was specified as about five to six years several of you noted that the convergence process might well take even longer than that

exhibit 2 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections corresponding information about the committees previous projectionsthose from last octoberis indicated in italics and greenbook projections are included as a memo item  as shown in the left column of the top panel your forecasts for real gdp growth in 2009 have a central tendency of minus 1 to minus  percent as most of you expect output to contract further during the first half of this yearat an annual rate of about 3 to 4 percentbefore resuming positive growth albeit at a low rate during the second half  moreover you generally anticipate a relatively sluggish recovery that reflects the gradual waning of financial stresses continued weakness in the housing sector and poor growth prospects abroad  as a result most of you see

3  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3
gdp growth as only gradually reaching a faster pace that eventually brings the economy back to its balancedgrowth path  nearly all of you estimate that real gdp will grow over the longer run the righthand column at an annual rate of 2 to
2 percent  the central tendency of these longerrun growth projections is the same as for the trial run that was conducted last october
as shown in the second panel your forecasts of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 fall in a range of 8 to 9 percent more than a percentage point higher than for the projections that you made last october  in explaining these revisions to your nearterm outlook many of you pointed to the weakness of incoming data on consumer spending and labor market conditions and to the rapid slowdown in global economic activity  your unemployment projections further ahead also underscore the anticipated slow pace of recovery  most of you expect that even in 2011 the unemployment rate will be about 6 to 7 percent well above your estimates of about 4 to 5 percent for the unemployment rate that will prevail over the longer run in the absence of further shocks  your longerrun projections for the unemployment rate have the same central tendency as in october
your forecasts for inflation in 2009 have also shifted markedly since last october your forecasts for overall pce inflation in 2009 the first column of the third panel now have a central tendency of 03 to 1 percent a full percentage point lower than the central tendency of your october projections and most of you now expect a core pce inflation rate of about 1 percent this year the first column of the bottom panel compared with the central tendency of 1 to 2 percent for your october projections
looking further ahead the width of the central tendencies and ranges of your inflation projections has increased considerably  for example the range of your overall pce inflation projections for 2011 spans an interval of nearly 2 percentage pointsabout twice as wide as the range of your projections last october  from your accompanying narratives it is evident that these differences reflect the diversity of your views about the pace of economic recovery the sensitivity of inflation to economic activity the prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidity and the degree to which you see longerrun inflation expectations as likely to remain firmly anchored over the next several years  many of you anticipate that inflation in 2011 will still be well below your individual assessments of the mandateconsistent inflation ratethat is the longerrun rate of inflation that each of you sees as most consistent with the federal reserves dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum employment  your assessments of the mandateconsistent inflation rate have a central tendency of about 1 to 2 percent and a range of 1 to 2 percent  this central tendency is noticeably higher than in october at that time your assessments were tightly clustered around a value of 1 percent whereas 2 percent is now the median and the mode of the distribution
in your forecast submissions many of you indicated that your views regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy are roughly similar to those of the greenbook which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain close to the zero bound through
late 2012  however a number of you noted that policy tightening would commence somewhat sooner than that and a couple of you expressed the view that the federal funds rate will need to be raised substantially above current levels during the second half of this year
exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  as shown in the top lefthand panel all of you see uncertainty about growth as elevated relative to historical norms and as shown to the right most of you continue to perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside even with the downward revision in your modal projections  in the accompanying narratives many of you emphasized the uncertainties in gauging the evolution and implications of the global financial turmoil the effects of nontraditional monetary policy tools and the size and effect of the fiscal stimulus package
as shown in the bottom lefthand panel nearly all of you see an elevated degree of uncertainty about the inflation outlook  as shown to the right a majority view the risks to that outlook as roughly balanced whereas the rest of you see the risks as  tilted to the downside  some of you noted that the degree of uncertainty about the inflation outlook reflects uncertainty about the evolution of resource slack and the path of commodity prices which are highly sensitive to global economic conditions others mentioned that the risks to the inflation outlook could eventually become tilted to the upside if stimulative policy measures are not unwound in a timely fashion once the economy begins to recover
as you know your agenda reserves time for a decision tomorrow as to whether to proceed with regular publication of longerrun projections  you may wish to indicate your general views on that issue in the economic goround  as usual the staff will be preparing a summary of economic projections sep and will be circulating drafts to you over the next few weeks along with drafts of the minutes  should you decide to proceed with longerterm projections these projections from this cycle would be included in the sep to be released along with the minutes of this meeting in mid february  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  do we have questions for the staff  president
plosser
mr plosser  i have a few questions two really short onesjust clarifying onesand
two longer ones  on the presentation i have a question on exhibit 7 the recovery across
different recessions  i note that you say you started it at the second quarter of 08 as being the
trough  everything else starts that at the nber trough which would have been the fourth
quarter of 07  why did you do that and not do it elsewhere  is there any reason for it
mr sichel  you could do these types of cyclical comparison charts either way dating
from the nber peak or dating from the seriesspecific peak  what is done here is to index to the
seriesspecific peak so that you look at each of the path cycles and say when gdp turned down
in that cycle  in many cycles that is the same as the nber peak but in some cycles it is not  in
this cycle in particular it came a couple of quarters later  you could do it the other wayin
which case you would see the red line rising first and then coming down  it is just a different
way of presenting the same information
mr plosser  i was just curious what the rationale for using that peak in some cases
but in other parts of the presentation you used the fourth quarter
mr sichel  arguably it really just comes down to that it is a different way of
presenting the same information  you get a cleaner comparison because every business cycle
has some unique features and the timing differs in some particular ways  this is trying to
abstract from those differences in timing  but one could do it the other way
mr plosser  the second clarifying questionim curious about tightening standards
on consumer loans particularly credit cards in exhibit 4  when you asked a banker in the
survey about tightening credit card lending how am i supposed to interpret that  does that
mean that they have reduced physically or technically the credit limits on credit cards  does it
mean that they are offering fewer credit cards
ms dynan  brian can correct me if i am wrong but i believe it is more the latter
offering fewer credit cards
mr plosser  it has been great that i get much fewer requests to apply for credit
cards  laughter
ms dynan  we have asked separately about what they are doing to credit lines  in
fact more than half are saying that they are reducing credit lines as well
mr plosser  i guess the issue there for me is if they are reducing excess credit
linesfor example on credit cards that were not being exercised anywayor just not offering
as many cards how i interpret that in terms of really tightening credit is a bit loose there
compared with some other things  so i just wanted some clarification
now i have two moresubstantive questions  first about inflation forecasting  the best
way i can describe forecasting in this environment is guesswork and certainly my staff and i
have struggled with the inflation forecast  in a lot of models the approach to inflation
forecasting both depends on and is very sensitive to varying degrees of incorporating forward
looking expectations and how much looking backward you do  in this environment when you
have big swings up and down in inflation looking backward may or may not be very helpful or
very good  it also depends a lot on how much credibility you think the central bank has  it is
further complicated because we are at the zero bound and that is difficult to incorporate into the
models  so i would like a little discussion from you about how you came up with your forecast
for inflation in this modelhow much of the path that you got is really dependent on the model
because frankly it is really hard to figure out what to do given all those things i just mentioned
mr sichel  so i share your pain  laughter  regarding how we put this together we
are not looking at any particular model  we are looking at a range of models and trying to make
the best judgment that we can about how the various forces that affect inflation are likely to
come into play over the next couple of years  in terms of frameworks we look at some pretty
standard backwardlooking models that do not have any forwardlooking components just
traditional measures of resource slack  we also look at some forwardlooking models in which
we incorporate various measures of inflation expectations to try to avail ourselves of the
information in some of the surveybased measures of inflation expectations that have a more
forward looking component
in terms of the factors that are particularly important for this contour the very large
amount of resource slack shown in that picture as captured by the unemployment ratealthough
one could measure that in many waysis one important feature in the considerable slowdown of
inflation  we think that a lot of slack will be putting downward pressure on wages and prices
then we add to that the movements in energy and other commodities and materials prices and
the movements in import prices which have all been quite dramatic recently in the direction of
pushing inflation down  we think that all those things in terms of the forwardlooking
component are also going to be weighing on inflation expectations and that as businesses and
households in the economy see all of those factors and see headline inflation numbers coming
down inflation expectations themselves will be coming down some  so we do the best we can
with a range of models and try to bring the best judgment we can and this is where we land
mr plosser  okay  i think it is very difficult
mr stockton  the thing that we are having the greatest difficulty with is trying to
think about the evolution of inflation expectations in this current environment in which
monetary policy has the fed funds rate pinned at zero and that shows through in other places  in
this forecast we are assuming that because actual inflation is going to run as low as it is for the
reasons that dan said there will be some downdrift in inflation expectations  that is implicit in
this forecast maybe on the order of  percentage point over the next few years  we are
uncertain enough about that that we obviously wanted to show some alternative simulations
because a reasonable case could be made that in fact we are not going to get as much downdrift
in inflation expectations as we have implicitly built into this forecast  we showed a simulation
with anchored expectations running at about 2 percent and i could see that  even though we
have already entered a period of extreme weakness as we showed in the briefing yesterday the
michigan survey with 5to10yearahead inflation expectations has not really shown any
discernible movement yet  we might have expected that we would already have seen that if the
effect was going to be large
on the other hand just taking a look at historical evidence on sacrifice ratios would
suggest a great deal more disinflation than we have built into this forecast  if you just used
average sacrifice ratios of 4 you would come up with something similar to what we had in the
deflation scenario that we showed  though i am skeptical about that particular sort of pure
backwardlooking model i do not think you could write off the possibility that given that we
think we are going to be in an extended period of extreme weakness with large output gaps and
declining price pressures coming from commodities and oil you could see a more significant
movement in inflation expectations and even lower inflation  so we are struggling with all of the
exact issues that you laid out  this is our best guess at this point
mr plosser  so just two observations about that  one is that we spent a lot of the
past year as we had the runup in headline inflation due to oil on the upside and most of us
stressed the importance of anchored expectations and believed that expectations remained fairly
well anchored  consistent with that ongoing view my outlook looked more like your anchored
inflation expectations framework  i guess id also just comment that a lot of the empirical
evidence on let me call it the newkeynesian phillips curves with output gaps suggests that the
sensitivity of inflation to some of those gap measures is certainly not as large as the sacrifice
ratio of 4 that you would put in  so i think there might be reason to diminish that effect
particularly if you thought as we have discussed before that some of these shocks might in fact
be shocks where you actually have a new lower equilibrium  so the gap is maybe not as large as
it appears to be
mr stockton  just to be clear  in our forecast we are assuming a much flatter
phillips curve than has been the traditionally estimated one and a higher sacrifice ratio
mr plosser  my last question is about fiscal stimulus and your estimates there  it is
hard not to read the commentary and there is a huge debate going on about the effects of
stimulus  look at the empirical evidence the theoretical evidencethe empirical work by
blanchard and valerie rameys stuff and you have christina romers work on the different
estimates of multipliers and all that sort of stuff  and i was curious  in the discussion you
highlighted two pieces in particular  the first was the consumer tax cut and the debates about
whether or not that is going to be saved or spent and the second one which i thought was
somewhat more interesting was that you thought that the business tax cuts would not have much
effect  i guess i had two questions about that  one my reading of the empirical evidence is that
those business tax cuts often do have some very short run stimulative effects but the empirical
evidence also says that large spending increases oftentimes have a negative effect on business
investment  that is where the substitution comes from  so i just would like a little insight in
terms of the model or the assessment of the pieces of this stimulus and how it plays into what
youre assuming about some of those multipliers and so forth
mr sichel  to pick up on the business side of that firstwe looked at the experience
from the 200204 business tax cuts and our best reading of that was that we just did not see
much effect  in terms of the empirical work that we did we just dont think that there is a big
kick there perhaps particularly in a period when many businesses are in tough times and taking
losses  it just may not be enough or the right kind of thing to get them to start investing  so our
reading of the evidence is that on the business side there just will not be much
mr plosser  if that is true it would suggest that the other relevant piece of evidence
for this is that if large increases in expenditures as opposed to tax cuts act as a negative on
business investment as some of the empirical evidence suggests your forecast for business
investment may be worse than what you have in your modelor not
mr sichel  i guess that channel would come through a usercost effect on large
expenditures and so on pushing up interest rates and generating crowdingout through that sort of
a channel  we do have a modest increase in treasury rates in this forecast for a variety of
reasons but we also have quite a dramatic decrease in say baa bond rates and those spreads
coming in during this period when we think as the macro risk diminishes we are going to see
some declines in credit spreads  i think that decline in credit spreads going forward is likely to
more than offset whatever forces there might be from the kind of expenditurebased crowding
out
on the household side we are looking at the proposed tax cuts as being permanent  we
are treating them as permanent tax cuts so we are treating those the way that we would typically
treat a change in income in the usual model  we have a marginal propensity to consume of
about 07  we have some lags by which about 60 percent of the spending that is going to happen
happens in the first year and about 85 percent by the end of the second year and we are doing a
pretty standard sort of analysis there with the types of numbers that we are getting
mr plosser  well the key is that you were treating them as permanent
mr sichel  yes
mr plosser  that answers the question there
mr sichel  we are interpreting this proposal as a down payment on a permanent
change
mr plosser  okay  thank you
chairman bernanke  other questions for the staff  president bullard
mr bullard  i am comparing exhibit 3 with exhibit 6 here  in exhibit 3 you have
the middle panel on the right overvaluation of singlefamily homes and in exhibit 6 the
middle right panel you have prices of commercial properties  on exhibit 3 i guess this is a
judgment call  a reduction in home values of about 25 percentam i reading this rightfrom
where they are now
ms dynan  you have to remember that rents are also rising in this calculation  but
just in terms of the price component we have seen a decline of about 15 percent so far and we
are going to see another 15 percent
mr bullard  another 15 percent on homes
ms dynan  that is right
mr bullard  so i have done pictures like this too because i think it shows that the
bubble part is out and whatever else is remaining is overreaction which is what you are saying
ms dynan  that is consistent with our view yes
mr bullard  but on commercial properties and then in exhibit 6 you have maybe a
different story a more moderated downturn there if i am reading this right
ms dynan  yes
mr bullard  is there a reason that we should think commercial properties are not as
susceptible to the overcorrection as housing is
ms dynan  we do not have a modelor we have not really found a robust model
for overvaluation of commercial property so it has been more difficult to analyze formally  but
more generally the reason we think that there will be such a large overcorrection on the
residential side is that with our forecast for the huge numbers of foreclosures we think we are
going to see a lot of supply dumped on the market and that it will perhaps lead sellers to
aggressively cut prices  so far that has not happened in the commercial area although we
certainly think it is a risk  we agree with president yellens view that depending on what
happens in the cmbs market it could be something that would happen  but your reading is
correctwe are not foreseeing a massive overcorrection on the commercial side at this point
mr bullard  okay  i guess i will interpret that as there might be some downside
risk in this area
ms dynan  for sure
mr bullard  on the assessment of fiscal policy what is the effect of the deficit
program on longerterm treasury rates
mr stockton  that is a hard question to answer with any precision but here goes
we have implicit in this forecast a rise in the ratio of federal debt to gdp of about 15 percentage
points over the next two or three years  you may recall that there was a whole cottage industry
several years ago trying to estimate the effects on longterm interest rates of that  one study
done by glenn hubbard and eric engen one done by thomas laubach and im forgetting the
third one now but they all came up with effects  some were in the range of 2 to 3 basis points
per percentage point  if you used those estimates to get a rough idea of how much you might be
holding up treasury yields from what they otherwise would be you would get something
between  and  percentage point  i am not really sure in the current circumstances how
relevant some of that empirical evidence is in that we dont think we are going to be in a
situation where there will as dan noted be very much crowdingout because the output gap is so
large over this period  it is not quite as though the federal government is going to be competing
with the private sector for the resources  there are going to be a lot of slack resources available
in our estimate of the output gap
mr bullard  is that a global output gap or just the united states
mr stockton  just the united states  i am not sure whether i would venture a guess
as high as the upper end of that range but clearly we are starting to hear some stories about
treasury yields being affected by anticipation of a very significant rise in debt here
mr bullard  okay  i just have one more thing  it is exhibit 9 which is an
unconventional policy  we have two graphs at the top on the unemployment rate and core
pce prices  i guess i would interpret these to say that if you were serious about putting
confidence bounds around these estimates you probably could not tell these apart statistically
do you think that is a fair assessment or are they more tightly estimated than that
mr sichel  if you look at the picture in part 1 of the greenbook we have some
confidence bands based on greenbook errors  if you compare the largescale asset purchases
line in that picture with the baseline the largescale asset purchases line is near the edge of the
70 percent confidence interval  so they are different  laughter  it is important to acknowledge
that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty particularly in thinking about these types of
programs and the effect of these types of programs  if you think about all the steps as you go
through the exercise of trying to gauge what the effect of these programs is and you go through
all the steps of the purchase of securitieswhat is the effect on interest rates in the market where
the securities are purchased what is the spillover to other markets and then in this environment
what are the implications for economic outcomesthere are many places to be very uncertain
mr bullard  so there is a lot of additional uncertainty that may not be properly
captured in those confidence bounds  is that what you are saying
mr sichel  well the confidence bounds are based on a draw of errors over the past
20plus years  that may not correctly capture the environment that we are in now
mr stockton  i think we can safely say that the confidence intervals are wide here
i think wider than we show in those estimates probably wider than you can get on a legal size
piece of paper  laughter  we start out with our normal simulations that have all of the
uncertainty about the shocks to the economy and even about the structure of the model of the
economy  these simulations have the tremendous added uncertainty of what these purchase
programs will actually do to private interest rates and as the note that was circulated to the
committee indicated there is just a lot of uncertainty about how any particular program would
affect mortgage rates treasury rates the baa rate  we are doing our best here  in some sense
this was a response to a question that you posed last time  what would it take to fill the gap
between the unconstrained and the baseline forecasts  but i think it is extremely uncertain
mr bullard  we didnt get lines that went like this or where it would have a huge
effect but it would be very bad for other elements of the economy or something like that  we did
not really get that  we got things that are close to baseline
chairman bernanke  we are doing bayesian decision analysis and not classical
hypothesis testing here  that is a very different proposition  president lockhart
mr lockhart  i decided to withdraw my question
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  i want to get back to commercial real estate for a second  as i recall we
had a very significant correction in commercial real estate in the late 80s early 90s  i wonder
if you have looked at what you are anticipating for the next couple of years relative to that
experience and whether it was similar more severe less severe or whatever
ms dynan  actually at this point the rise in delinquency rates is
mr stern  you are going to get some help from steve
ms dynan  thank you
mr oliner  i am just going to add a few words  i think we are expecting problems in
that sector that will not be as severe as the downturn in the late 80s and the early 90s in large
part because we did not have the massive amount of overbuilding in this cycle that we had then
it is true that we have had a tremendous drop in demand for space but we are coming into this
cycle in a much better supply position
mr stern  okay  thanks  the second question  did you calculate an implicit fiscal
multiplier for the next couple of years  if so what is it
mr sichel  we did  those numbers are hard to interpret but we did a calculation
mr plosser  i tried to get an answer on that and they would not give it  maybe they
will answer it for you
mr sichel  in the sorts of calculations we talked about of figuring out what the
impulse is we have a multiplier of about 13
mr stern  one point three
mr sichel  yes  if you compare that with others though it is very important to be
careful because those multiplier calculations include all sorts of different things  what are you
assuming is endogenous or exogenous  what other things move and when you do that
calculation what of those things that move are you including or not including  so we think that
is very much in the range of the numbers that other analysts looking at this type of program are
using  we do not think we are doing anything particularly different there  you might see a
number that looks different but if you dig under the surface and you do an applestoapples
comparison i think we are very much in the range of what others are doing there
mr stern  okay  thanks
chairman bernanke  it depends on the composition of the programs too
mr sichel  absolutely
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  real quick a domestic question and an international question  the
domestic question which is just a data question  what do we expect the treasury issuance to be
in fiscal year 2009  the numbers i have seen go up to 2 trillion
mr sichel  we are projecting a deficit for fiscal 2009 of about 18 trillion
mr fisher  but my question is new issuance
mr sichel  i do not have those numbers
mr stockton  we have an answer to that question but i do not have it right in front
of me
mr fisher  could you get it to me sometime
mr stockton  absolutely
mr fisher  on the international sidemaybe this is a question for nathani am
curious  as i understand it the exchequer has given the bank of england permission to
purchase outright highquality corporate bonds  i presume that they have had the same kind of
discussion that we have had about moral hazard how far they want to go which securities they
wish to purchase and so on  i was thinking about that looking at this table in exhibit 11 and the
united kingdoms predicament but do you know who has some insight into that decision and
how perverse or how wise it is
mr sheets  i think it is fair to say that of the major central banks the bank of
england has been particularly concerned about the moral hazard sorts of issues and has moved
into these kinds of programs with great reluctance  the major feature that i see of this
announcement by the bank of england is that now they can purchase outright stuff that they
were taking only as collateral  my understanding is that this program is limited to aaarated
assets and i dont see them taking on as a result of this a huge amount or really any credit risk
under their balance sheet  so i interpreted this as a relative modest step down the road toward
balance sheet expansion  thats my reading of it  we can look at it again more carefully and see
if we have different views at that point
the uk program more generally had some really aggressive features that didnt involve
the bank of england  for instance the government is now going to be guaranteeing the asset
side of the balance sheet as well as the liabilities side of the balance sheet for institutions and
those sorts of things that were part of the announcement  but i saw the bank of england step as
more incremental rather than some sort of significant quantum shift in the orientation of their
policy
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  other questions  president lacker
mr lacker  im looking at exhibit 9  i note that the program involved half mbs
half treasury and that mortgage rates fell 125 basis points and baa rates fell 75  what if it was
all treasury  what would the fall in mortgage rates be and what would the fall in the baa rates
be  would the effect on growth be larger or smaller
mr sichel  i can tell you a little about that  we did unpack the simulation and think
about what if it was just 500 billion in mbs  what does that look like  what if it was just
500 billion in treasuries  what does that look like  it is very important to highlight the
uncertainties that dave stockton just mentioned with these estimates being incredibly uncertain
we are trying to do something consistent with what was in those zero lower bound notes but
boy there is a lot of tough stuff going on  so when we do that and we think about a 500 billion
treasury package we would see treasuries coming down about 50 basis points and baa yields
and mortgage rates coming down about 30 basis points  the assumption there is that you get a
hit on treasuries and then a somewhat smaller spillover into other markets
mr lacker  did you say 30 for both mortgage rates and baa
mr sichel  yes and there is no great science here  it is looking at correlations of
rates and how these rates have moved historically and so on  if you look just at mbs you find
that you would get a bigger effect on mortgage rates maybe something on the order of 90 basis
points on mortgage rates 50 on baa and maybe 30 on treasuries  then when we take all of that
and we run it through frbus and think about 500 billion of this and 500 billion of that what
are the output effects  in frbus the output effects are pretty similar for those two programs
now there are many channels through which these programs would affect the economy that are
not captured in frbus  one could make very plausible arguments for why in fact those two
effects might not be the same so let me just leave it there
mr lacker  when you say same you mean at the aggregate level
mr sichel  at the aggregate level right
mr lacker  presumably the fraction that is houses is different
mr sichel  oh yes  but if you look at what the change is in the unemployment rate
relative to the baseline it is about the same
mr lacker  the composition is different
mr sichel  right the composition is different
mr lacker  so this implies that if you did 1 trillion in treasuries the baa rate
would be lower
mr sichel  what is the comparison that you are doing
vice chairman dudley  he is multiplying by two
mr sichel  yes and then comparing it is lower than what
mr lacker  i guess the 75  i guess i am confused  i seethe treasuries have a
smaller overall multiplier  it is like 30  so it would be just 30  so it would just be 60 on that
and 60 on the
mr sichel  these numbers are very rough  i feel like i am being tortured giving
these out here  laughter  they are very rough
mr lacker  two more questions  one for brian  in exhibit 6 the projections
bottom panel longerrun inflation forecast the dotted line is our october projections and the
solid lines are our january projections  if our intent was to find an inflation number that we all
report that had some stability from forecast to forecast we seem to have failed
mr madigan  well it could be that the committees views have changed in the last
several months
vice chairman dudley  you mean for example where you want to anchor long
term inflation expectations
mr madigan  exactly
mr lacker  so one interpretation is that the implicit longerrun inflation objective of
the committee has changed over this quarter
mr madigan  and one plausible reason for that is that the committee is now
experiencing the actuality of a very large negative demand shock and maybe it now believes that
it needs a larger inflation buffer than it previously thought would be best
mr lacker  but this exact variability is what led us to be unhappy with the third year
of the forecast mechanism for revealing an implicit inflation target
chairman bernanke  it could go the other way  you could say that the trouble
with the fixed target is that it doesnt allow for knowledge to accumulate  i mean there really
has been another deflation scare and it may affect our views
mr lacker  okay  well well discuss this more  one final thing  i think i saw
governor duke try to intervene during the conversation about the responses to the senior loan
officer opinion survey which was something i was discussing with governor kohn a minute
ago  you know when i think about what people say about credit constraints the idea of a
consumer with given characteristicsfico score income and everythingwith gdp growth
of plus 3 versus gdp growth of minus 5 the identical consumer is going to be riskier in the
second situation  if a bank is not willing to lend in the second situation and is willing to lend in
the first situation i assert that they would say they are tightening their standards  i would also
assert that it does not seem like a creditchannel creditconstraint type of thing as you might
otherwise think
chairman bernanke  it would be interesting to compare the senior loan officer
opinion survey over different cycles for example
mr lacker  right it would but i was going to ask governor duke because she is
probably actually
ms duke  i will speak for myself  when bankers talk about credit terms that is
typically going to be something like the credit score the debttoincome ratio or some metric of
underwriting with the most obvious example being gmacs announcement right after becoming
a bank holding company that they were going to reduce their minimum credit score from
somewhere in the low 700s to somewhere in the mid600s which would obviously mean that
they would approve a larger number of applications  sometimes a change in terms is done to
reduce the number of accounts or the volume sometimes its done to increase the quality
a couple of things are going on  right now you have the same consumers credit metrics
deteriorating very rapidly  so even if you did not change the metrics you were using you would
still approve a much smaller proportion of the applications  so that is going on  the other thing
i will be interested to see the next time we do this survey is that the banks are feeling a
tremendous amount of political pressure on their lending  i am not sure that they want to report
that they have tightened their terms for consumer lending or even particularly that they are going
to change those terms  so i think we might see some pretty drastic reports of at least not
tightening terms on consumer lending in the next survey
mr lacker  thank you
chairman bernanke  seeing no other questions why dont we adjourn for today
and we will begin tomorrow the first thing900 amwith the goround  there is a reception
across the way and dinner
meeting recessed
january 28 2009morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  on the announcement of the
extension of our various programs we have had additional communication with the european
central bank and they are well disposed toward extending the swap arrangement  but it turns
out that they need a few more days to get formal approval from the governing council  their
proposal is that we announce next tuesday morning so that they can get the approval on
monday  we have had some discussions about communication strategy and the view appears to
be that putting all of our programs in one announcement is probably the best way to go because
otherwise you create questions about why this and not that  so although it puts some pressure on
our confidentiality and all the other things i think the planand i would be happy to take
comments or advicewould be to hold off until next tuesday morning to announce both the
swap extensions and the credit programs that we voted on yesterday
president plosser we did inquire about the amlf and had some discussionstalked
with president rosengren and his staff  the view is that there are some complications and
difficulties with ending it in a peremptory way  we will continue to discuss that but we think
for the moment we should not cancel it immediately  president rosengren would you like to
comment on that
mr rosengren  yes  as i said yesterday i talked to the money market funds
they do think that the backup facility while they hope they dont have to use it has been serving
a different purpose from some of the other facilities  there is some concern that if we were to
announce the closure we would get inundated with assetbacked commercial paper right before
we closed down the facility  and the money market funds would have to do other things to try to
remain more liquid so we might create issues that we are not trying to create at this time  so i
would be in favor of extending it
chairman bernanke  with the understanding that we will continue to look at all
these programs and review them and that we always have the option to restructure and
rationalize what we do  any thoughts or comments on the communication issue  all right  if
not it is time for the economic goround and we will start with president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  in atlanta we just completed a full cycle
of our branch board meetings and the atlanta board discussions as well as quite a number of
prefomc calls  no surprise sentiment about the economy continues to worsen as more parties
are feeling the effect of the downturn  fallout from financial market stress and the contracting
economy continues to spread and is affecting sectors previously thought to be insulatedfor
example hospitals and universities  consumer retrenchment has significantly affected
restaurants the travel industry and a wide variety of personal services  the anecdotes i am
hearing on consumer behavior are quite colorful  describing the popular culture one director
said it is cool not to spend  a director who is a chief financial officer of a large national
homeimprovement retailer described the recent shifts in consumer purchases within their stores
in the direction of paint if i am out of work i might as well paint those walls snow blowers no
longer willing to pay for service in the snow belt and zeroradius lawnmowers not to mow
ones lawn but to hire oneself out to mow others lawns  anecdotal feedback also supports the
greenbook view that house prices continue to feel downward pressure  in some parts of the
sixth districtfor example south florida and metro atlantai am advised that prices may yet
decline another 10 to 20 percent over the year
there is widespread frustration over the inability to make longerterm plans in such a
highly uncertain environment  this seems the case across the spectrum of economic actors
including banks large and smaller businesses and households  investment decisions are being
indefinitely postponed  we are hearing from business and consumer borrowers that they cant
get loans or that lending terms for new or existing loans have tightened to an extent that they
perceive as unreasonable  bankers are telling me that there is little loan demand from qualified
borrowers  our sr examiners noted a migration to assetcollateralized secured loan structures
for previously unsecured cash flowbased ci loans
prompted by the question that we sent out in advance much of the discussion at our
recent board meeting centered on fed communication strategy and execution  atlanta directors
were uniform in their call for intensified and simplified communication aimed at the general
public to treat confusion anxiety and a deficit of confidence  saying much the same thing
financial market contacts emphasized the heightened importance at this time of a clear and
credible framework and plan for improving financial conditions and the avoidance of the
appearance of oneoff emergency policies  this theme reflects a context of deep concerns about
the financial sector in general and some very large institutions in particular
turning to the national economy and my forecast the broad strokes of my forecast
havent changed materially since october  then i was on balance rather pessimistic and i
remain skeptical of a more vshaped recovery developing in the second half of 2009 and 2010
as projected in the greenbook  now i acknowledge that the greenbook narrative used the
words gradually strengthening but it did depict 2 percent growth in the second half and
2 percent next year  in contrast i continue to anticipate a flatter more protracted lshaped
recovery moving through 2011  it is my sense that the rebuildingor rearchitecting to use
governor warshs termof the financial system and the rebuilding of business and household
balance sheets will take a long time restraining growth in the process
similar to the more financial stress alternative scenario i think the dysfunction in the
ordinary channels of credit intermediation is likely to linger and as in the more cautious
spending alternative i think rates of business and household saving could rise significantly and
remain elevated after the recovery takes hold  one wall street firm calls this their frugal future
hypothesis  one of my financial contacts argued that the context of any recovery would be one
of working through structural issues that are deep and wide  the referenced structural issues
include the balance of saving versus consumption with the obvious implication for consumer
demand
the potential for a longer period of moreintractable disinflation could obviously
complicate progress toward recovery and this possibility weighs heavily on my assessment of
the risks we face  also i find it hard to think of an appropriate policy that anticipates core
pce inflation remaining under 1 percent through 2013 as in the greenbook forecast  again of
course the greenbook forecast is not conditioned on appropriate policy  i have therefore
conditioned my assumption about the path of policy on adequately addressing the risk of further
unwelcome disinflation that threatens deflation  my longerrun outlook assuming no further
adverse shocks has inflation returning to a 2 percent trend and my growth projection converging
to a 2 percent potential  let me add that i support the subcommittees proposal on the long
term forecast  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman since the last fomc meeting our districts economy has
continued to weaken and this weakness is widespread and is taking on more of the complexion
of the national economy  led by a sharp decline in manufacturing and slower export growth
yearoveryear private employment growth slipped into negative territory in november for the
first time in our region since 04  consumer spending weakened in december despite heavy
discounting and residential real estate activity remains quite depressed  conditions in
commercial real estate have deteriorated markedly and financing in this sector has become
extremely difficult  i might add a footnote here  in discussions of this with some of the folks
involved in commercial real estate they are concerned about a couple of years from now because
in 2002 2003 and 2004 there were a lot of commercial real estate projects put into play at very
low cap rates and very good interest rates with a 10year balloon  so those are all turning now
with obviously less value because they are assuming that the cap rates will be higher  they are
also assuming that the buildings will not be as new and therefore the values will be under
pressure  so they feel that the problems in commercial real estate are only beginning
those parts of the district that depend on energy and agriculture continue to be
somewhat better but these areas are expected to showand are in fact showingdeclines and
we expect pretty sharp declines in 09 due to the falloff in commodity prices  district businesses
are moving rapidly to address the sharp slowdown  many have instituted hiring and wage
freezes and layoffs have risen considerably  many businesses have significantly curtailed
current production and future capital spending plans  for example our energy industry contacts
expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction in drilling activity and a 35 to 60 percent reduction in capital
expenditures in 09
the fiscal situation for states and local governments has also deteriorated very rapidly
most district states are now looking at significant budget shortfalls over the next two years
most states plan to address these deficits through spending reductions rather than tax increases
the situation for local governments is somewhat mixed depending on whether they rely on
property taxes or on sales taxes for the revenue base  many states and localities are looking for
assistance from the federal stimulus package to avoid more draconian cutbacks in spending
banking conditions are deteriorating within the region  nonperforming loans are increasing and
losses are mounting as well
turning to the national economy recent economic data have been worse than expected
leading me like others to revise down the forecast for growth this year  i now think we could
see negative growth into the third quarter before the economy picks up as the fiscal stimulus
begins to take hold later  in the near term i see considerable downside risk to growth due to the
pervasive weakness in the us and foreign economies and the substantial financial headwinds
that remain in place  indeed i fully expect banking conditions to deteriorate further even as
financial markets begin to stabilize  i am especially concerned that commercial real estate as i
mentioned earlier could be the next shoe to drop with broad implications for banks and
insurance companies across the country  consequently the strength and the timing of the
recovery appear obviously very uncertain at this point
in terms of inflation the significant decline in energy and commodity prices along with a
weaker economy has obviously put considerable downward pressure on overall and core
inflation as a cyclical effect of this recession  i think it would not necessarily be timely to start
projecting deflationary pressures and although i get more questions about that at this point i
dont consider that the highest risk we have  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  like everybodys district our district has
slowed and continues to look very weak  the business outlook survey actually rose a little last
month but it is still measured deeply in recessionary territory  our banks continue to lendto
households in particular  they have cut back on commercial lending and credit quality
continues to deteriorate across all loan categories in the district  housing sales are down but
prices have not fallen to the degree that they have in some parts of the country probably on
averagethe declines have been more modest  and the housing problems are not quite as bad
as in some parts of the nation but everything has deteriorated  so basically in the third
district the current economy and its outlook look largely like those of the nation as a whole and
all indications are that this recession will certainly be one of the worst in the postwar period
there are lots of reasons for doom and gloom  as we have just heard there are lots of
reasons that we think that this recession and this weakness will continue perhaps for some time
to come  but somebody has to take a somewhat more optimistic viewjust to make the
distribution complete if for no other reason right  laughter  i think there are common
elements to many business cycles  i also find that one thing people have focused on a lot
regarding the press and other things is that business sentiment consumer confidence and how
people feel about the future appear to be very sensitive in this particular phase of the cycle
those things are pretty gloomy right now but i would suggest that many economic cycles do
have some commonalities and one of those commonalities that often appearnot every time
but oftenis that sentiment can turn around very quickly and it can change for reasons that
sometimes we dont understand or cant easily predict
it is also true that financial markets can move very quickly in various directions  we
have seen them move very quickly to the bad  once markets begin to heal they could move very
quickly in the other direction  so for the sake of optimism i think there is still a possibility that
at some pointmaybe not in the first half of this year and maybe not even in the second but
there is still the hopethings could turn fairly quickly  i am not basing a lot on that but i do
feel somewhat more optimistic than a lot of peopleincluding my staff by the way  they
forced me to say that they take no responsibility for this laughter and so i am letting them
completely off the hook
mr hoenig  they disowned you
mr plosser  they have disowned me  they have had it  i do anticipate the growth
path to look somewhat like that in the greenbook  but i am basically a little more optimistic
than they area very weak first half maybe some positive growth in the second half which may
just balance each other out but that may be an optimistic perspective  i expect the economy to
gain some steam in 2010 to about 3 percent and settle into something closer to a steady state or
at least to a longrun trend in 2011  i have less overshooting in my forecast than some of the
models doand i think than the greenbookbecause as i explained yesterday i have less of an
output gap than they do  i think some of the productivity shock on financial intermediation is
showing up in less of a gap and therefore there is less of a closure and pushback on the other
side  unemployment rates will clearly rise this year above 8 percent but i hope that by the end
of the year they will begin to stabilize or perhaps come down a bit
on fiscal policy as i was asking the staff yesterday i am not very optimistic that the
fiscal package will do much for the economy  a multiplier of 13 is probably pretty optimistic
from my perspective  so i havent built in much effect from fiscal stimulus  i hope the fiscal
package is constructed to give its best shot at helping but i am not entirely optimistic about what
its shape will actually look like or whether it will actually be very much help
obviously because i am on the more optimistic side the risks to my forecasts are clearly
to the downside  my inflation forecast is less deflationary than the greenbooks baseline and it
is similar as i said yesterday to the alternative simulation labeled anchored inflation
expectations  in that sense i am relying more on forwardlooking expectational models than on
distributed lags of past inflation which heavily affect both the output gap and the forecast of
inflation going forward given the wild swings in relative prices that we have seen  i think more
in terms of estimated newkeynesian phillips curves in which the output gaps both are smaller
and have less effect on inflation  again those lead me to a little less dire scenario in terms of the
deflationary pressure of output gaps going forward  i put a lot more weight on our credibility for
keeping inflation near 2 percent than on the past behavior of prices  there is some risk to this
inflation forecast as i alluded to  near term we will not see much inflation  i am not concerned
about that  nor do i think that deflation is going to be very persistent  some of it is already in
train because of the way oil prices are behaving  i do think that in the longer term there are
inflation risks unless we manage our balance sheet appropriately  i am encouraged by our
discussion yesterday and some of the language that we talked about in terms of thinking about
how we manage that in a careful way
finally i would just repeat my requesti think it was at our january meeting on inflation
targetingthat it would be useful in our forecast summaries actually to forecast and report out
as we do with other measures our assumed policy paths that each of us are using for our
projections  in the internal summary you give a verbal description of people saying what their
assumed policy path is  but i do think that it would be useful to summarize those in terms of
both ranges and central tendencies because as we moveassuming that we can and doto a
more explicit inflationtargeting regime that range of central tendencies for the assumed policy
paths should be added  i think it will both help for transparency reasons and help anchor
expectations as to what we are doing and that would be good  so i would encourage us to
continue to pursue that effort and of course i am in favor of the longerterm projections  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  we are in the midst of a very deep and
protracted downturn and i have to squint really hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel  it
is a sad commentary that the one glimmer of light during this intermeeting period has been that
economic developments have been roughly in line with our expectations  in other words we
were braced for the bad news we received  for example we had expected a dreadful holiday
retail season and that is precisely what we got  one of my directors the head of a national
department store chain reported that his company posted its worst season since it was founded in
1901  we had anticipated severe hemorrhaging in jobs and a sizable jump in the unemployment
rate and that too is what we got  many of my business contacts are reporting layoffs and wage
freezes  one unpleasant surprise among the economic data was last weeks 15 percent drop in
housing starts  the residential housing sector has now shrunk so much that the only real
assurance that it will ever stabilize seems to be the fact that construction spending cannot go
negative  this is just about the only zero lower bound that is working on our side  laughter
turning to financial markets it is comforting that lending terms eased in a few markets
notably money and mortgage markets  but equity markets continue to sink and credit spreads
remain breathtakingly large  another of my directors the chairman of a large wellknown
apparel company reported that his company which is rated bb looked hard for additional
financing and the best they could come up with was a loan rate of 18 percent  we have also
heard many reports concerning the tightening of trade credit  indeed a particularly severe
shortage of credit to finance international trade flows may conceivably help explain why both
exports and imports are shrinking by abnormally large amounts relative to the decline in gdp
looking ahead i expect that as in the greenbook high borrowing costs and the
continuing credit crunch will help prolong the recession for at least a couple more quarters
accordingly i project that real gdp will decline  percent this year and the unemployment rate
will rise to 8 percent  however i am hopeful that a large and timely fiscal stimulus will help
kickstart a recovery by the end of the year  in particular based partly on our situation in
california i think the greenbooks assessment of the impetus provided by the proposed federal
fiscal stimulus directed toward state and local governments is on the pessimistic side  the
greenbook assumes that such spending will roll out slowly over the next several years providing
little nearterm stimulus  however my contacts told me that in california a lack of funds has
already halted construction on a number of public infrastructure projects and these projects
could be quickly restarted if federal funds help the state close its huge budget gap  outside
california the data suggest that most of the country is facing nearterm cuts in state spending in
areas ranging from education to construction and it appears that the fiscal stimulus will allocate
money largely to those states that could most use it to avoid immediate spending cuts and finance
shovelready infrastructure projects  still even with a large fiscal stimulus it will take many
years before the economy returns to potential and economic slack is eliminated
unfortunately over the intermeeting period i have become much more pessimistic about
the downside risk to my modal growth forecast owing to the rapidly deteriorating condition of
the banking system  for much of the past year it was the financial sector that was constricting
the real economy but now the slowing economy is returning the favor  the sharp decline in
equity prices and increases in cds spreads for bank holding companies since our last meeting
presumably reflect the markets concern about the likely magnitude of losses that will hit the
banking sector  these losses now reflect a broadbased deterioration in performance across the
whole spectrum of consumer and corporate lending  as i mentioned yesterday i share president
hoenigs concern about commercial real estate over the next few years  i fear a cycle in which
rising vacancies and falling valuations make it impossible for owners to refinance loans that will
be coming due leading to forced selling and intensifying downward price pressures  such a
development may undermine the soundness of many regional and community banks whose
exposures to this asset class are substantial
let me conclude with some discussion of the outlook for inflation for which there are
also sizable risks  i expect core pce price inflation to come in at about 1 percent this year and
then edge down a bit more in 2010 and 2011  given the sizable downside risks to the forecast
for economic growth the risks to inflation also appear tilted to the downside  as in several of
the greenbook alternative scenarios it is not hard to imagine a situation with excessive declines
in inflation and a longlasting deflationary trap much like japans experience and perhaps even
complete with zombie banks  of course i am reminded that the last time we were concerned
about the possibility of deflation in 2003 we were headfaked  the deceleration in prices during
that period was not sustained and it was actually concentrated in a few categories of goods
particularly used cars with very flexible prices and owners equivalent rent
my staff has taken a first look at the current episode in order to see how widespread
deflationary pressures are across various categories of goods and services  given the available
data they find in this preliminary look that the recent deflationary pressures are more prevalent
now than during the 2003 deflationary scare  just as in 2003 some recent price declines are in
categories of goods with highly flexible prices like used cars and apparel where price cuts could
reflect a temporary response by retailers to sell off excess inventory  however disinflationary
pressures are somewhat more prevalent now than in 2003 in categories of goods and services
characterized by sticky prices  we will be analyzing these data in greater depth going forward
and monitoring them but we think they raise the risk that we could see a prolonged period in
which inflation falls well below the level consistent with our dual goals of price stability and
maximum sustainable employment  that leads me especially now to favor going ahead with
the publication of our longerterm projections especially given that inflation over the next three
years our standard horizon looks as though it is unlikely to converge to the levels that we think
most desirable in the longer term  i think it makes going ahead with the extended forecast
particularly appropriate now
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the eighth district economy is clearly in
recession  there has been recent significant deterioration in labor markets  the only comment i
would have on that is that the pace of decline may be somewhat less rapid than in the nation as a
whole  other parts of the country appear to be deteriorating faster but certainly the eighth
district is not immune and anecdotal information from many many sources suggests that credit
market frictions continue to be a substantial drag on economic activity
in the national outlook of course we are in the midst of probably the worst of a sharp
and significant downturn  for the shorter term like 2009 i think the greenbook assessment
seems plausible  longer term i dont think that the greenbook assessment is plausible
according to the greenbook baseline the federal funds rate remains at zero into 2013 even
though according to the table in part 1 page 19 real gdp at that point will have grown at rates
of 26 percent 49 percent and 53 percent for the previous three years and we would still be
sitting at zero according to the forecast  unemployment would have dropped 300 basis points
and we still would not have moved  that doesnt seem very plausible to me as a longerterm
forecast  core pce inflation remains below 1 percent according to the baseline forecast  so this
strikes me as a little implausible and i think it might color our thinking from a strategic
perspective  it strikes me as implausible especially if we pursue some reasonably aggressive
quantitative policies  then i would expect that that forecast would not materialize  so one
reading of the baseline forecast would be that under current planning the fomc is not going to
be aggressive enough to keep inflation at target over a reasonable time frame like five years
that is one way to look at it  to do that you would have to be more aggressive with the
quantitative policies  i am going to have more to say about that
like president yellen i am concerned as some of you know about a deflationary trap
and i just want to stress here for a few minutes the global aspect of this  we are not going to get
any good news globally over the next six to nine months on the economy anywhere  a baseline
assessment would be that this will force the bank of england the ecb and the bank of canada
to zero nominal interest rates  they are saying maybe not but i think that they will all be forced
to zero  of course the bank of japan is at 10 basis points right now  so you will have the g7
economies all at zero  absolutely unprecedented  that is a lot of time to be getting bad news on
the economy worldwide  that is why i am very concerned about deflationary expectations
possibly taking hold and i would regard expectations as being the main determinant of actual
inflation  if that is what transpires we will face many years in this deflationary trap outcome
and that will be a global outcome  i am very concerned about that and so i say the key near
term goal is just to avoid that outcome
how can we do that  well much of the analysis that we have remains in terms of the
federal funds rate and much of our own thinking around the table remains in terms of the federal
funds rate as defining what monetary policy is  if we are not planning to move off zero for five
years i think that we have to change our thinking and we need even greater focus on quantitative
measures in future analysis  like it or not we need to see our policy more in quantitative terms
so that we can assess possible paths and what is going to be effective  i am afraid that is going to
mean talking more about the monetary base monetary aggregates reserves and the balance
sheet  the key thing is how much balance sheet expansion we can accomplish before we run
into inflation troubles  there has to be some kind of answer to this  is it 1 trillionin which
case we are already over and are in inflation danger  2 trillion  maybe 5 trillion  maybe
10 trillion  i dont know where that is right now and i think we need some kind of quantitative
assessment of that
we did get some of that in a simulation from the staffa 1 trillion outright purchase of
treasuries and mbs with minor effects on inflation according to the baseline model  that
would suggest that we have a lot of room to maneuver  i am sure that we could have a long
debate about how accurate that is and everything but that would suggest that we have a lot of
room to maneuver and we could be much more aggressive if we want to avoid this deflationary
outcome which is the real danger over the next twelve months  so i see that as the key to our
policy choices  again if it is not inflationary then we can do a lot more  if it is inflationaryif
it is going to translate into inflationthen we have to be very careful about it  but we need to
get better metrics of where we are on that and right now it just seems wide open
i am going to close with the mystery of the round numbers  proposed expansions of
programs seem to come in suspiciously round numbers  some of them are like 500 billion
another number is 250 billion  contrast this with the accuracy of the federal funds rate where
we will talk about small increments and out many years into the future  this just shows how
much we are used to thinking in terms of the fed funds rate and we are used to doing the
analysis in terms of the fed funds rate  we have lots of mechanisms in place  we have a lot of
inexperience when we are thinking on the quantitative side so we are very rough in our
characterization  that is perfectly understandable but we need to move more and quickly in that
direction  it seems to me that we would like to think maybe in increments of 25 billion or
maybe a little larger increment than that and then have some kind of quantitative assessment
about why the numbers are what they are and what we think that they will do  that will inform
our choices going forward  when we have done quantitative policy in the past it has often been
in terms of growth rates  you would think in terms of money reserves or whatever you wanted
to think about and you would talk about a certain pace of expansion maybe moderating later in
the future or something like that  that seems like a very logical thing to do in this situation  so
those are some thoughts on the economy and on policy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman mr plosser said he would take a more optimistic view to
make the distribution complete  i was going to say that i am going to take the opposite tack but
president yellen pretty much summarized what i was about to say  i do want to comment on my
district and second i want to talk very briefly about microeconomic behavior based on my
discussions with various ceos around the country26 this time  mr chairman you have the
list of who they are outside my district
first with regard to our district like president hoenigs our two districts i believe are
the only ones that had positive employment growth last year  in the eleventh district we
created 192400 jobs according to our adjusted data all in the private sector  that machine has
stopped in fact we would have a straight line downward if we were to chart it  manufacturing
chemicals commercial construction energy and transportation services have reported
significant drops in demand  oil and gas prices have fallen as i think we are all well aware
the rig count has come down accordingly  just for clarification purposes the oil and gas
industry accounts for 10 percent of our employment nonetheless it is a significant factor  our
hightech industry is under pressure  i think anybody who read the newspaper saw texas
instruments recent numbers  they are reflective of what is going on in that sector  exports
which are important have been particularly hit hard by declining growth in external markets
we are the largest exporting state  our exports have declinedinterestingly because of the
stronger dollar but also because of the weakness overseas that you mentioned president bullard
our largest industry in terms of employment our medical industry is suffering in terms of
foreigners who come to be repaired in houston dallas and elsewhere  so our district like
president hoenigs district has now fallen into recession and we are like everybody elsefor
the most part we still are texans  laughter
i will refrain this time around mr chairman from referring to rube goldberg bennie
and the jets and elton john  but i do want to recall what i consider to be a prescient insight of
james madison who said the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of
money  when i speak to ceos around the country i would say that confidence is not just
waning it is in a freefall  it is leading me to conclude that obviously their behavior is becoming
hardover procyclical and the consequences are the kind of serious recessionary scenario that
president yellen pointed out and significantly higher deflationary risks  i think that negative
outlook particularly the outlook for deflation is the 800pound gorilla or my having just come
back from the galapagos the 800pound bluefooted booby in the room  and i dont think we
should be shy to talk about it
businesses are doing what they should be doingwhat you and i would do or what any
woman or any man who runs a business would do under the circumstances  they are
aggressively cutting head count  one of the ceos i talked to who employs one of the largest
workforces in the country said he had three drawers  in the one drawer he plans to cut 17000
jobs unannounced as yet in a drawer to the right of that a still higher number and in a drawer
to the right of that a still higher number  i asked about the drawers to the left and he said
there are none  even businesses that are well run and well capitalized are doing again what
any businesswoman or businessman would do under the circumstances  if they are in good
shape which are few they are using this as a chance to cull out the kind of legacy middle
management they have been waiting to get rid of for some time  therefore the bias is to lower
head counts  we saw pretty dramatic numbers announced one day or two days ago and i think
that is intensifying not lessening  they are implementing pay and merit freezes
they are stretching out their payables  i dont know if this is public or not but ge has
gone around to their major suppliers and asked for forbearance on payablesge aaarated
credit whom we are assisting at this time  they are aggressively pursuing their receivables
particularly the law firms and other servicesector firms  they are running their plant and
equipment at the lowest levels in some time  ti is running its factories at 33 percent of
capacity  the eastman chemical plant in tennessee is running at the lowest capacity utilization
in over 100 years  you see this again across the board  on the rails there are 100000 cars that
are unutilized  and to go back to my favorite metric of the 70footlong lumbercarrying cars
there are 285 miles of unutilized cars of that nature across the rail industry  very critically they
are cutting back dramatically on capex  not a single ceo i spoke to from disney to the large
manufacturers is doing anything but  the least amount of cutback that i heard was 12 percent
and the average i would say is up to a third
so in my view the greenbook base case has understated the effect of this dynamic  my
outlook is probably the most pessimistic of all of the banks  i am line number 8 for those of you
who are guessing  we all know by the way who line number 18 is because it says new york
says this new york says that new york says this  laughter  mr chairman basically my
conclusion is that the instrument panel we are usingand i say this with enormous respect for
the people who do this wonderful work for usis almost inappropriate to the cockpit of the
airplane that we are flying  you mentioned yesterday mr chairman that we are dealing with
these extraordinary circumstances  i believe that the only way we can proceed is to be as deft as
we possibly can be with the kind of programs that we put forward  as concerned as i am about
their longterm inflationary consequences my concern right now is that we are underestimating
the potential deflationary consequence to microeconomic behavior and the macroeconomic
numbers that president yellen mentioned
i would like to conclude with just a comment about the tarp  every banker i speak to
who has taken money from the tarp regrets it  they are hypernegative  they feel that they
have been taken in the words of a borrower of almost 3 billion from the tarp  the rules are
shifting  they are worried about government interference  it is conditioning them to take
actions that again are procyclical in a perverse waydisincentivizing management and
demoralizing the people who work for those firms  i dont know what we can do about that but
i am deeply concerned about this drumbeat now of negativism about the tarp and regret for
having participated  mr chairman i will comment on policy later  i thank you for including
my suggestions in the reworded statements that we have and i look forward to that debate
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  i think greater clarity on the tarp and the bank rescue
programs is essential and it is obviously a very high priority for the treasury and for the
government  i just want to comment that the animal spirit theory of the business cycle seems to
be getting some resuscitation here  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i will resist the temptation to mark down my
forecast right now  laughter  conversations with my business contacts indicate that the
economic contraction is proceeding with full force  these discussions were very consistent with
the nearterm outlook of the greenbook  there were two noteworthy recurrent themes that i
would like to elaborate onthe rapid pace of job destruction and the large uncertainties that
privatesector decisionmakers face
with regard to job destruction consistent with the national data all ceos i spoke with
indicated that they are in the process of largescale layoffs and are studying further job cuts
much as president fisher referred to with his three drawers i did not find a left drawer either
the uniformity of these reports is striking  the best economic report i received was from john
deere that agriculture was still holding up well enough that they are going to do okay they
thought  they are cutting only hundreds of jobs  everybody else is cutting way more  all of
my contacts also say that the easy job eliminations have already been made or are in train
everyone is now contemplating making moredifficult cuts of valuable core staff  these
cutbacks if they go through with them will adversely influence firms ability to respond when
we do eventually see the signs of economic recovery  i could go on  i had a story about how
replacement garbage disposals are down 20 percent which must mean that people are now
washing dishes when their disposal breaks down  but i will stop
anxiety is the second recurrent theme  uncertainty and risk aversion are inhibiting
economic and financial activity  obviously much of this reflects the inevitable uncertainty
regarding the depth and persistence of the downturn  but as president lockhart mentioned i am
also hearing from all quarters that businesses cannot understand the rationale used to undertake
government policy interventions  it is not just businesses  a political leader in illinois the
mayor of chicago whom i will quote tells me that when he runs into homeowners in the city a
number of them have mentioned that they are wondering where their mortgage relief is coming
from  they are thinking about not paying their mortgage  without a clearer understanding of
the rules of the game they will be more cautious and sit on the sidelines and they are clamoring
for greater clarity  when i tried to ask my directors about what they preferred mostwe cant
do more with the funds ratemore policy accommodation or more clarity they clearly chose
clarity over policy  now in spite of what i am going to say i do support our current programs
but i am reporting on our environment and the challenges that we are facing here
with regard to banks relatively healthy banks that took tarp money are concerned that
they will be subjected to future government restrictions  again as president fisher mentioned i
think there is some regret  many bankers who could have gotten by without tarp injections
took the money because they feared that nonparticipation might be inferred as a signal of
weakness  now they are concerned that the costs could be considerably higher than advertised
in part because of political pressure for lending mandates in an economic environment that
makes credit quality challenging
another uncertainty relates to the configuration of credit policies and potential changes in
them  i talked about this just briefly yesterday  in many cases our lending facilities and
government guarantees restore funding sources to some parties but disadvantage others who are
outside the safety net protection  for example i have heard from several durable goods
manufacturers who have captive finance companies that provide funding for dealers or
customers  those who owned a bank or had previously utilized commercial paper funding
thought that the cpff and the treasury guarantees have been helpful  but not everyone is in this
position  according to those who were excluded the separating equilibrium imposes higher
costs on them than the previous pooling equilibrium in which the high costs were shared more
by all of them  similarly the talf is expected to be very helpful to some but not others under
the current plans  though our lending programs have been helpful on balance their differential
effects unfortunately open us up to political risks  it is difficult to do the costbenefit
calculations at the moment because the talf hasnt gotten under way  once we see how well
that is going i think we will have a better idea of that
i also hear repeatedly that uncertainty is boosting lending rates and keeping capital sitting
idle on the sidelines  bankers i talked to who have balance sheet capacity are charging higher
credit spreads  they all tell me that this change is a return to more normal and prudent
consideration of risk and underwriting  so some of that could be what president yellens
borrowers are experiencing as well  in fact in reading through the first report to the congress of
the financial stability oversight board i saw many of these arguments mentioned there as well
so everyone is obviously dealing with this issue
a private equity contact mentioned that he raised a fund of 5 billion this summeri
think it was supposed to be higher than thatbut has not made a single investment yet  given
the scarcity of capital and the high level of risk he says expected returns must be much higher
than before  i wasnt expecting that  this obviously implies that capital injections from these
private sources will be very expensive when they are finally deployed  furthermore some are
concerned that government actions are hard to predict and add to uncertainty  they bring up
what happened to wamus debt holders  one of our directors explicitly mentioned governor
kohns testimony about our hopes for private capital injections alongside public injections  i
went back and it is written very well but no one could envision that happening without greater
clarity on the rules guiding those interventions
all of these stories feed into our outlook for the national economy  our forecast for
growth is very similar to the greenbooks  although my gut instinct is now conditioned to
reflexively mark down every forecast i see coolheaded analysis suggests that risks are a bit
more twosided around pessimistic outlooks  one reason is that the risks surrounding our
expectations for growth over the next year or two depend a good deal on the effect of the fiscal
stimulus  i think in our forecast we have this helping a bit more than most around the table in the
second half  although i favor fiscal stimulus i do continue to wonder about the effectiveness of
such large programs and the ability to efficiently target large sums to the intended projects in a
full and timely fashion  still i thought we were a bit conservative in estimating their gdp
effects so the risks to growth over the next couple of years have some upside possibilities
our inflation outlook is a bit more sanguine than the greenbooks  we see inflation
falling only to about 1 percent in 2011  we are on the high side  of course resource gaps are
expected to be very large and could pull inflation lower than in our forecast  but predicting
inflation expectations seems harder than usual right now  indeed there is a remarkable diversity
of views about where inflation is headed  as many of my academic colleagues are quick to point
out the substantial liquidity injections and large government deficits pose an important upside
risk to the longerrun inflation outlook  not only have academics brought up the enormous
liquidity and unpleasant monetarist arithmetic but so have some of my directors and other
business contacts  on the other hand if agents expectations of inflation focus more heavily on
the large resource gaps we could face significant downside risks as well  so there is a lot to
balance out here  president plosser and president bullard mentioned this too  even dave
stockton sort of gave us a pass on the fact that we have a lot to chew through here as to what
could be a reasonable argument  it is hard to know where expectations balance out but our base
case is that inflation expectations will not decline as much as envisioned in the greenbook  i
dont think this really changes the policy implications  we still need the useful monetary policy
accommodation that is really called for in this outlook  finally i do support the longterm
forecasts  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i wish i could report some improvement
in the outlook from my contacts but sentiment in my district has not shifted  everyone is
anticipating more bad news on the output front and they are much less confident about when the
turnaround is going to occur  importantly this is increasingly translating into reduced
investment plans  my business contacts who were previously uncertain about the outlook but
had not yet reduced their planned investments now seem to be joining the tide of other
businesses that are scaling back  those who had already lowered their investment plans seem to
be accelerating their reductions
i focused my conversations with my business contacts on investment decisions because it
seems to be a critical factor separating the relatively optimistic private forecasters from the
pessimists and my contacts investment plans are keeping me very much in the pessimists
camp  i guess i am balancing out this end of the table  in particular i have revised down
business fixed investment in my forecast  i am now anticipating a steep decline of just over
20 percent in the second quarter and this is the aspect of my forecast that changed the most
during this intermeeting period  i am now expecting to see a reduction in real gdp of
08 percent for 2009 the same as the greenbook  potential growth in the medium term might be
damped by some of these investment reductions but i have not yet revised down my estimate for
potential over the fivetosixyear period which i put at 27 percent
i do see disinflation pressures continuing and the gap remains elevated in my forecast
but the pricing reports from my business contacts remain uncertain  this uncertainty does not
surprise me given that the volatility we have seen in prices has been quite large  but at this
point some people are just as worried about inflation as they are about deflation despite the
latest headline inflation data  obviously they are looking at some of our longerterm policy
decisions  longterm inflation expectations in the michigan surveys that we discussed
yesterday though do not seem to be shifting either up or down yet  nevertheless i do expect
weak demand to gradually lower inflation rates to levels that are going to require further
monetary policy actions  my projection reflects this  but with inflation expectations in my
projection unchanged unlike the greenbook the decline in core inflation in my projection is less
persistent than the greenbook and my outlook for core inflation in 2011 rises to 14 percent
in my view our monetary policy needs to remain accommodative for a time to better
insulate us from deflation and zero bound problems  i am one of those participants who did
change their perspective on the longerterm pce inflation objective  i had been in the
1 percent camp for some time but because of my concern about deflation and zero bound
problems i have raised that longerterm projection to 2 percent for pce inflation
it is difficult to feel very confident as others have said today about characterizing the
balance of risks to the outlook in this extremely abnormal environment  however i cannot help
but think that the risks to both economic growth and inflation are unbalanced to the downside
without data revealing some stability it is hard to argue against more downside risks as others
have commented this morning  businesses are far more focused on survival than they are on
new opportunities  on the inflation front the stability of businesses and households inflation
expectations as we currently see them may not remain and so the downside risk to inflation
remains
regarding the longerterm projections they were proposed by the subcommittee to help
us with our communication with the public and i have enthusiastically supported all of the
recommendations and the steps in this direction  i also support releasing our longterm
projections from this meeting  these projections should help the public solidify their
expectations for economic performance especially when our current troubles have abated  i am
also encouraged that there is strong agreement among the participants as brian reported
yesterday about our expectations for economic performance five to six years out  so i think
releasing them will be helpful  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  anticipating for a moment the statement in the
policy round there is a proposed sentence that says that the committee anticipates a gradual
recovery later this year with downside risks  i am listening to the discussion about nearterm
pessimism and concern and uncertainty but then you mentioned your forecast of minus
08 percent for 2009 which arithmetically suggests that you do think there will be positive
economic growth later in the year and i think many of the projections that we got were in the
same general ballpark  i just want to flag that as an issue for the next round which is whether
we are comfortable talking about positive growth later in the year or whether we think we should
just remain agnostic on that  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  like the greenbook the boston fed
forecast has the unemployment rate well above the nairu and the inflation rate uncomfortably
low throughout the forecast period  because our view is that inflation is more sensitive to
significant excess capacity our forecast implies an even greater risk of deflation than the
greenbooks forecast  even with the substantial fiscal stimulus and recent monetary policy
actions done to date our outlook implies that it will take more than five years to return to full
employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent or more
housing continues to be a key component of the problems  falling housing prices reduce
the wealth of consumers contribute to problems at financial institutions and provide little
incentive for residential investment to improve and so are a significant contributing factor to our
dire outlook  until housing starts stabilize i am skeptical that equity prices will show the
improvement embedded in the greenbook forecast  the rising unemployment rate will be
placing further pressure on housing but will also be a contributing factor in weakening
commercial real estate which a number of people around the table have highlighted
commercial real estate has held up better in some locations such as boston but even those
locations are beginning to soften  with little credit available and vacancy rates climbing my
contacts with real estate developers have become increasingly depressing  in boston
commercial real estate has also been buoyed by building by hospitals colleges and universities
however losses experienced in endowments have caused the construction to be halted unless it
was fully funded and already started
banking continues to be stressed  large banks are experiencing large losses in their
investment portfolios as highlyrated securities continue to sell at very steep discounts if they
sell at all  they are also likely to experience substantial increases in loanloss reserves which
appear to be lagging the problems  the economy and financial markets remain susceptible to
further bad news emanating from the banks  despite monetary and fiscal actions taken or likely
to be taken soon our forecast indicates that without moresignificant actions unemployment
rates will remain too high and inflation will remain too low for an uncomfortably long period of
time
regarding the longterm projections i do support publishing those  i would note as
president pianalto did that there does seem to be an increase as to where people are targeting
inflation  it might be good to update some of the staff work that was done on what the
probability of hitting the zero lower bound is and what the probability of deflation is  it does
seem that our targets have been somewhat based on taste rather than focusing on the tails of the
distribution  i think we have learned something about the tails of the distribution and it might
lead to a more informed discussion if we discussed in more depth what the probability is now
that we have had some recent evidence of those two outcomes  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i think there is little question that the
immediate prospects for the economy are negative  it is going to contract in this quarter
certainly my guess is the second quarter and possibly into the third  but in response to your
question i do think there will be beginnings of the recovery in the second half of the year
precisely for the reasons spelled out in yesterdays presentation  the dynamics of the inventory
adjustment process a gradual further improvement in financial conditions the ebbing of
weakness in housing activity and the consequences of stimulative policies both monetary and
fiscal  so i do think that there is a reasonable probabilityi guess this is going to make me the
optimist at the tablethat something like the greenbook forecast is going to be realized over
that time frame
i know there is a lot of negative sentiment around right now and a lot of negative rhetoric
you know that is part and parcel of a recession  i am not suggesting that we take a lot of
comfort from that but i do think we should keep it in perspective that it goes with every
recession that i have observed  they can say well this time we really mean it laughter but
somebody gave me an article from time magazine back in 1991 and they were describing that
recession just like this one  so we should try to bear that in mind
that said of the alternative simulations the one that really caught my attention was the
more financial stress scenario  i do think some risks are there  they are associated mostly
with uncertainty about programs and prospects  i do think that the establishment and operation
of an aggregator bank assuming it is done effectively would be a good idea  i think it might
even be advisable to go further than that using the swedish example and close down some
large insolvent institutions  i realize that is probably very very difficult and possibly risky but
the benefits could be very high as well in reducing the uncertainty that seems to be plaguing the
financial sector and a good number of its customers  finally i do support the release of the
longerterm forecasts  i think that they provide additional information of value and that they will
help to anchor expectations
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  ill be very brief  our indicators and the
anecdotal reports from the fifth district are quite consistent with the national picture and the
picture that emerges from the reports that we have heard around the table from the reserve bank
presidents so far today  there are only three nuances that i would take note of  one is recent
declines in the wage indexes in the manufacturing and services areas in our districtjust a
couple of months of decline but potentially meaningful  second on the other side expected
prices received in manufacturing have swung decisively from negative territory in november
more than minus 1 percent to positive territory above 1 percent  third a fairly significant
decline has occurred in the last two months in the index for expected capital spending in
manufacturing
on the national level our outlook is basically aligned with the greenbook with a couple
of exceptions  i am a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth when the recovery begins  i
expect inflation to return above 1 percent later this year and to get to about 1 percent rather
than sag in the out years  i do not think we are going to want to keep the nominal rate at the
floor for nearly as long as the greenbook expects  i am thinking liftoff is likely sometime in
2010 rather than in 2012
i endorse the statements made by presidents evans and stern and others about the
depressing effect of the lack of clarity around government credit policy  capital injections that
have occurred so far and prospects for future capital injections seem to have induced a tipping
dynamic by which we are at a corner solutionthere is no private equity coming in for fear of
what future capital injections might do to them and so we are left with the public sector being
the only source of prospective capital  looking ahead at the strategy i think we want to get to a
point where the banks are healthy which means they can raise equity privately  that transition
is the hard one to solve and i endorse the ideas that president stern just alluded to  i would also
say that i think public statements about our potential future credit programs and the expansion of
our programs to asset classes could well be a drawback in that they add uncertainty about where
we are going to come in next  i will cede the rest of my time to my past self  laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  as noted around the table
the economy continues to contract at a rapid rate and there are few signs that the pace of decline
has slowed  that said clearly there are some positive elements in aspects of financial
conditions such as interbank funding rates  corporate bond and mortgage rates have eased
somewhat since our last meeting  oil prices have fallen a lot over the last few months and that
has bolstered household real income  moreover the political uncertainty about what is next
should lessen now that the obama administration has assumed power  over the next few weeks
the administration is likely to pass its fiscal program and announce how it plans to utilize the
second tranche of tarp monies  that should lessen some of the uncertainty in financial
markets about the public policy response
but these developments should not comfort us much if at all  in my view the risks to
the new york fed forecast and the greenbook forecast which dont differ very much remain
very much to the downside and we should emphasize that when we motivate our response to the
crisis  in particular in addition to the labor market woes already cited the banking system is
probably in worse shape today than it was last fall despite the injection of hundreds of billions of
dollars of government capital  moreover the ability of the federal government to adequately
recapitalize the banks as loanloss provisions mount is in question impaired by the question of
whether the size of the second tarp tranche will be big enough to do the job  a good portion
of this is going to be used for other areas such as mortgage foreclosure mitigation and there are
exceedingly poor politics associated with giving more resources to aid the banks making it
problematic whether a third tarp installment which might be needed can actually be secured
politically  inadequate bank capital is at the core of our problems and i am not sure we are
going to be able to solve this problem quickly or definitively  it would be much better to do too
much in terms of capital injection taking back that excess later than being a day late and many
billions of dollars short as we have often seemed to be throughout this financial crisis  adequate
capital in the form of tangible common equity is essential to restore confidence improve credit
availability and restore good market function
the second issue i would like to talk about is household net worth  it is contracting at a
rate exceeded only in the great depression  we should not understate the size of the blow to
us households for households wealth has been evaporating at an alarming rate at a time when
the personal saving rate has been unusually low and the safety net had been whittled back  that
is not a good combination  this is the first big economic downturn in which defined
contribution plans which are immediately affected by changes in financial asset value are the
dominant source of retirement income for many households beyond social security  in the past
definedbenefit plans with a fixed monthly payment insulated retirees and their families from
changes in financial asset values  moreover the decline in wealth may not be over  although i
will not predict the equity market the greenbook forecast of a 12 percent annualized return over
the next two years could turn out to be optimistic  after all if bank balance sheet constraints are
causing risk premiums to be unusually high couldnt this also translate into the risk premium for
the us equity market remaining high with lower equity prices at least over the near term
finally even if equity prices do better it certainly looks as though housing prices will continue
to fall for another year or so until housing inventories are brought down to morenormal levels
third the us recession is occurring in the context of global weakness  this means that
the trade sector is not likely to provide any significant degree of support here or anywhere else  i
think this is very important especially in the context of the staffs analysis of the reinhart
rogoff consequences of past crises  the staff forecast showed a lesser decline relative to past
crises and what has happened historically  yet in those past crises individual countries had the
out of depreciating their currencies and having trade improvement  we do not have that out this
time and i think that just makes me a bit more nervous about whether our experience will be
more in line with those historical experiences
i know the greenbook and our own modal forecast assume that the recovery will begin in
the second half of the year  i hope that is true  but it strikes me that until our banking system is
repaired the risks lie clearly to the downside of such a traditionalrecovery vshaped forecast
at a minimum the degree of uncertainty about the outlook is unusually wide as described in the
greenbook and illustrated by the width of our fan charts  we are well outside the range of
normal experience  in such circumstances modelbased forecasts probably should be viewed
with somewhat greater skepticism and the greenbook acknowledges that  under these
circumstances the federal reserve needs to continue to be aggressive in providing liquidity and
balance sheet capacity to the private sector  the goal should be to ease financial conditions as
much as possible in the current environment subject to the constraints imposed by our legal
authority subject to protecting ourselves against credit risk and the issues posed by further rapid
balance sheet expansion on our exit from our current suite of special liquidity facilities
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i find myself within the central tendency of
committee projections maybe including the philadelphia staff in that central tendency
laughter
mr plosser  they will be pleased
mr kohn  but there is not much comfort in numbers is there  i think i agree with
everyone that data since the last meeting indicate that the steep decline in spending and
production is ongoing  employment and production have been cut back especially sharply as
businesses are adjusting to the collapse in demand that we saw last fall by reducing inventories
and head count very very aggressively  final demand is also continuing to contract
consumption business equipment spending and housing are all falling rapidly and commercial
construction is on the cusp of pulling back in a major way  there is really no sign that the pace
of decline in final demand is slowing
to some extent the ongoing drop in final demand reflects the playing out of the
downward shift in demand and the tightening of financial conditions that we saw last fall  that
is we are seeing the kind of multiplieraccelerator effects that we saw before on consumption
working through declines in jobs and income now on business capital spending working
through expectations of weaker sales going forward  i think i saw an accelerator chart yesterday
we are also feeling the lagged effects of tighter credit in the fourth quarter and sharp declines in
equity and housing markets then  now presumably these sorts of downward pressures on
spending from past real and financial shocks would diminish over time though it could be quite
some time before they play out
unfortunately i think that on top of the playing out of those effects there are some
further new pressures on spending coming into play  further declines in prices of housing and
equity in the first quarter will weigh on consumption going forward and equity prices were
lower than what the greenbook had assumed  the senior loan officer opinion survey suggests
that the tightening of credit by banks is continuing and i am sure that the mounting layoffs are
increasing the fear of job loss and continuing to depress if not depressing even further consumer
confidence and sparking pullbacks in spending  we have also heard many reports this morning
about businesses becoming much more cautious  finally as the chairman and others have
remarked the remarkable widespread decline in economic activity abroad is just holding down
demand all over  it is reducing our exports  no part of the world economy is providing support
to global demand
despite some signs of improvement financial markets remain severely disrupted and
fragile  outside the gses securitization markets remain virtually shut down  credit to any but
highquality borrowers is still very expensive  for example the yield on bbb corporate bonds
which would cover the median business is about 2 percentage points higher than it was in the
first half of september  that is a pretty sharp increase in the cost of capital  i have been
especially worried as others have remarked about some of the developments in the last few
weeks some sort of backsliding in markets  we have seen a further drop in equity prices and a
strengthening of the dollar pointing to somewhat firmer financial conditions at a time when we
need financial conditions to be easier  the further evidence of the vulnerability of banks and
other intermediaries has been especially concerning  losses by these guys were much larger
than people anticipated even people with pessimistic views  cds spreads have risen in response
to the sizable drop in stock prices  libor has backed up again a bit
we have said all along that part of the adjustment to the new steady state in financial
markets will involve more credit flowing through intermediaries and less through securities
markets  but intermediaries remain under substantial pressure to deleverage shrink assets and
conserve capital and liquidity and there are lots of losses to come even under the moderate
recession scenario of the greenbook  the staff estimates that there are about 1 trillion of losses
coming from the third quarter on with about half of those at us banks and thrifts  so there is
much more pain to come  in this environment both perceptions of risk and aversion to risk will
remain heightened  banks will be capitalconstrained and worried about their survival and
credit will be tight for some time even with a welldesigned tarp that has taxpayers taking tail
risks from lenders through capital insurance and asset purchases
still i do have a rebound in the second half of the year  i do not know exactly what
quarter it will occur in but i do think there is a reasonable hope  that is my modal forecast and
i think it is reasonable  there are a couple of reasons for that part of it  it depends on
government actions  this massive fiscal stimulus is one obvious thing but i also think a well
designed support package for banks that does reduce uncertainty and builds capital and further
federal reserve actions that work to ease financial conditions will at least help to stabilize
markets and stop the continued erosion of credit availability and perhaps begin to turn things
around with slow improvement  i think that at least we can stabilize things
there are some natural market mechanisms in play as well that will help to bring the
economy back  the drop in energy prices is certainly building real incomes and the fall in
house prices and lower interest rates are increasing affordability and i think will ultimately spur
purchases  i think demand curves do slope downward and to the right eventuallyat least that is
what i learned in economics 101  laughter  i am waiting for it to work in the housing market
the initial negative effects of that initial pullback in spending the multiplieraccelerator effects
and the tightening of the fourth quarter will eventually fade  businesses did come into this
downdraft with inventories under good control and their prompt responses in cutting production
and employment mean that inventory and staffing levels will soon be comfortable even for very
low levels of demand and production and hiring can be raised promptly in line with demand
in my forecast the unemployment rate did get to 8 percent  with that slack inflation
continues to drop and even with longrun inflation expectations well anchored i had total and
core pce in the 1 to 1 percent range in 201011 well below my objective of 2 percent  i do
think that risks remain to the downside mainly from financial fragility and the possibility of
tighter credit conditions lower equity prices steeper declines in house prices et cetera  it could
take longer than i have assumed for the financial situation to stabilize  in that environment there
is a riskand not a trivial riskof a deflationary spiral taking hold with even lower inflation
expectations feeding high real interest rates with policy stuck at the lower bound
in that regard i like others support proceeding with our longrun projections  i think
they will help to clarify where we want things to go in terms of inflation and could be especially
useful in our communication about inflation when it seems to be getting below where we want it
to go  they might help a little around the edge to anchor inflation expectations  i would not
expect a huge effect but they could help a little when we really need it  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me begin with financial markets before
turning to the economy  on financial markets i will give a few points that i have described in
my notes as tenuous improvements in market functioning but i really think that i will describe
them as feigning optimism  so let me feign optimism with three points on financial markets
first bridge financings  we saw earlier this week a very large bridge financing to fund
an acquisition  i would say that bridge financing by its very terms probably could not have come
together 30 or 45 days ago  there are a couple of other very large deals being contemplated that
require bridge financing and i would say this bridge looks different from bridges of the last
cycle  i would not call it a new equilibrium but i would say that neither the acquirers nor the
lendersunderwriters would have been prepared to agree to terms like this  this is a bridge that is
not very good  it is a bridge that gets expensive in a hurry  it is a bridge that could give way
but buyer seller and underwriter came to terms here and whether or not this is a new
equilibrium in funding transactions with some assurance that there will be cash for a period of
time if the acquirer does not lose its rating this and other factors suggest that at least there is a
new negotiation happening  so i would say that it is a positive sign
second trading businesses  the firms that are left and that still have meaningful trading
businesses had fantastic januaries  why did they have such good januaries  there is just not a
lot of competition left  bidasked spreads are wide  a lot of volatility is now presumed to be
built into the models and into traders behavior  i would say that if you are still in the trading
business and you are looking for sources of profit and good news to get you through this cycle
some are there  the capital intensity of these trading businesses is lower than it was before  the
necessity for firms to commit capital to be profitable in trading is lower  so i would say again
that this is some tenuous improvement and may be a new equilibrium there which is good news
for some of the survivors that are in trading
third and i think probably the most essential point is about the prospects for large
internationally active financial institutions to raise capital  there is a good chance that in the
next week there will be a large nonus internationally active financial institution that tests the
capital markets for a very large capital raise  it is likely to be a rights offering  it is likely to be
at a very significant discount to its current share price but i would guess that it gets done  if it
gets done that says that there still is private capital at some price  maybe it is a price that
existing shareholders dont like  maybe it is a price that companies dont want  but if those
private markets are open for the relatively strong outside the united states i would say that is
encouraging and we need it  the last 30 capital raises by financial institutions arent just losers
they are big losers and it is hard for investors and others to be opportunistic when they see that
track record  so i think the success or failure of these financial institutions might well be tested
in the next weekwhen we see a pretty good institution give it a real shot  so thats my
optimistic pitch
now words of caution  as trish said yesterday i think that we are back at maybe the
most precarious state in financial markets that we have been at at least in a regularly scheduled
fomc meeting and i think that this is going to be an awfully consequential few weeks  it is
true that risk aversion has been reduced but only a bit  we have seen a bit of an unwind in the
flight to quality and a bit of an unwind in the flight to the most liquid securities but boy i
would be hesitant to overstate the improvement here  even if we look at highyield markets and
we note that they are off their peaks there are still expectations of defaults that are near
depression levels  i want to take comfort in some of these data but i think it is probably just a
bit of a bump from the darkest scariest days that we had in the prior period
second i would note that share prices of large financial institutions broadly and regional
financial institutions have all gotten crushed in 2009 so far and that has raised real questions
about the solvency and durability of their franchises as publicly held entities  so the question
remains  how have credit markets seemed to improve along the lines that trish and bill have
mentioned while we have had this huge markdown in the valuation of these companies  again
as trish noted yesterday i think the answer is us the fed  sure we have seen some
improvements in markets that we havent been directly involved in like a2p2  but the feds
facilities have been primary in support and have been a partial bulwark against broader financial
institution weakness  so in some ways i use that to reconcile the discrepancy between
improvements in market functioning at least in the very short term and the miserable news that
we have had on broad financial institutions
third a note of caution and concern  there are still a lot of 50cent dollars out there and
no one seems to want to buy them  that these arbitrage opportunities are still available in
markets that dont require great sophistication and that people are not taking them up should tell
us that something is very very wrong  only those buyers who have longerterm horizons risk
neutrality and balance sheet capacity can participate in these markets and those are criteria that
are not found among most folks that could partake  so these 50cent dollars might be 60cent
dollars but they are still out there and that should be telling us that things are in pretty tough
shape
finally and maybe of most concern about the state of financial markets is the large and
increasing number of financial institutions including many that are most systemically important
that are perceived by markets to be effectively insolvent or nearly so  singledigit share prices
for a large class of financial institutions do not strike me as a new equilibrium  and to avoid the
theological argument that we had a bit of yesterday on whether this is an equilibrium or
disequilibrium i will tell you that i do not think it is going to stick around for long  if you think
about these financial institutions that are trading at 3 5 or 7 i am not sure i understand how
they can continue to get through the next 12 months in that state  i do not know how they can
run their businesses how they can incentivize their employees or how governance will hold with
the specter of continued losses and possible nationalization  my sense is that this is not a
sustainable equilibrium and i fear which way it breaks  i think the specter of nationalization
may delay public market recapitalization of many of these firms though i expect that the new
administration will do all it can to provide clarity  as the real economy continues to deteriorate
i suspect that it will take a couple of shots at this to get it right  and this singledigit share
price might well continue to limit the efficient provision of credit to the real economy and
continue to hinder financial flows  so i am skeptical in a tumultuous world that these single
digit share prices are sustainable for financial institutions and again the way in which they are
likely to break is pretty disturbing
so what does all of this mean for the real economy  others said it more extensively than
i will but the economy is in terrible shape  activity is falling fast with little indication of
stabilization even at new lower levels  as i think dan described yesterday the nature of this
turmoil which i define more as a breakdown of the global financial architecture than some
housingled recession is likely to have a recovery period that is slower bumpier and tougher
than most recent recessions would suggest  as a result of all that i am more negative on gdp
and employment prospects than the greenbook forecast is in both the near term and the medium
term
mr chairman with respect to your question about the second half i think we should see
arithmetically and because of the inventory issue a slowdown in weakness but it does not look
to me anything like a real recovery  i am also skeptical of nearterm gdp growth that is
expected from the stimulus package  i dont expect foreign economies to perform as well as the
greenbook says or to recover even as quickly as the united states will as it no doubt ultimately
will  i expect net exports to be less supportive of gdp growth than the greenbook suggests and
i read foreign exchange markets as being supportive of the view that advanced foreign
economies will actually underperform the united states in the period ahead
a couple of final concerns before i turn to inflation  in a world like this where the model
of capitalism that has come from the united states is now being doubtedmaybe even ridiculed
in some corners of the worldthe risk of big policy errors everywhere not just here but
everywhere is higher  the us weakness in the story linethat somehow this started in the
united states and this is the fault of the united statesmakes it harder for us to stop bad
policies from being undertaken outside the united states  so with all of that i am quite
uncertain about the timing of improvement in financial conditions  the decision on the use of
tarp funding is thus likely to be critically important and this solvency overhang is likely to be
harmful to gdp in the balance of 2009  i think that the framing question for the new
administration should and might be what the official sector can do to help reopen capital
markets so that real common equity that these institutions need can come to bear  what sorts of
risk insurance do we need to provide  i am not sure how the real economy can get traction until
some of those things are answered
finally on the inflation front i will be brief  the inflation picture of course bears
watching but i am still skeptical that deflation risks rank as high as many of the other risks that i
and others have described today  inflation expectations remain key and obviously should be a
focus of our continued discussions here
on the longterm projections and the recommendation that comes from the
subcommittee i support it  the benefits at least in my view will be felt more inside this room
i think it does help us communicate and understand one anothers views  the idea that somehow
that is going to have anything more than a modest nearterm effect on how the world thinks
about inflation and thinks about our behavior probably overstates but i do think it is on balance
a step in the right direction  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  in looking at the banks and talking to the
bankers i started with the fourthquarter earnings announcements  the first part is what they
consider to be real which is the higher loanloss provisions  in this unemployment has led to an
acceleration in delinquencies that goes across all consumer products  the reduced activity in the
cash flow of businesses has resulted in higher ci delinquencies
vacancy rates and the lack of takeout financing are creating problems in commercial real
estate but i am still not sure that is as big a problem as maybe it looks certainly not as much as
in residential with the ability to renegotiate those loans and to continue the cash flow on them
being better than it has been in residential  appraisals took another leg down which has
heightened loss severities  when you combine that with lengthening real estate marketing times
particularly for home equity loans there is less willingness to buy through the first mortgage
and so the junior liens are becoming total loss rather than partial recoveries  i would point out
that the same pessimism about future conditions that drives the reserving also drives the
underwriting conditions for future loans and that is why they are continuing to tighten
not so real in terms of the numbers that showed up in the fourthquarter loss are the
model losses and goodwill impairment in other than temporary impairment particularly on trust
preferred securities there is something just deep in the dna of bankers that they do not believe
they are used to marks on credit and they believe in marks on credit but they do not believe in
the marks based on market conditions  so if you look at these securities if they were accounted
for as a troubled debt they would be written down to 90  if they are accounted for under market
conditions they are written down to somewhere between 30 and 50  in the minds of the bankers
this is a portion of their capital that will return when ultimately their projections of future cash
flows are proved to be correct if they can live that long
the loan chargeoffs would be tax deductible but the security writedowns are not tax
deductible  so when asking them about whether or not they would sell these securities at their
current marks only those who thought they might get some tax advantage would be willing to
sell them at the current marks  in terms of goodwill and these writedowns i really had not
focused on how the goodwillimpairment process works  it is a twostep process and it appears
that now if the current fair value of an acquisition does not equal the goodwill amountwhich
means that the market conditions for bank equities are causing the goodwill to be written
downthey are not really concerned about analysts because the analysts are as we all know
focusing on tangible capital  but they are concerned about the headline risk as their customers
and potential customers read about huge losses in the institutions  finally mortgageservicing
rightsthe one negative consequence of lower rates is that the expected refinance then reduces
the value of mortgageservicing rights
a number of you have mentioned the tarp money  in this case there were several who
were approved for capital but elected not to take it much to the annoyance of the treasury
their reasons were that their capital levels were high or adequate already  they could not see
the loan demand in the future and were concerned about additional conditions that might be
imposed by the congress  many of these had time to actually see the introduction of the frank
bill before they had to make a final decision and that definitely informed the decision  their
concerns are what you would expectthat lending quotas would be imposed and that would
actually increase their risk that the dividend restrictions would make it more difficult for them
ultimately to raise private equity and that compensation restrictions would affect what they view
as strategically important incentive plans  so i do not think that any of them would be
particularly inclined to take another voluntary program
with the smaller banks the mutual and the subchapter s banks just saw a posting of the
terms for them for cpp  this process is taking a lot longer to work through all the different parts
of the system than we might have realized  some have been approved but havent yet received
their money  even on the tlgp the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program many of
them are reporting that they are getting slow to no response from fdic  they were planning to
use these guarantees for lines from upstream correspondents and they are just not getting any
answer  in terms of liquidity all the banks are seeing good deposit growth  however some of
this growth has to be viewed as temporary given that there is a yearend expiration of the
unlimited demand deposit insurance  in normal times you have a parking of riskaverse assets
in bank deposits and those can move out just as quickly as they came in  some are still
concerned about additional funding as well as the examiner expectations or the fdic additional
charges based on expanding nondeposit sources such as home loan bank advances or brokered
funds  some are holding large amounts of excess reserves as an actual or perceived cushion
against funding sources pulling away as well as a demonstration of both liquidity and capital
strength
in lending most of them do report weak loan demand and those that are reporting
stronger loan demand seem to be in markets in which the larger players are pulling back or are
involved in mergers  those that are seeing loan growth dont initially even see the income boost
from that as they have to establish initial reserves on the net growth  to counteract the angry
political climate banks are actively highlighting in their press releases all of their new loan
fundings even the gross fundings  advertising for consumer and small business loans has
improved application volume but the quality is low which leads to lower approval rates on all
types of credit  in terms of construction lending the projects that arent in trouble are simply
finishing out the current phase and stopping and this applies even vertically  one banker
reported a highrise condo project that the builder just capped off at ten stories and decided that
was the end of the project  there is a bit of lending to take over distressed projects of others
there is significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of businesses and consumers with at
least one banker expressing concern about the predictive capability and the stability of credit
scores in the current environment  businesses that are being affected by rapidly changing asset
prices go from positive earnings through the third quarter to chapter 11 by the end of the fourth
quarter
all new loans are priced to higher spreads with floors in them  the range that i heard is
4 to 6 percent  so as we look at what is happening to prime i dont think that is necessarily what
is happening to rates at which anyone is actually borrowing  the big exception to weak demand
is in mortgage applications which are at record levels  there arent as many competitors out
there and as with other credit types the approval rates are lower  appraisals may be a problem
and it is mostly refinance but there is a trickle of purchase activity  they tend to believe that the
purchase activity is currently being deterred by a fear of job loss and expectations for more
government incentives down the road  the rate drop also came at a seasonally low time for
purchasers  then the last piece is the need to sell an existing home and they may be upside
down in the existing mortgage  there are reports of contracts sometimes five deep of the
contract waiting for sale of an existing home that is waiting for sale that is waiting for sale  so if
at some point the first sale can occur it will actually multiply itself in many cases
finally banks are actually getting quite creative in growing or strengthening their loan
portfolios  there is a network of banks in nebraska that are actually counderwriting as well as
participating in larger credits  there was a bank that had offered a 7year or 10year fully
amortizing mortgage trying to take advantage of the new propensity to save and actually has
seen great takeup on it from borrowers who want to use the lower rates to pay off their
mortgages sooner rather than to lower their payments  another one is using the sales force to go
out and offer proactively to restructure business and commercial real estate loans say for twelve
to twentyfour months of interest only to improve the cash flow and at the same time increase the
rate on the loan  another bank is using half of its production teams to go out and sell problem
assets to privatemarket investors who are in their market and familiar with the projects
the bottom linethe community and regional banks are finding ways to survive in fact
three of the banks had record years on the upside for 2008  but it is really ugly out there  so
while there are some signs of recovery in markets they are outside the banking system  i think
that it is going to be incredibly difficult to stimulate the economy through the programs that
involve bank lending  it is going to take moredirect programs such as mortgagebacked
security purchases or the talf to act as standins for the securitization markets  in fact i
believe this is the time to expand the range of mortgages that are eligible for gse guarantees to
include jumbo and higher loantovalue mortgages as a way to replace the currently closed
privatelabel markets  even if the government takes the problem loans off bank balance sheets
we will still ultimately need to liquidate much of the underlying collateral and that is going to
require more lending than the banks can currently fund  we could also find ourselves at some
point using the discount window in more and more of a home loan bank way for core funding
rather than as a lender of last resort to fund the nonmortgage lending
i know that all of these suggestions go against the grain of almost everyone here but
frankly capital alone just will not restart bank lending  i think the banks are going to pull back
repair as best they can and create the earnings to rebuild their own capital until they can begin to
attract private equity  president bullard yesterday used a phrase  he said that people do the best
they can given the constraints they face and that is how i would title my remarks  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you all very much  debbie informs me
that coffee is ready  why dont we take a 20minute break  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene  i can start by offering a
summary of the discussion around the table which was informative as always but fairly uniform
this time  the intermeeting data as we have seen indicate a very sharp contraction both
domestically and abroad which reflects in large part the effects of the intensification of the
financial crisis but also the increasingly powerful feedback loop from the economy to financial
conditions  many people noted that the financial conditions remain very fragile  consumption
employment and production indicators suggest that the pronounced contraction in activity in the
fourth quarter is likely to continue through the first part of 2009  participants noted that the
slowdown is very widespread across sectors  some participants expect a return to positive
economic growth later this year citing such factors as fiscal policy lower oil prices inventory
adjustments government efforts to stabilize the financial sector and the possibility of improving
confidence  however uncertainty remains high and risks are to the downside as sentiment is
currently very depressed  moreover based on experiences with other financial crises the
possibility of a protracted slump or lshaped recovery remains significant
some financial markets including markets that have received fed support such as the
money and mortgage markets have shown modest signs of improvement  however bank losses
for the fourth quarter were greater than markets anticipated and many institutions remain under
substantial stress  bank loans are declining with tighter terms falling credit demand and a lack
of creditworthy borrowers  very tight credit conditions are in turn affecting both households
and firms  declining asset values are also affecting wealth and confidence including declines in
definedcontribution pension plans  whether the new government initiatives to stabilize banking
are successful will be an important factor in the outlook
consumers continue to retrench cutting back as balance sheets are repaired and
precautionary saving rises in an uncertain environment  employment declines have been large
with firms projecting further job cuts ahead and there are wage and salary freezes occurring
fiscal stimulus could also provide a boost to consumer income and support state and local
spending which is currently contracted  there has been little indication of stabilization in the
housing sector as house prices and building activity continue to decline  nonresidential
construction is likely to fall as financing dries up and fundamentals weaken  a number of
participants expressed concern that commercial real estate could follow the path of residential
real estate  other investment has also contracted in light of prevailing uncertainties including
uncertainties about government policy tight credit and low capacity utilization  lower
commodity prices have affected drilling and mining activity and to a lesser extent agriculture
exports and imports have both fallen sharply reflecting both domestic and global slowdowns
and possibly lessened availability of trade finance
inflation has fallen significantly and looks likely to be low in the medium term  there is
some risk that inflation could fall below levels consistent with good economic performance and
some expressed concern about a deflationary trap possibly at the global level  however
maintaining stable inflation expectations remains very important  currently there appears to be
quite a bit of diversity in the publics inflation expectations including concerns about both
deflationary and inflationary outcomes  that is just a summary of comments i heard
i do not have a great deal to add on my own  let me make just a few remarks
obviously i share with everyone the observation that activity has fallen very rapidly perhaps
not much more quickly than expected at our last meeting but still confirming the very substantial
effects of the financial crisis and the overall tightening in the credit markets  a somewhat bigger
surprise is the decline in global economies which has been more severe than anticipated  on a
global basis this seems very likely to be the worst postwar recession and the global declines will
make it more difficult for the us economy to recover
as others have noted there have been some marginal improvements in a few financial
markets and the feds programs at least in those markets seem to have had some benefits  we
have seen a little improvement in corporate bond markets as well  the most important news on
the financial side since the last meeting though has been the worsethanexpected results in the
banking system the fact that we have had to go back and address instability in two of our largest
four banking organizations despite the large injections of tarp capital  it is indicative of the
tremendous concerns about the stability of the banking system  the continuing credit losses
pose a real challenge both to the banking system and to efforts by the government and the
treasury to restore stability
my general view is that although fiscal policy could be helpful and will probably provide
some impetus later this year and next year we may see something similar to what we saw in the
spring which was a temporary boost and then very little sustained recovery unless we can get
substantial improvement in the banking situation  i share the same uncertainties about the
prospects of recovery or at least the beginning of positive economic growth later this year that
others have  the greenbook case relies fairly heavily on inventory dynamics  currently
inventory liquidation is subtracting from growth and so stabilizing final sales at zero by
midyear which seems like an easy task would be sufficient to give us some positive growth
that said it is probably not such an easy thing to ensure that final sales stabilize  we should
expect to see continued declines in investment and in trade  we may see some growth in
government obviously with the fiscal programs but even so to get to zero growth in final sales
the greenbook needs to forecast growth of about 2 percent in real consumption in the second half
of the year which given current developments may not be so easy to obtain  so like many of
you i guess that we will see a stabilization perhaps some modest positive growth in the latter
part of this year but this is by no means a certainty  it will depend very substantially and
perhaps most fundamentally on achieving some stabilization in the banking sector  i dont think
that other financial improvements will compensate for continued deterioration in bank balance
sheets
the next intermeeting period will be very important  it is of great significance that we
have now made it through the political transition period  i think it did create additional
uncertainty  it is interesting that the implications of the march inauguration in 1933 were the
reason we pushed it back to january and we may make it november 5 next time  laughter
but i think it is good that we do havepolitical views notwithstanding one way or the othera
new administration with some political capital and with a mandate to take action and we ought
to know a lot more by the next meeting about what those plans are and how the federal reserve
fits into the overall program for stabilization  so i think that this intermeeting period will be
critical
on inflation i tend to take the conventional view that the extent of slack and declining
commodity prices because of both domestic and foreign slow growth will lead to declining
inflation  i recognize the issues about expectations  i think on the whole though that they will
move down rather than up  it is important to note that given that we are already at zero in terms
of the policy rate the dividing line between deflation and inflation is not really that significant
its disinflation at this point which both raises real interest rates and creates the debt deflation
mechanism that moves wealth from debtors to creditors which for good reasons is probably not
a neutral transfer because of the effects it has on financial stability  so i do think that
disinflation is a concern but that is probably a relatively slow moving process and we can keep
our eye on it  i do hope that improving our communication with respect to our inflation
objectives will on the margin be beneficial  of course inflation expectations are important both
in financial markets and in the general public  i imagine our communications are more effective
on the financial side but we can also try to have a more aggressive communication strategy with
respect to the broader public
i will make just one comment anticipating policy a bit which is that i think we ought to
recognize that we could be at zero for quite a long time  there were a few comments that with
economic growth expected beginning in the second half we might be coming out of zero
relatively soon and it could be the case  i think we have to be prepared to do that  but even
aside from the greenbooks very long term projection of zero rates i noted that if you take the
central tendencies of this committee for 2011 and stick them into a taylor rule you still get
minus interest rates  so i still think based on the median and modal views of this committee it
is likely that rates will be low for some time  therefore i agree with president bullard that we do
have to think very hard about our quantitative approaches and as we discussed yesterday find
ways to make them more effective to communicate them more accurately and to assess them
quantitatively  those are all critical steps and that will be a challenge for us as we go forward
so even if we are not moving the federal funds rate around there is still going to be a great deal
to do and a great deal to think about  let me stop there and turn now to brian madigan to
introduce the policy round
mr madigan4   i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  this package includes the revised versions of the draft statements that were distributed on monday  by lowering the target federal funds rate essentially to zero at its last meeting the committee entered the realm of unconventional monetary policy  given our limited experience operating in this regime i thought it might be helpful to begin my remarks by reviewing the various tools you might employ if you decide that further monetary policy stimulus is appropriate
first the committee can communicate its intentions in ways designed to influence the expectations of privatesector decisionmakers  for example as president plosser noted the committee could provide additional information to the market about its expectation for the path of the federal funds rate  in its december statement the committee offered some information about its intentions by indicating that it anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time  the committees action to lower the federal funds rate target nearly to zero was greater than market participants generally expected and its message about shortterm rates remaining low for some time further conditioned expectations  interest rates moved noticeably lower across the entire yield curve indicating that the combination of the action and the statement provided additional monetary stimulus
the committee could be more specific about the future path of the funds rate for example by being more explicit about how long the target rate is likely to remain close to zero or even by providing your expectations to the market for the trajectory of rates after liftoff  for example just as you provide ranges and central tendencies for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation you could likewise do for

the fed funds rate  however given the enormous uncertainties about the financial and economic outlook you might be uncomfortable providing such specificity and you may be concerned about the implications for the federal reserves credibility if those expectations proved to be far off the mark  varying your qualitative descriptions of the path of the funds rate in light of incoming data is another possibility  at some point you might also wish to consider articulating the conditions that would prompt you to begin raising rates  at a minimum though as the chairman noted the committee could continue to reiterate that interest rates are likely to remain low for some time  unless the evolving economic outlook strengthens considerably relative to your economic forecasts delivering this message continuously seems likely to be an essential component of the committees communications for a while  the committee could also communicate its views regarding other policy tools  for example it could be explicit about the amounts of open market purchases that it intends to undertake the types of securities it intends to buy and the time frame for those purchases  the committees december statement followed this principle regarding mortgagebacked securities and agency debt
the committee could also expand its communications about inflation  for example the committee could make clear that any nearterm declines in inflation below its optimal level will be strongly resisted in the medium to long term  with nominal shortterm rates now pinned at zero measures that support inflation expectations may reduce the upward pressure on real interest rates that develops as actual inflation declines thus limiting the extent of restraint on aggregate demand that emanates from that source  in this regard you have several communication approaches at your disposal  for example as discussed earlier this month the committee could establish and publish a numerical longerterm inflation objective
or the committee could decide to proceed with collecting and publishing participants longerterm projections for inflation growth and unemploymentan approach that most of you evidently support  of course you could implement both approaches with the longerterm projections explaining how you envision that inflation will approach your longerrun objective over time and how growth and unemployment will converge toward their steadystate values  a decision on the longerterm projections is included later in the agenda for todays meeting  a third possibility is that the committee could use its statement to make clear that it recognizes the risk that inflation could fall persistently below its optimal level  by explicitly identifying that possibility the committee would suggest that it is prepared to take actions to counteract such an outcome
the ability to further expand the federal reserves balance sheet to apply additional economic stimulusor at least to offset some of the restraint coming from developments in financial marketsoffers another set of unconventional policy tools in particular the federal reserve can expand its use of what the chairman has called credit policies by implementing programs designed to facilitate flows of credit to borrowers who normally obtain funds through markets that have become dysfunctional  to an important degree the opportunities for exercising these tools will be driven by ongoing market developments  apart from expansions of existing
facilities either in terms of amounts or in terms of coverage it is difficult to predict exactly how such credit policies might be augmentedor even whether it would be desirable to create new facilitieswithout advance knowledge of where market conditions might deteriorate next  however as discussed yesterday and today the federal reserve has already indicated the possibility of expanding the talf to include commercialmortgagebacked securities  in assessing whether expansion of such facilities is warranted the federal reserve will need to take careful account not only of the possible efficacy of the programs but also of a range of other considerations including moral hazard and the implications for the systems exit strategy in returning to a normal framework for conducting monetary policy
other aspects of the federal reserves balance sheet such as the reciprocal swap arrangements and the systems portfolio of treasury and agency securities offer a third set of opportunities for providing greater stimulus  at the moment there would not seem to be much motivation for increasing the authorized amounts of swap lines as conditions in global interbank funding markets have generally improved somewhat over recent months  however expanding the systems purchases of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities might represent a more compelling possibility for applying further monetary stimulus  purchases of longerterm treasury securities are another possibility  the systems mbs purchases have already had a notable effect in lowering mortgage rates and the committee might see further action in this direction as likely to be productive  as discussed by the committee yesterday purchases of treasury securities might help improve conditions in private credit markets but engaging in such purchases would also have some disadvantages
alternative a for this meeting the draft statement for which is shown on the next page of the exhibits would exercise several of the options for applying more stimulus  the decision to apply additional stimulus under this alternative would be explained by the indication in the first sentence of paragraph 2 that the economy has weakened somewhat more than anticipated  it would also be supported by the statement in the last sentence of the paragraph that the downside risks to the outlook are significantan adjective that as president fisher noted might be seen as less alarming than sizable while still getting the point across  paragraph 3 would indicate that the committee expects inflation pressures to remain subdued and it would reveal a concern that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer run  as i noted previously identifying this risk explicitly could help reduce the extent to which market participants lower their assessment of the fomcs inflation expectations in response to nearterm declines in inflation  paragraph 4 reiterates the point made in december that the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and again notes that these measures are likely to keep the size of the balance sheet at a high level
the next two paragraphs provide language to explain the choice of an expanded program of purchasing mortgagebacked securities or a new program to purchase treasury securities  alternative 1 would increase the planned purchases of mbs to
750 billion the current pace of purchases would be maintained and the additional amounts would be purchased in the third quarter  market participants have already expressed some concern about what happens when the currently authorized program concludes at midyear and an announcement of additional purchases of mbs seems likely to at least maintain if not increase the downward pressure on mortgage rates alternative 2 would entail the purchase of up to 250 billion in treasury securities this year  the final paragraph of the statement for alternative a notes that the federal reserve will soon implement the talf  it also indicates that the committee will be monitoring the federal reserves balance sheet and assessing whether expansion of  or modifications to the lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability  all in all alternative a would be most consistent with a view that the economic outlook is unsatisfactory that the committee has several tools that it can employ to improve that outlook and that the benefits entailed in using these tools outweigh the costs
alternative b shown on the next page would also express the view that the federal funds rate is likely to remain low for some time but it differs in some notable respects from alternative a  the first sentence in the second paragraph cites evidence that the outlook remains weak but does not state that the economy has deteriorated further  however like alternative a it notes that the downside risks to the outlook are significant  the inflation paragraph also points to subdued inflation pressures but it omits any indication of concern about the downside risks to inflation  the final paragraph notes that the fomc stands ready to expand the quantity of its mbs purchases and the duration of the program as conditions warrant this indication would also help address market concerns about the end of the program at midyear
the draft indicates that the committee is prepared to purchase longerterm treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets  this wording is intended first to indicate that the committee has reached a decisionit is not still evaluating possible purchases second to suggest that the committee does not see such purchases as the most beneficial action the federal reserve can take in current circumstances and third to note that conditions could change in a way that would prompt the committee to initiate purchases
overall alternative b does not entail additional action at this meeting  the committee would indicate a possible expansion of its mbs program without taking such action now  but the statement would suggest that the fomc is unlikely to purchase treasury securities at least absent a significant change in circumstances with market participants evidently building in significant odds of fed purchases it seems likely that such a statement could spur a noticeable backup in longerterm treasury yieldsperhaps as much as 20 basis points or so  the committee might be inclined toward alternative b if it sees the economic outlook as not having deteriorated materially since the last meeting  it might be encouraged by the tentative signs of improvement in some financial markets and believe that further improvements are possible as the talf comes on line  it also might think that the passage of a large fiscal stimulus package is likely and that further significant
legislation to provide support to financial markets and institutions could be forthcoming from the congress  in these circumstances and with the federal reserve already having applied considerable monetary and financial stimulus the committee might think it most reasonable at this time to monitor the effects of the actions taken to date assess the likely effects of further policy actions and be prepared to implement additional measures such as expanded purchases of mortgage backed securities if needed
alternative c shown on the next page of the handout also would express the view that the federal funds rate is likely to remain low for some time  it would note that the federal reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and would note the imminent implementation of the talf  however this alternative would be silent on further federal reserve actions to support credit markets and stimulate the economy  with no mention at all of possible purchases of treasury securities market participants would likely conclude that the federal reserve had dropped the idea and treasury note and bond yields could jump appreciably  more generally analysts would infer that the federal reserve was unlikely to take further stimulative policy actions  alternative c is most consistent with a view that considerable monetary and financial stimulus has already been applied and that the potential costs of further stimulative actions by the federal reserve outweigh the potential benefits
the statement released after the december meeting is included as the last page for your reference  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  questions  all right  if there are no questions
why dont we begin our policy and statement goround  lets start with president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i prefer alternative a  the current
outlook envisions an inflation rate below 2 percent throughout the forecast period  we have
judgmentally adjusted our inflation forecast upward relative to the straight model outlook  thus
our forecast entails a significant risk of deflation occurring in 2010 unless additional actions are
taken  i see little harm in expanding our program of purchases of mortgagebacked securities
and gse securities to lower mortgage rates further  while this alone is unlikely to be sufficient
it will help stabilize housing and the financial sector  i would prefer this policy to purchasing
longterm treasury securities  rates on longterm treasury securities remain quite low as many
investors prefer to hold government securities of all maturities  trying to reduce the spreads
relative to treasuries is likely to be more effective as it more directly attacks the elevated
borrowing costs
i would note that in our own projections over the threeyear period not a single one of us
had an unemployment rate back below 5 percent and i would note that only one of us thought
that we would get to 2 percent if that was our inflation goal over the threeyear period  the
difference between alternative a and alternative b is whether we say we might do something
versus doing something  it does seem that if all of us think that we are not going to get to where
we want to go within three years this would be the time to actually do something  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman obviously as we have said the downside risks to the
economy are quite large in part because we are involved in very serious banking conditions that
probably also will worsen significantly over the next several months  in particular the exposures
of the banking system and insurance industries to commercial real estate as we have said
represent a significant risk both to financial stability and to economic activity  there has been
some improvement in financial market functioning in recent weeks but most of the improvement
is tied to the significant support from our programs and other government programs and not from
the markets repairing themselves  these repairs still lie ahead i suspect and this will absorb
increasing amounts of our time as we try to deal with that
second over the next several months fiscal policy will take center stage  i think this is
the first phase that we are hearing all the discussions about now and this committee will need to
decide how it should position itself relative to a potentially large amount of new fiscal stimulus
that has really not all been defined at this point  i suggest it would be prudent then to wait to see
more about the form timing and likely effect of the fiscal stimulus before firmly committing to
new expansionary policy programs that would be defined in alternative a  in addition fiscal
steps to deal with toxic assets and thereby improve the functioning of the financial system may
alter our approach to supporting the financial system and market stability  i think there are some
pretty significant issues around these institutions that will be discussed in the very near future
consequently i favor alternative b rather than alternative a at this time
also as to additional nontraditional monetary policy measures that we might employ i
agree with the board staffs recommendation that we retain the option of purchasing longterm
treasury securities at a future date but not engage in these purchases now  i do agree with what
president rosengren had to say about that  treasury purchases would send a clear signal  in
addition to what president rosengren said they would clearly begin to acknowledge the
monetizing of our deficit  at this juncture i would prefer that we continue with our previously
announced efforts to reduce the spreads of agency and private securities over treasuries  i
would also like to recommend that we think ahead as to how we might provide support to
institutions and markets that provide financing to commercial real estate should conditions in
that sector continue to deteriorate  it would be helpful to try to outline a process that does not
force us to again go around the intermediation process or find ourselves in a kind of very quick
overtheweekend approach to things
i also favor the inflation risk discussion in alternative b  as i indicated earlier the
decline in overall and core inflation in the last couple of months and during the recession is to be
expected and represents really no surprise although it is significant  although i expect inflation
to remain low for some time i do not feel that deflationary risks have increased to the point that
we need to reflect them in our communications  in fact i think that to do so could only lower
inflation expectations and put pressure on real interest rates  ill stop at that point  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b  i think its important to
reiterate that we will likely maintain our target range of 0 to  percent for some time  i am
certainly open to the idea of buying longerterm treasuries but i would not go forward with
such a policy today and i like the wording in b concerning our attitude toward that  i am
certainly also very open to the idea of expanding our purchases of mortgagebacked securities
and supportive of president rosengrens views on this  i think i would not go forward with it
today however given that we have only just begun to buy these securities  we have a long way
to go before we ramp up to anything close to our commitment and right now it makes sense to
wait to see what the administration puts forward in terms of their program to support the
banking system to see if they are willing to collaborate with us in expanding the talf facility
and in what directions they plan to go and in what ways they may proceed to support the housing
market  so just in terms of the timing of a further commitment there i think i would be tempted
to wait
the one suggestion i would make concerning alternative b is that i would like to add to it
the sentence from the end of paragraph 3 in alternative a that concerns the inflation risk
assessment  the additional sentence reads moreover the committee sees some risk that
inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability
in the longer term  i would add that to b because i think it is an accurate assessment of the
situation and commenting on the risk makes our discussion of inflation comparable to our
discussion of growth where we also comment on the risks
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  as you noted we all agree that the
outlook for economic growth is bleak  to be sure our policy actions so far have been
aggressive but even so i have a predisposition to provide further monetary stimulus  from a
riskmanagement perspective there are very few scenarios i can think of that would suggest that
further monetary stimulus would be a mistake  but despite my bias for action i am hesitant
about how to proceed
as i was putting my thoughts together for this portion of the meeting i recalled the many
conversations that we have had around this table about our communication policy  even when
we were operating in a welldefined policy regime we often experienced great difficulty in
determining how best to express our decision and our intentions publicly  now we are operating
in a new policy regimecredit easingthat we understand conceptually but for which no
operational handbook yet exists  we dont know how to write down the policy rule for this
environment and we surely dont have any empirical estimates to guide our decisions  our
discussion yesterday about what the effect is of a 250 billion purchase of mbs or a 250 billion
purchase of longerterm treasury securities demonstrates that we just do not have certainty
around the effects of those actions  before this crisis began the public had a fairly good grasp of
our policy rule  now they are trying to find the new rule and i hope they do not find one before
we figure out exactly what it is  laughter  i certainly hope that we find it before john taylor
does
the serious issue is how we can best manage expectations in this policy regime when we
are so uncertain about so many things  alternative a in my view conveys a stronger degree of
certainty to the public than i have at the moment about our policy rule  i dont know the basis
for selecting 250 billion more of mortgagebacked securities or 250 billion additional in the
longerterm treasuries  i do not want to convey or set up the expectations that by wanting to
ease more we are now going to use the 250 billion increase in our announcement of purchases
whether they are mortgagebacked securities or longerterm treasuries just as the  percentage
point change in the fed funds rate had been viewed in our prior policy regime  alternative b
doesnt cite specific quantities but it does communicate a willingness to step up the pace and to
extend the duration of our credit programs and i think that is the appropriate action for today
the alternative also reminds the public that additional credit easing in the form of the talf and
mortgagebacked security purchases is on the horizon and i think we will be well served to tell
the public as much as we can and then update them frequently as our own views evolve  i think
alternative b does that without overstating what we know
in favoring alternative band i am now the fourth person in this goroundi am going
to offer a fourth alternative in terms of the language  i like president yellen would add
paragraph 3 from alternative a regarding our inflation outlook  then given our goround today
and your comments about how you heard the goround mr chairman i think paragraph 2 in
alternative a more accurately describes the view that we have had more weakening than we
thought  so those changesparagraphs 2 and 3 out of alternative a but paragraph 4 out of
alternative bare what i would recommend for today  thank you
chairman bernanke  just to clarify i think what brian says is right  the only
difference between alternative a paragraph 2 and alternative b paragraph 2 is that in a2 it
says weakened somewhat more than anticipated whereas in b2 it says just remains weak
mr madigan  right
ms pianalto  right and we were commenting that many of us said that things had
gotten weaker  that is the only observation i would make
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  i am going to counsel essentially a wait
andsee attitude and then i am going to confuse you by arguing that later we should be very
aggressive  i think the waitandsee attitude would echo a lot of what president yellen said  we
have a new administration coming in  they are promising to be very aggressive on many
dimensions  one of them is a fiscal stimulus package  i think we want to see what that turns out
to be and what the provisions of that are at the end of the day  there we have some fairly good
expectations but i think i would still want to see how it pans out
more critical are the discussions about direct approaches to try to mitigate problems in
financial markets possibly through an aggregator bank  i see this as absolutely critical as to how
we might proceed going forward so i would want to hear more about what is going to happen on
that dimension  i do think we will get a lot of information over the next several weeks along that
dimension so that is an argument to wait and see what happens  also we have our program of
outright purchases of mbs which is generally regarded as successful but we are only a bit along
on that  we are not up to our 500 billion target and so we can let that continue while we try to
get information about what the new administration has in mind  for these reasons i think my
position is most consistent with alternative b but i do have several comments on the
alternatives
my first commentand i was talking about this last timeis that i would prefer to get
the federal funds rate off the top of the statement  i would move it to the end  this is not
projected to change for a long time maybe four years  what you learn in english class about
writing is that you put your main message first  your main message is here are the things that
are different from where we were last time  obviously the interest rate is not going to change for
a long time  you want to be stressing right off the bat that here is the key decision that we made
today and so i would try to rearrange this to put that first  i do not have specific suggestions on
this  i think that would go a long way to communicate the nature of monetary policy during
2009 2010 and 2011  again i want to stress that we really have to work hard to get the private
sector off the idea that the federal funds rate is the definition of monetary policy  there are
many things that we have been discussing that can be done and we are doing them so we have
to design our statement to reflect that  i think that even our own thinking has not evolved away
from the federal funds rate as the definition of monetary policy as much as it needs to
a central bank that refuses to talk openly about money creation is suspect  if we refuse
to discuss the matter or discuss the matter only euphemistically we will lose credibility
furthermore others will discuss it for us and the private sector will define who we are and what
we are doing  so i think we should be more open in talking about our policy which is direct
open market purchases by reserve creation  we should think harder about that and we should
talk more about that
i think that i have quantitative measures  i know we do not like to talk about money here
but lets talk about money for just a minute  m2 growth was quite rapid in the fourth quarter
and that seems promising to me given the situation globally  but it seems that the staff expects
m2 growth actually to moderate in 2009 down to 3 percent  that seems counterproductive to
me  we should be more aggressive if we want to get something like a broad measure of money
growing rapidly enough that were sure that were going to be able to avoid a global deflation
trap  that gives you something to shoot for  we recognize that the old debates on money
pointed out that linkages are not tied to ultimate outcomes  we know that but still in an
environment of zero nominal interest rates this might be a reasonable way to go  people would
understand what were talking about and would understand that we have our inflation objectives
in mind as we are trying to ease here  so that is just a little comment on m2
i have also come to the conclusionand maybe all of you were ahead of methat time
may not be a healer here as far as financial market problems  there were a lot of comments
around the table that well well give the financial markets more timesix monthsto adjust
and so on  well we are 18 months into this crisis and i actually thought when we were a year
into the crisis that markets had had enough time to adjust  it did not prove to be the case  so the
thing is that these information problems do not go away with the passage of time  i think that is
the key thing that we have learned here  eighteen months along and this is as bad as everthis
is in the last couple of weeks  so direct approaches to solve market information problems are
going to be essential and thats one reason that we need to see what the new treasury and the
new administration have in mind on that dimension  but to the extent that a direct solution does
not materializeand it is certainly very possible that something gets proposed and something
gets done and then it does not work very wellthen that may dictate our policy  we may have
to be all the more aggressive in that scenario but i want to wait and see how this stacks up in the
next few weeks
explicit numbers in the alternatives as in alternative a seem crude and suspect to me
what we would like to be talking about is the growth rate of the balance sheet net of the
temporary components or the easily reversible components  we would like to cull out the
lenderoflastresort programs the ones that we think will go away in a reasonable time frame or
will naturally go away if market conditions improve  but we also have morepersistent or more
permanent components of the balance sheet such as mbs purchases which i do not think we
will be in a position to reverse anytime soon  that to me is just an increase in the money supply
these individual numbers might also create option values to waiting in the market  you might
think that mortgage rates are low today but maybe the fed will come out in the spring and
announce another 500 billion and so you will wait because you think mortgage rates are going
to be even lower in the future  in the past when we have talked about quantitative things it has
always been in growth rate terms or some kind of growth rate strategy that extended over the
whole projection period so the explicit numbers at this point seem crude to me
my sense is that we may have room to do much more in open market purchases than we
have right now based on what the greenbook is telling us  five years from now we still do not
have inflation up at 2 percent as president rosengren pointed out  if that is really what we
thinkand one of the simulations added 1 trillion to that and we still did not hit our inflation
target after five yearspossibly we have room to do a lot more and could be a lot more
aggressive  but i just do not think at this point we have the right metrics in place so i just
cannot be sure at this point  i think that is where we can improve in the next couple of meetings
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i certainly think the economic outlook is
unsatisfactory and it sure has not gotten any better over the intermeeting period  i am not sure it
has gotten materially worse  if i look at the greenbook forecast the revisions to q4 and q1 are
to the right of the decimal point and we have a lot more fiscal stimulus coming  i am not totally
comfortable with president pianaltos suggestion to emphasize that it has gotten worse but
certainly the outlook remains quite weak  i think we are in a situation where we need to be
looking for everything we can do to ease financial conditions  i would encourage you mr
chairman to pursue an understanding with the treasury which you talked about yesterday
about the division of responsibilities on risktaking and also about reserve sterilization over time
in particular if we can get legislation and understanding on the latter that enables the treasury
or even better the federal reserve to issue bills without debt limits and congressional controls
what you called yesterday the shadow price of our balance sheet space would diminish very very
considerably and we could play the more aggressive role that president bullard was talking
about  we wouldnt have to worry about how we are going to take it back  if we have another
tool to take it back we would be much more aggressive on our activities
i think right now the constraints on the financial system are more about capital and
worries about future capital downside risk than they are about liquidity  i do like the division of
labor in the talfthat the treasury takes the risk and we supply the liquidity  i think i am
uncertain now whether it will be effective  i think there is a good chance but as we get
experience with that we should be looking very hard at other markets like cmbs that might also
be helpful  also we should be looking at how we could be useful in other aspects of tarp 2
subject to the constraints about risktaking and balance sheet space that you had noted yesterday
mr chairman  i think lifting and ringfencing assets may be very very valuable to reducing risk
and stabilizing the system
on the treasury security purchases i think it is correct not to do that now  i guess i
would keep it a little more on the front burner than what i am hearing from some other people
rates are pretty low now  i would keep my eye on those forward rates  if they look as though
they are coming up i would give it some serious consideration if we thought that the market was
building expectations about future rates that were inconsistent with returning the economy to
high levels of employment over time  i would be more in favor of it
so i think we have a number of things in train right now  we need to see how the
administration is working out  i agree with the others who have said that we are temporarily in
waitandsee mode  i am comfortable with not doing anything now as we have under alternative
b but working very very hard on new initiatives as we see where we can be useful
with regard to other wording issues on alternative b i agree with president yellen and
president pianalto that taking that sentence from a about inflation being too low and putting it in
paragraph 3 here would be good especially in conjunction with that help to preserve price
stability that president fisher suggested we put in the last paragraph because now we are
helping to preserve it from below  i think those two things would work together and i hope we
have the longterm projections coming out which will reinforce that message  so i agree with
that
president bullard yesterday and again today emphasized whether the monetary
aggregates or reserve aggregates can be useful to us  i guess i start somewhat skeptical about
that but i think we should be doing very hard research about whether broad measures of money
or narrow measures of reserves have some relationship to spending even at the zero bound
president bullard you said that m2 growth looks a little low to you this year  under these
circumstances how are we going to raise that  will putting in more reserves do anything  i am
not sure but i would encourage you and your staff and others around the system to work hard on
whether these quantitative measures are more useful to us right now  thank you mr chairman
mr hoenig  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes president hoenig
mr hoenig  two or three people have mentioned the last sentence in paragraph 3  i
would just like to get a bit of reaction from governor kohn or president yellen  my concern
with putting that sentence in is that you change expectations toward the thing you are trying to
avoid  if we suddenly start saying that we are thinking inflation is getting too low and it is not
consistent people then are going to be convinced that it is getting too low and we are going to
put more pressure on it  we ought at least to think about that before we get on a bandwagon
here  that is my caution  i do not know if anyone wants to comment
mr plosser  i would just reiterate that  i worry about that phrase for exactly that
reason  we potentially shape the expectations in a way that we do not want to have them shaped
by going too far in that direction  so i share your view
chairman bernanke  it is a very difficult question  on the other hand it also
suggests that our policy will be more aggressive  so it is a bit hard  i honestly do not know
mr plosser  or in fact it may suggest that if we believe it our policies arent going
to be enough to prevent it
chairman bernanke  i see  president lacker
ms yellen  it is in our longerterm forecasts
mr kohn  yes  well we will be publishing forecasts that have those inflation
numbers in them
mr lacker  the spread of views on this is likely to be related to the extent to which
we believe our credibility is completein other words if we think that expectations about
inflation are so fragile and so changeable that our statement highlighting the possibility of
deflation could move them around  on the other hand you could take the point of view that they
are so well anchored that it will not move them around  i find myself in the hoenig and plosser
camp on thisnot viewing them as as well established as we want  well that is consistent with
my statement
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  the tension here is that this is probably factually correct
and so the question is whether or not you want to say what is factually correct because you are
afraid that it will influence expectations
mr plosser  well there are a lot of things that are factually correct that we dont
say
chairman bernanke  that is also factually correct  laughter  others can
comment on this  i must admit to not having a strong view myself  i think the cowards way out
is to say that we do not know yet  that would be one reason president yellen to delay a
meeting or two before putting that in  but of course i understand exactly what you are saying
and it may well be the case that this is yet another way of signaling a longterm aggressive
policy  but president evans you are next so why dont we just go straight to you
mr evans  let me ask a question  has anybody conveyed that thought in speeches or
testimony either from you or governor kohn in which case it would be less newsworthy
chairman bernanke  i do not think so and that is why i am a little leery
mr evans  all right  thank you
mr yellen  i have certainly said it in speeches
mr evans  right  i may have said something like that too im not quite sure  okay
thank you  i do find myself largely in agreement with the emerging consensus here  in fact as i
was listening to president yellens comments i found them to be wholly satisfactory from my
viewpoint  i do have a preference for alternative a today  i think obviously what we would like
to do is to lower the funds rate but we cannot do that  so we are struggling for the best way to
do that and we do not have a great way to understand exactly the influence of our credit
programs on that
i ask myself what the value of waiting and seeing is right now  on the one hand we have
not implemented the talf although we have been talking about it for quite some time and so it
will be useful to have some experience with that and see what the signals are coming from that  i
find myself in agreement with governor kohn on this but i am unsure how it is going to work
out and so there will probably be some adjustments  then i ask myself whether we can afford to
wait given what we are looking at  it does seem as if there is a lot of uncertainty as to fiscal
policyexactly what the size of it will be and how it will play out  in our own forecast we have
a stronger role than some others but uncertainty is there  as i looked at alternative a with the
mbs it mentions that we are not going to complete this until the end of the third quarter and
that by itself has a great amount of delay  i think that is very pragmatic and that is the way it
would actually occur  i am not quite sure whether the cost of putting that off and announcing it
at our next meeting if that is the right way to do it would be that high  there is also the
uncertainty of what the administration will pursue  as president bullard and others mentioned
if there is a proposal for a large aggregator bank coming forward from the administration what
will be the size of that  what are the dimensions of that and would we need a big action now or
how would that play into it  there are a lot of uncertainties and so i just cannot say i know for
sure on that
in terms of the specifics i did find myself okay with the language on inflation perhaps as
below rates that best foster economic growth  but i agreethere is a lot of uncertainty as to
how that will be perceived but it does seem factually correct that there is some risk  so i would
be okay with that  i suppose we have not really discussedor have weyour question mr
chairman about the sentence whether we anticipate a gradual recovery later this year  it does
seem to me as though in almost every forecast we see economic growth certainly being positive
by the fourth quarter and we hope by the third quarter  i worry a bit that if we are more
pessimistic in our statement about that it would seem to be some type of vote of no confidence
in fiscal actions that are forthcoming  it doesnt seem to be factually incorrect that we are
expecting this and so i would favor leaving that  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you very much mr chairman  i fully support the expansion that
we have engineered in our monetary liabilities  i view our strategy as having expanded them
fairly dramatically to provide stimulus now that we are at the zero bound  i think our strategy
going forward is going to be focused on maintaining them at a high level and while the economy
is in distress perhaps varying the quantity and perhaps increasing it should distress increase and
that seems productive  when the economy recovers begin withdrawing that stimulus then at
some time in the future lift the funds rate off the floor  i am cognizant that assessing the
appropriate magnitude of that expansion is terribly difficult for reasons that president bullard
and governor kohn discussed  we are in fact at the limit of our professional understanding of
the transmission mechanism although i think there is a lot that is known that we could fruitfully
review and discuss in the committee on this issue  i am less supportive of the way in which we
brought about this expansion in our monetary liabilities as you all know  as i said yesterday
and on many other occasions i think the case for targeted credit programs is weak briefly put
they do not address any demonstrable market failure  they channel credit away from other
worthy borrowers exacerbate moral hazard and set bad fiscal precedents
regarding the exit strategy i do not see anything inherent in the economics that has
motivated our intervention into these programs or that links that to the state of the business cycle
and where the funds rate needs to be  so i do not see why it would necessarily be the case that
when we want to lift the funds rate the perceived needs in any of these dysfunctional credit
markets will have necessarily gone away  i think that is clear just from the way the case has
been made and the fact that credit markets can dysfunction in the way they have been claimed to
dysfunction in peacetime in any part of the business cycle
the talf is our next new targeted credit program to be introduced  it is on deck to be
implemented in february  i believe that it would be better policy for us not to implement the
talf but instead to expand our balance sheet by buying us treasury securities  the effect on
credit markets will be more neutral  it will avoid distorting credit flows across private borrowing
segments  adverse incentive effects would be minimized and i think it would maintain more
distance between us and redistributional fiscal policies  concerning buying treasuries i think
that monetization is something that i am less concerned with because the way i view it is that the
choice should be what we buy in which case we are monetizing the same amount of stuff
i can appreciate the concern that coming at a juncture in time in which a large fiscal
stimulus is being enacted there would be a natural riskand i think it is a riskthat the public
would make the inference that our increase in the balance sheet was at the behest of the
administration  i think we should strive to avoid that  if we maintain our monetary liabilities
flat across this episode for the next quarter or so we would be able to do that but i will admit
that is a risk  you have had conversations and will have conversations with the administration
about the idea of a new accord  as i said yesterday i applaud those  i think that is another
reason to hold off introducing any new program that we might ultimately be consideringand i
think we ought to considertransferring wholesale to the treasury  for all of these reasons mr
chairman unless we decide at this meeting to defer the talf i would respectfully dissent
because i would prefer to expand the monetary base by purchasing us treasury securities
rather than through targeted credit programs  thank you
chairman bernanke  just a small point  i would view it as unlikely that
conditions would be unusual and exigent across a wide span of credit markets simultaneously
when we were having a significant recovery in the economy  but of course that is an empirical
issue  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman
mr lacker  excuse me if i could just replyin the talf as it is envisioned we are
to declare that for three years it is going to be unusual and exigent as i understand it  is that
correct
vice chairman dudley  no not really  the term funding lasts for three years
but the actual program ends at the end of this year
chairman bernanke  right which is similar for example to what the fdic is
doing with the systemic risk exception with the 10year bond issuance  also from a monetary
policy point of view our plan for these programs is to create terms that will automatically
extinguish interest at some point as conditions normalize
mr lacker  so the interpretation is that circumstances have to be unusual and
exigent at the time it is entered into
chairman bernanke  well there are some legal niceties here that we can get to
another time
mr lacker  no doubt  thanks
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i think it is clear that we will be keeping the
funds rate between zero and 25 basis points for some time to come although some time to
come is a bit vague which obviously has some desirability  i recall last time that we had a
significant discussion about making sure that our statements about the fed funds rate had some
conditionality to them  i do not know whether the statement the way it is worded is actually
sufficiently conditional or conveys that message or not but i just raise that as an important
aspect of communicating  our plans are in fact conditional and we need to make sure that is
included
actually i can live with the language in alternative b  i think it does seem to
characterize the current state of the economy which is clearly quite weak  as i expressed
earlier i am really not inclined to put in the additional sentence that president yellen suggested
for the reasons that i worry about the fragility of expectations and i think we need to maintain
our credibility and our firmness with our view that we are going to maintain those  i am also a
little worried  i have two problems with alternative a  one it sounds too panicky to me  the
chairman and actually governor kohn mentioned the fact that things look pretty bleak  but if
you look at the greenbook forecast it is really not that much different from the one in
december  december was a clear shocker if you want to think in terms of changing peoples
expectations about our forecast profile  from december to now it is not entirely obvious to me
that the bad news we have received was that much unanticipatedmaybe a little but not hugely
so i would hate our statement or the minutes to reflect such a gloomy view that the markets read
it as another big downward shift in the forecast because i think it may do more to damage the
markets and cause concern  so i would like to have the minutes and even the statement reflect a
little more that this was not entirely unanticipated which is why i like alternative b  this is not
that big a change in our view which was pretty gloomy to begin with
as i have argued before and others have mentioned anchoring inflation expectations as
i alluded to is central to both our credibility and our success going forward in this environment
i agree with president bullard as he said in the earlier goround that the greenbook pathand i
alluded to this as wellof a zero fed funds rate for the next four years paired with a 3 to
4 percent real growth rate and essentially no inflation to me seems highly implausible both as a
positive statement in terms of a forecast and as a normative one  somehow those three pieces do
not fit together real well in the way i think about the world in part because i am not sure i
understand entirely how the expansion of our balance sheet actually fits into that forecast and
perhaps how that affects inflation as well  so i do not find that terribly terribly plausible
more important if we are to retain our credibility to maintain stability of inflation
expectations we must develop or offer a more transparent discussion of the link between our
current policy actions and that objective or those expectations  i do not think we have done that
yet  in this regard we do need to think more about sizes quantities and evolutions of our
balance sheet  as i stressed at our last meeting and as president bullard suggested there are
ways to begin doing that  i dont claim to know what those right quantitative measures are  i
think we need to do some research  but just because we dont know what the right measures are
doesnt mean that they dont matter or that we should ignore them  the clarity of policy
demanded by the public for the tarp and the pattern of interventions applies not just to the
treasury but also to our bailouts and our interventions  i think we need to continue to work on
transparency in this regard and the way all of these pieces fit together  otherwise i do fear that
we would be further contributing to a delay in the recovery as institutions sit on the sidelines and
investors wait to see what next intervention or bailout is likely to come
so i am not terribly comfortable with alternative a  i dont like naming quantities for
some programs and not others  i think that is not a good strategyit singles out some programs
as being more important  i dont think we know enough about the quantities to be able to
mention them  i also agree with president hoenig and others who have suggested that we really
dont know how the fiscal policy bailout the aggregator bank and our roles in these various
things might evolve  we need to wait and see before we make commitments to specific numbers
of things in which we are not sure what role we will play  finally and related to this i do have
some concerns about continuing to discuss programs or actions that we might choose to pursue
while i understand the intent of that may be to manage expectations and signal our commitment
to explore every possible avenue to support the economy such statements are speculative in
some sense and may at times do more to confuse the market than to settle it  indeed if we were
to talk about things we might do and then decide not to take these actions how would that affect
our credibility and the message that we are sending
in his discussion brian talked about how the phrase about longerterm securities might
be interpretedand this is really what i am referring to  i dont know how it is going to be
interpreted to tell you the truth  i have a lot of uncertainty  but i do worry about our talking in
a statement of policy actions about speculative actions that we dont know whether we are going
to do or not  i worry about what that is going to do to the markets particularly if at some future
time we drop it and that we may have gotten ourselves into a bind by putting it in there  we
need to think very carefully going forward in this regime when we really havent decided yet
what policy instruments we are going to be using and how we are going to be using them
speculating about that in our statement seems to me to be a bit risky
so i can support alternative b mr chairman pretty much as it stands with the caveats
about not being more negative than we were last time and some caveats about both the
conditionality and the forwardlooking statements  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  in my view the worrisome recent
developments in the financial markets combined with the current selfreinforcing interplay of
bank news economic data and deteriorating public confidence call for another increment of
action in advance of the administrations proposals with their inherent unpredictabilitythat is
the unpredictability of the political process  i could or i will accept alternative b but i support
alternative a which i would characterize as signaling that things are a bit worse take out some
insurance and do a little more  i think the characterizations of the state of the economy in
sections 2 and 3 are appropriate  i actually to some extent supported the use of the word
sizable but i am certainly okay with the change back to significant as a safer term  i also
interpret section 3 as saying that at least continued disinflation is a real risk and i think that is a
realistic statement at this time
i support alternative 1 in section 4 with its action of adding 250 billion to the mbs
program  i am persuaded by the staff argument which is supported by my own staff to defer but
keep on the table the introduction of a longerterm treasury securities purchase program
however i would tinker a little with the words prepared to for reasons somewhat similar to
president plossers  i think prepared to may convey too much intentionality  it could be
interpreted as absolutely ready but holding off or conceivably someone else might interpret it
as inclined to but with some hesitancy at this stage  i think it is therefore too ambiguous  i
would prefer signaling that the committee holds open the option of such a program and i
would prefer those words over something like still evaluating  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b as written  i think it does
accurately capture the sense of the discussion here  there are probably other ways of capturing
that sense but for me that does the trick reasonably well  i do think it provides us with ample
flexibilityample leeway in the short runto pursue our objectives  i dont worry much that it
is going to unnecessarily constrain us in the next few months to do what we think we need to do
so i find that all positive  finally i would avoid associating quantities with purchases of
mortgagebacked securities and other things  they seem arbitrary at this point and i think
paragraph 4 as written conveys the message without putting in the numbers  so i am pretty
happy with it as it stands
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i submitted my recommendations in writing  i am pleased
with the way they were included  basically what i am hearing is that we should take
alternative a and append paragraph 4 of alternative b and most parties would seem to be
satisfied at least those that are most worried and expressed themselves  i will use president
yellen as an example but as others did as well
with regard to that one sentence that is at the end of paragraph 3moreover the
committee sees some of risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster
economic growth et ceterai think we offset that by the reference to help to preserve price
stability at the very end  the reason i wanted that includedand i thank you for its being
includedis that it speaks from both sides of this  we are not going to tolerate deflation and we
are aware of the fact that there are concerns that we are setting the stage for an inflationary
backlash  so my recommendation is to use those first three paragraphs in alternative a and the
last paragraph in alternative b  i agree with the majority of the sentiment at this table  i would
not have specific numbers  my colleague to my left refers to that as crude  i would say that it
just puts a target on our chest meaning that it gives the markets something to shoot at  but if we
dont deliver or somehow we are not interested in finally getting those numbers we have
basically set ourselves up for disappointing the marketplace
i would also in the interest of being provocative but at the same time sensible take
president bullards suggestion with a full heart  i would take that first sentence and change it
the federal open market committee will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to
 percent and i would put it as the second sentence in paragraph 4  the fact is that we are
focused on all of the rest  so it would read the federal reserve will employ all available tools
to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability  the
fomc will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent  the focusand
the operative word is focusof the committees policies et cetera et cetera et cetera
so those are my recommendations there  i would like to add one other point mr
chairman and that is when we talk about waiting to see what happens  i think that is a very
good point  we dont know what is going to come out from the fiscal side  we dont know what
is going to be proposed in terms of the treasury  president stern made what i thought a sensible
reference today not only to the aggregator bank but also perhaps to the need to close down some
operations  i hope that we will bear that in mind
i would like to leave you with just a simple analogy  in the medical field the greatest
costs are at the very end of life the last year of life  that is certain that the sting of death will
strike we spend most of our medical expenses keeping someone alive knowing that they are
going to die  it seems to me that we are doing that with too many institutions  you made a
comment in our last conference call that you drew the line at the failure of bank of america  i
think i understand you  but i would not draw the line at letting somebody fail and i think we
need to begin to work our way toward that in order to clear the air and deal with the issues in a
forthright manner  that is a separate subject  i have strayed too far
in summary alternative a the first three paragraphs with paragraph 4 from b and
consider president bullards grammatical change as sensible english  thank you
chairman bernanke  my remark about bank of america referred to a disorderly
or uncontrolled failure  obviously an orderly winddown that preserves stability is a different
matter  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  maybe i will start with a note on the political
economy before turning to the statement  i had thought that we would know the situation was
improved when the fed was off the front pages  i think we have been off the front pages not
because the situation has improved but because the treasury is taking over the front pages and
that is a good thing  so i feel pretty comfortable that we are finding ourselves slowly but surely
into this weeks headlines that we are murky and they dont know  i am not that encouraged as i
think about this statement for us to try to make news if we dont have it  the baton has been
passed to a new administration and we should be cautious about stepping up before we know
exactly where they are and before we know where we are  that is just an instinct which maybe
pervades and suggests a preference for alternative b
with respect to a couple of the items that have been debated on alternative b mr
chairman i would resist the suggestion that we import the sentence in section 3 of alternative a
i prefer to keep it as is  i would rather not to the point made at the other end of the table add on
additional risk at this point in the public square  my own sense is that the risks havent changed
materially since we last met  but adding that sentence suggests that somehow we are now
acknowledging that they have and at least to my mind it is not quite there  even though
sometimes i also have an instinct to make the statement a confessional of sorts i think it is
dangerous for us to do that until the lust is outside our hearts so to speak  laughter
i had always been accused by someone who very recently sat at this table of temporizing
but with his recent absence i suggest that we temporize here on paragraph 3  laughter
though i think it is quite possible that we will include a sentence along the lines that president
yellen suggested put me in the temporizing camp but please dont tell him  so what does that
mean  i like alternative b as written  not to add to your burdens but i am also uncomfortable
with the way the sentence reads on the purchase of longerterm treasury securities  i read it and
i think the markets would read it as that we have reached a decision  the way it is written now is
that we have reached the decision that we are likely to do it later  i think that is not quite where
we are  so given the position we are in i would make the following minor edits which i think
change it a little  i would say the committee also is prepared to purchase longerterm
treasury securitiesnow i change a few words hereif circumstances were to evolve in a
way that such transactions would be particularly effective because again i think as written it
says if evolving circumstances indicate  i think they read that to say we presume
circumstances will be evolving and we will take these actions  i guess it may be more
conditional and take us slightly out of the box in which we find ourselves  so again my
suggestion would be if circumstances were to evolve in a way that indicates that such
transactions would be particularly effective though i think it is ideal that we not find ourselves
in the situation of pondering and debating in the public square  given where we are i think that
is the best alternative we can do at this moment  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i just want to make an observation that if we are going to have the
economic projections come out at the same time the public doesnt read the greenbook but it
does look at our projections  between now and october the inflation forecast will dramatically
change  if we are doing the longrun projections at the same time the biggest bar is going to be
at 2 percent and our forecast is going to say that virtually none of us thinks we will get there in
three years  so in terms of being factually accurate we should at least think about the
implications of our economic projections coming out at the same time
chairman bernanke  to complicate this even further on the one hand this would
be a change from december and there has not been a big change in our view since december
on the other hand debbie points out to me that the minutes from the december meeting had
exactly this sentence about inflationthat some members saw significant risks that inflation
could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels and then similar language that
relates to being below the sustainable level and so on  president lacker
mr lacker  i had a friendly amendment to governor warsh  if evolving
circumstances were to indicate seems more parsimonious
chairman bernanke  all right  we are going to have to review all of these things
in the end here  governor duke
ms duke  thank you mr chairman  i think i am marginally favoring a with b4 or
b with a2 and 3  laughter
chairman bernanke  lets go through that again
participant  but only marginally  laughter
ms duke  marginally  i could be perfectly happy with b  i think the difference is that
it is not so much that we dont know yet that we are going to have to do something more  it is
that we dont know yet what that something more is likely to be  the uncertainties that are in my
mind and those that have been expressed are likely to be resolved by the time of our next
meeting such as the shape and the effect of the fiscal stimulus the strategy for dealing with
weaknesses in the banking system including whether it is going to be additional capital
injections an aggregator bank or nationalization the pace of bank closures and the strategy for
dealing with distressed mortgages and foreclosures and more important our role in whatever
that strategy is likely to be  if our balance sheet is not required to take problem assets from the
bank balance sheets it may very well be required to provide loans for the subsequent purchases
of either those assets or the underlying collateral  finally with respect to commercial real estate
i think that we still need to investigate the structure of the commercial mbs and their
relationship with servicers to see if we are going to have the same modification issues that we
have had with residential mortgages  so with all of those unknowns that are likely to be resolved
in the short term again i am marginally happier with conveying the rationale for greater action
but not yet identifying that action  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  thank you mr chairman  we have been discussing
whether we should embark on a longterm treasury purchase program or whether we should
engage in a greater magnitude or duration of agency mbs purchases  i am not sure these really
are the next and best escalation options  not surprisingly i agree with the staff memo on long
term treasuries since i helped write it  laughter  i think the talf expansion really is
probably our next and best escalation option but we are not prepared to do that quite at this time
because we have to do that hand in hand with the treasury  so i want to agree with governor
warsh that this is probably a time for temporizing
it seems clear to me that we do want to continue to expand our liquidity facilities but to
do so we have to satisfy a number of criteria  i would argue that there are five criteria that any
liquidity expansion should satisfy  first the market in question needs to be dysfunctional and
we might measure that by lack of liquidity higher spreads and lower volumes  two the
dysfunction has to be tightening financial conditions  there needs to be a fairly direct link
between the market in which we are intervening and economic activity  also if there is a clear
alternative source of funds then intervention may not be warranted  third we need to be
confident that our facilities are likely to be helpful in improving market function and easing
financial conditions  the goal should not be to displace markets but instead to provide support
that primes markets to function better  i think the cpff is a good example in that respect
fourth we need to be comfortable that we will indeed be secure to our satisfaction  fifth we
have to be comfortable that exit from these programs can be managed to avoid any conflict with
our dual mandate
the talf program especially if the treasury provides us with some support on the
balance sheet exit issue appears to fit best with these criteria  if the talf works as anticipated
in restarting the consumer abs market and bringing down aaarated abs spreads then we
may wish with the treasury as partner adding additional tarp capital to broaden it to other
asset classes that are also in distress  in particular the cmbs market and the nonconforming
rmbs market appear to be very good candidates  it is not just the financing related to new
activity that matters but also the ability for maturing debt to be refinanced  this is a particularly
important issue in both commercial real estate and nonconforming residential mortgage markets
i believe the talf program is very important because it provides three elements that are not
broadly available to private investors right now1 term funding 2 leverage and balance
sheet capacity and 3 protection against tail risk  the talf would bypass banks and dealers
and provide balance sheet capacity directly to risk capitalcapacity that today is unavailable
because of the deleveraging that is taking place among banks and dealers and making them much
less willing to extend such credit  it also provides protection against tail risk  because the
financing is done on a nonrecourse basis the most an investor can lose is the size of the haircut
in this sense although the talf program is a lending program one can also consider it to be a
contingent purchase program  in very bad states of the world in which aaarated consumer
abs tranches decline sharply in value these securities will be put to the federal reserve and
placed in an spv capitalized by talf money
the second issue i want to talk about is the exit issue  although i agree that this is a very
important topic i wonder how helpful it is to worry about this publicly for two reasons  first
anxiety expressed by us about the exit issue may fan fears that we will not be able to exit
smoothly and avoid an inflation problem  if market participants were broadly to share this
opinion the result could be higher risk premiums and tighter financial market conditions
second the more we express concern with exit and our balance sheet the more we may alter
expectations about how much we are willing to do to support the economy  i think we should err
on the side of reinforcing the message that the fomc will do all it can to ease financial
conditions and stimulate the economy  worrying publicly about the balance sheet seems to
undercut that goal to some degree  at the same time we should work aggressively to make sure
that our balance sheet will not interfere with the appropriate conduct of monetary policy later
and we should clearly explain to the public our ability to do so
in terms of the statement i prefer alternative b language generally but i would suggest
two alterations  in paragraph 2 the language that the outlook for the economy remains weak
seems too mild to me and could be taken by market participants as sounding complacent  i
prefer the language from alternative a which states that the economy has weakened somewhat
more than anticipated which i believe is factually correct and provides greater information
about how the data are coming in relative to our forecast  i also think it signals greater concern
by the committee about the outlook which is where the committee actually is in terms of
thinking about policy going forward  the second alteration i would suggest in alternative b is
where we are talking about the implementation of the talf  we say next month in
alternative b  given that our ability to enact this program is subject to some degree to the
treasurys coming along with us in a timely fashion i think it would be better to change next
month to later this winter which will give us until march 21 giving us a few more weeks
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  that last thing worries me quite a bit  i dont know  what
did we have in december
mr lacker  later this season
mr warsh  how about later  laughter
mr lacker  in the future
mr madigan  another possibility might be just to say soon
chairman bernanke  i thought of that as well but does that satisfy you there
vice chairman
vice chairman dudley  i think later this winter does provide an endpoint  i
am not sure how long soon is
mr warsh  it is always winter somewhere  laughter
chairman bernanke  we have a lot to go through here  so just to get factual
information here my understanding from the staff was that we were well on track to implement
during february and i have heard nothing from the treasury to indicate anything other than
support for this program
vice chairman dudley  yes i think that is correct although the treasury right
now is scrambling to get their new staff up and running  so there is some risk that what had
been agreed to by the old treasury now needs to be sort of relitigated with the new treasury
that could delay our putting out a term sheet to market participants which they really need to
have several weeks ahead of time for this program to get up and operational  i think there is a
good chance that we are still going to be able to make february or certainly early march but we
probably want a bit of wiggle room there because we dont have complete control of the process
chairman bernanke  are you okay with will soon implement
vice chairman dudley  yes  i would prefer winter but i can live with that
soon is factually correct  if we take a broad view of what soon meansyes
chairman bernanke  all right  okay  brian lets accept that one unless
president fisher
mr fisher  cant we just say the federal reserve will be implementing
chairman bernanke  all right  is that okay with everybody
vice chairman dudley  to not specify it
chairman bernanke  all right  the federal reserve will be implementing
thank you and thanks everyone for the useful comments  let me try to address a few other
things here  i think we are very much in agreement on the substancethat we want to maintain
an aggressive stance  i also would just say as a general point that i fully agreeand i am sure
everyone doesthat we want to look for better metrics and better ways of communicating and
expressing  as a general invitation to all of you and your staffs you dont have to wait until the
next meeting and you dont have to wait until the week before the next meeting  we are
delighted to hear explicit proposals for metrics or communication or statements that you would
like to circulate and we can discuss throughout the entire intermeeting period  there is no need
for us to wait until the last minute  so let me just encourage you to follow through with that and
let us see your proposals
there have been a number of suggestions  in the spirit of temporizing i do believe that
although we want to convey our concern about the economy and our willingness to be aggressive
with policy there really is a high likelihood that we will learn a great deal in the next
intermeeting period about what the treasury will be proposing what the congress will be
proposing and what our role will best be fitting into those overall ideas  therefore hearing you
i am a bit reluctant to commit at this moment to a specific increase in either our gse or our
treasury purchase program  perhaps we should have made more explicit yesterday what our
plan was going to be  so i would prefer to maintain the optionality of alternative b which talks
about standing ready both to expand the gse program and to purchase treasuries under the
appropriate circumstances and i will come back to that
the second set of suggestions had to do with the characterization of the economy and
inflation  there are two in particular  one was whether to characterize the economy as weak or
weakened somewhat more than anticipated  i am actually a little surprised to hear the support
for weaker than anticipated in that the greenbook has not really changed much since
december and the thrust of the commentary was that things were weak but not much weaker
than anticipated  i am in your hands  i am going to be taking some straw votes in a few minutes
so this is just a question  my sense on that one is that i could consider different language but it
seems as though the outlook remains weak conveys our view  i am not sure that i have heard
that the outlook itself has changed significantly since our last meeting  that was my sense but i
am willing to be instructed on that  on the statement about inflation being below the level
consistent with economic growth and price stability a number of people suggested that  i think i
am okay with that  it was introduced in the minutes  what i am going to do in a minutelet me
just warn youis take a couple of straw votes and i will ask all participants to tell me whether
you would like to add that sentence or not  i dont know any other way to resolve this since i
personally think we could go either way
other issuesi think it is a very interesting suggestion to move the material about the
federal funds rate into paragraph 4  i wish that you had sent that in a week ago so we could have
thought about it  i think it makes sense but i guess at the last minute here i am a bit anxious
about making that big a change in the structure of our statement  but i reiterate our interest in
hearing proposals for statements throughout the intermeeting period
on the issue about treasuriesit is difficult in both directions  president plosser raises
the question about raising a possibility and then not doing it which is certainly an issue  on the
other hand we have also been criticized for calling audibles on the line at the last minute and
surprising people  so it is difficult  based on the discussion and on things that president lacker
said and so on i think it is in fact a possibility that we would take this route  i personally think
that we shouldnt rule it out  it is not something we want to undertake yet because we certainly
want to find out what the other options are going to be in terms of the other things that the
treasury is proposing and so on
mr plosser  mr chairman on that pointit does concern me that this is a bit of a
conundrum about how we do the statements but i would be more comfortable with the language
that governor warsh suggested which gives a little more conditionality to it
chairman bernanke  well i was diagramming that sentence  laughter
mr plosser   i am sorry  i didnt even write it down  it just sounded better
chairman bernanke  well as simplified by president lacker it was is prepared
to purchase longerterm treasury securities if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such
transactions would be particularly effective  i think thats three subjunctives  laughter
mr warsh  i think the lacker suggestion is if circumstances were to indicate that
mr lacker  right  oh i didnt take out evolving but i am indifferent on that
evolving seems to emphasize
chairman bernanke  but see the purpose of evolving is the sense thatdont
you want to convey the optionality that this is going to take place and will be evaluated over
time  the word evolving suggests an ongoing process
mr warsh  the delta is are the evolving circumstances going to evolve as we
presume in which case we have precommitted to it  or is our decision going to be based on
whether the evolving circumstances change in one way which then triggers our yes
chairman bernanke  so governor warsh there is an if here  i mean that
certainly implies that our action is conditional on certain things happening that may or may not
happen
mr warsh  may i use a life line  laughter  brian do you read it as written to say
that we have reached a decision and our decision is contingent upon facts of the world in the
future or that we have reached a decision and if the world proceeds as we expect it will then we
will do this  i am not sure i picked up from your introduction which you think you and markets
would read
mr madigan  i read this as saying that we dont know how the circumstances will
evolve but if they evolve in the way that indicates that this would be particularly helpful then
we are prepared to purchase
chairman bernanke  well for example one possible theory would be that we
will respond only if there is a big backup in rates and that seems to be an effective approach
that would be an example of evolving circumstances  my guess isthough it is always foolish
to make guessesthat this will be viewed as slightly negative news not positive news for the
treasury market  we will have to see
mr warsh  i would say that treasury markets are sort of 5050 on when we are going
to go forward  so this is really the question  does it go 5545 or vice versa  it is hard to know
i think the sense is that the more they read the if to be an if the more conditional it is and the
more consensus there is around the table mr chairman  so it is really just whether we think
that there is sufficient conditionality as written or whether the lackerwarsh thing adds to the
conditionality
chairman bernanke  well i fear that taking out evolving actually reduces the
clarity because evolving implies an ongoing process  without the word evolving it suggests
that we are still evaluating the current situation and then trying to assess whether the conditions
are met to take the action  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman the action words are prepared to purchase  are we
going to maintain those in there or would we change it keep evolving and put will consider
purchasing
chairman bernanke  again we already have a number of subjunctives
mr fisher  i think it is the prepared to purchase that indicates a decision made and
that is the phrase that bothers me
chairman bernanke  one reason that i was comfortable with this language was
that i do think that we will not be maintaining the world in suspended animation indefinitely
we will have much more clarity i believe by the next meeting and at the next meeting we
would be able to say something like the federal reserve will be focusing its attention on x y
or z
mr kohn  mr chairman i think putting the particularly in there actually steps us
back a little despite the is prepared to  it is an if clause already  i dont see how if
circumstances were to indicate is different from if evolving circumstances indicate
particularly with the particularly in there
chairman bernanke  and i dont want to pull back completely because i do think
there is a realistic possibilityand i realize that there are different viewsthat it is going to
evolve over time  we still have a lot of discussion and further thinking to do not only about the
specific types of purchases and programs but also about how we are going to evaluate the overall
thrust of policy and so on
mr warsh  to conflate game shows i dont want to be voted off the island
laughter
chairman bernanke  all right  have i addressed the major questions  i dont
know  okay  what i would like to do is propose alternative b with two issues that we will now
take a straw vote on  the one change we have agreed on so far is the federal reserve will be
implementing the talf  the other two possible changes have to do with the characterization
of the economy  the first one would be in b2 to replace the first sentence with the first sentence
from a2 suggests that the economy has weakened somewhat more than anticipated
mr evans  mr chairman it is the anticipated  couldnt we just say the
economy has weakened further
chairman bernanke  well there is a distinction between the outlook and the
economy itself  the outlook remains weak
mr evans  in this case it doesnt say outlook
chairman bernanke  all right  well do you want to say the economy has
weakened somewhat further
mr evans  that would be okay with me
chairman bernanke  president pianalto do you have a view
ms pianalto  that sounds fine
chairman bernanke  how about suggests that the economy has weakened
further
mr kohn  what do we have about the outlook then
chairman bernanke  no one seemed to object to the last sentence which gives a
recovery but with downside risks
mr kohn  but it doesnt have a sense that the outlook is weak until that recovery  i
have to think about this  the outlook remains weak and there is
chairman bernanke  i think weakened further is not dangerous
mr kohn  okay  so its the economy rather than the outlook that has weakened
further
mr evans  it is as mild as saying we have stepped from the fourth quarter into the
first quarter which is going to be a contraction
mr lacker  im sorry  i missed whats on the table  is it that the economy has
weakened further or that the outlook has weakened further
chairman bernanke  the economy
mr lacker  the economy  okay  that makes sense
chairman bernanke  okay  so i hear a slight preference forokay brian
suggests that the economy has weakened further
all right  the last question then is whether or not to add or replace b3 with a3  that
would add the sentence that the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time
below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability  i propose to take a straw vote
of all of the participantsnot just members but participants  all those in favor of making the
change  one two three four five six seven eight nine  all opposed  one two three four
five six  all right  i think it is a reasonable change  i dont think it is dramatic  any other
comments
all right  i guess we have made three changes now  i propose alternative b  i think it
conveys the sense of the committee  it maintains as much as possible our optionality while
suggesting that we are going to be aggressive  again we will be looking both to the treasury
and to the government for their actions over the next intermeeting period  once again i invite
members and other participants to submit their suggestions for communication and measurement
over the intermeeting period
i probably should mention that there will be opportunities for us to communicate about
our views further  in particular i have a testimony on february 10 on our transparency and our
communication  i have a speech at the national press club which will have more of a press
conference type of flavor sort of between a speech and a press conference on february 18
then i have the humphreyhawkins hearings followed by budget committee hearings so you
will be seeing a lot of me on television  my complexion is not usually green but probably will be
by then  laughter  so we will have a chance to communicate  and i hope that each of you in
your own speeches and other interactions with the public will take as much of the opportunity as
you can to try to explain what we are doing how we are thinking about the economy and how
we are thinking about our policy in this unusual environment  any other comments  president
fisher
mr fisher  i just want to thank you mr chairman for the spirit in which we have
conducted these conversations in this meeting  as you know at least of some of us felt that we
might be disenfranchised  you may be enfranchising us too much  laughter  but we
appreciate it  at least speaking for myself i want to thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  all right  if we are ready for a roll call vote
ms danker  would you like me to read the statement as amended
chairman bernanke  why dont you
ms danker  okay  the federal open market committee decided today to keep its
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to  percent  the committee continues to anticipate
that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate
for some time
information received since the committee met in december suggests that the economy
has weakened further  industrial production housing starts and employment have continued to
decline steeply as consumers and businesses have cut back spending  furthermore global
demand appears to be slowing significantly  conditions in some financial markets have
improved in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial
institutions nevertheless credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight  the
committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economy activity will begin later this year but
the downside risks to that outlook are significant
in light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months
and the prospects for considerable economic slack the committee expects that inflation
pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters  moreover the committee sees some risk that
inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability
in the longer term
the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of
sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability  the focus of the committees
policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open
market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the federal reserves
balance sheet at a high level  the federal reserve continues to purchase large quantities of
agency debt and mortgagebacked securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing
markets and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the
purchase program as conditions warrant  the committee also is prepared to purchase longer
term treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be
particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets  the federal reserve
will be implementing the term assetbacked securities loan facility to facilitate the extension of
credit to households and small businesses  the committee will continue to monitor carefully the
size and composition of the federal reserves balance sheet in light of evolving financial market
developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would
serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price
stability
this vote will also encompass the directive from page 48 of the bluebook

president yellen                     yes
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  a couple of other small items
item 11 is the longerrun projections  many of you commented  i heard no concerns about it so
why dont we go ahead andpresident lacker
mr lacker  i pointed out yesterday that the distribution of the numbers for inflation
had shifted notably  i understand that peoples views about the appropriate inflation ratethe
steadystate inflation rate that they would put in a taylor rule or some other reaction function
might change from quarter to quarter  i also pointed out that i thought the motivation for doing
that was dissatisfaction with the extent to which the third year of our forecast inflation changed
from quarter to quarter and that it diminished the extent to which that report of our forecasts
served as a proxy for our committees agreedupon numerical inflation objectives  at our last
meeting we discussed adopting an explicit numerical inflation objective  that hasnt appeared
on the agenda today
chairman bernanke  i was about to report
mr lacker  oh okay  i guess my attitude toward the longerrun projections is that i
remain unconvinced as i was in our october discussion that the benefits exceed the costs and i
wanted to use the opportunity here to ask about the status of adopting a numerical objective for
inflation
chairman bernanke  i agree with you that this has disadvantages and advantages
relative to a formal target  absolutely  i wanted to thank everybody for the very useful
discussion that we had in the videoconference and i promise not to have a full discussion of
inflation targets any time soon because i do think we do have a pretty good sense of peoples
views  what i took from the conference call among other things was that the committee was
willing to grant me some discretion to try to discuss with the political bodies what their views
would be on going forward with an explicit objective
as i mentioned to you even before the meeting i had spoken to the administration and i
have had some followup discussions there  my sense is that there would not be any serious
opposition from that side although i need to continue to talk with them  but the more difficult
question is on the congressional side and i have a meeting with barney frank on monday in
which i will raise this issue among other issues  my sense of the meeting was that it was worth
doing some socializing and some exploring of these issues but that we wanted to be very careful
and very sensitive at this difficult juncture about not creating new political problems for
ourselves but only if we can persuade the leaders of the country that this is something
constructive  so i will continue to try to do that and continue to work on this  i do think
frankly that this continued expansion of our projections actually makes it much easier to sell
because it creates a context in which the congress can see that this is only part of a program that
involves meeting both parts of our mandate
mr lacker  i see  mr chairman do you view it as feasible likely or very unlikely
that consultations could result in your monetary policy report to the congress this season
involving a revelation of an objective  or is that too much to hope for
chairman bernanke  i dont know  i will have to see  it will depend a lot on the
reaction i get from a few key people
mr lacker  okay  thank you very much mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman did you have a comment
vice chairman dudley  yes  i guess i am somewhat less than fully enthusiastic
about publishing longterm projections at this time  i could support it but i just want to make a
couple of points  first i think it is a somewhat awkward time to introduce longterm
projections  our forecasts are almost certainly going to be very wrong given the level of
uncertainty  moreover longterm projections may be viewed by market participants as off point
the economy is sinking rapidly yet the fomc is spending its time constructing forecasts for
2011 and beyond
second if the goal is to introduce longterm projections to communicate the committees
views about parameters such as the nairu the potential growth rate and the desired level of
inflation wouldnt it be better to simply proceed and publish those measures rather than long
term projections which are just an approximation of those parameters
third i think the individual longterm projections are difficult to link back to the
projections for 2011  if one of the primary objectives of the longterm projections is to provide
some background for how the projections past 2011 will converge to the committees goals you
might want to consider different ways of constructing the central tendency forecast
fourth i worry a little about what happens when the composition of the fomc changes
the longterm projections that result might change because of changes in the composition not
because of an underlying change in view by individual members  i think it would be hard for
market participants to know how to judge those changes over time quarter to quarter as the
projections evolve
so i can support it but i am not enthusiastic
chairman bernanke  okay  thank you for that  again i think we see that there
are both advantages and disadvantages of doing this  i guess i would disagree only slightly on
the issue of timing in that to the extent that this does give some sense of what the committees
preferences are on appropriate monetary policy over the longer term certainly an issue that has
come around the table quite a bit is the need to stabilize inflation expectations in a situation
where they might be quite potentially unstable in either direction  so that is one consideration
president evans
mr evans  may i make just one quick point  president lacker mentioned that there
was some concern about changes in the inflation longterm projection on a quartertoquarter
basis  i dont interpret the distribution that way  it seems to me as though it was probably
importantly influenced by our discussion at the videoconference and it was a oneoff type of
change  i know i changed my forecast from 1 to 2 percent  i had previously felt constrained
that 1 was pretty much a committee consensus midpoint and so i figured we would be acting
that way  but now with more people thinking it was 2 that was how i changed it  i get a sense
that others around the table may have done the same thing
chairman bernanke  it seemed to be noted that the mode is 2 and so the majority
believe that 2 is the right number and there are arguments for allowing a slightly higher target
given the recent experience  other comments about the projections or inflation targets  well
with the caveats that were raised i still believe that there was a general view that we ought to go
ahead with the longerterm projections as part of the summary that will be published along with
the minutes  so why dont we do that  i have updated you on inflation targets which is still
really at just the discussion stage
let me just ask you quicklythis was our first experiment with the somewhat modified
meeting structureeither now or in the intermeeting period give us your feedback or comments
about the effectiveness of this structure  also if we are going to have an issue in a oneday
context we are going to have find ways to condense parts of the discussion some way or another
perhaps by sending out materials in advance  is there anyone who would like to comment at this
point about the meeting structure or make suggestions  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i wonder if we should have twoday meetings until we get into a
more status quo situation  rather than shortening the meetings i think it was actually quite
productive to have the discussion  we might want to think about whether twoday meetings
until we get more clarity as to what policy should be going forward would be helpful
chairman bernanke  is that a widespread view  all right  we will investigate
we will make sure that it works with peoples schedules and see if it is feasible  but i agree that
it would be very difficult to do what we did in this meeting in one day  other comments or
feedback  all right  hearing none the next meeting is tuesday march 17  thats st patricks
day isnt it  very nice  laughter  we have a lunch available  there is no briefing planned
so our work is done  i hope you will have a safe trip through the weather back to your home
cities  thank you very much
end of meeting
