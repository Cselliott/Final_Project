transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of june 2728 2007
june 27 2007afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everyone  today begins cathy
minehans last fomc meeting  cathy has been a regular participant since august 1994
we will have an opportunity later in the fall to say goodbye to cathy more officially but i
think this will be a good opportunity to thank you for your collegiality and for thirteen years
of tremendous contributions to the fomc  thank you very much  applause
ms minehan  it has been truly an honor and an incredible experience
something i never expected to happen and a joy through the ups and downs and ins and outs
of every meeting  so i thank everybody around the table who has been here and made it that
way
chairman bernanke  thank you and now it is time for the report on desk
operations
mr dudley1  it is hard to follow that  thank you mr chairman  today i want to focus on the significant rise in longdated treasury yields that has occurred since the last fomc meeting  as you can see in exhibit 1 treasury yields have moved sharply higher over the past six weeks although they have recovered a bit in the past few days  at twoyear and longer maturities the shift in the yield curve has been nearly parallel with yields roughly 50 basis points higher over this period  as can be seen in exhibit 2 the rise in nominal tenyear treasury yields has been accompanied by a rise in tenyear tips yields  because the rise in nominal yields has been slightly larger than the rise in real yields forward breakeven inflation rates have risen a bit since the last fomc meeting  for example exhibit 3 shows the trajectory of the breakeven inflation rate five to ten years in the future estimated using nominal treasury and tips yields  this measure has risen more than 20 basis points from its trough in may  so how does one explain the rise in nominal and real treasury yields and the increase in breakeven inflation  in my opinion there is one very compelling explanationmarket participants generally believe that the downside risks to growth have diminished and this has led to 1 a sharp shift in monetary policy expectations and 2 a modest change in investors assessment of inflation risk  but other factors

1  material used by mr dudley is appended to this transcript appendix 1
also played a role including mortgage convexity hedging and perhaps the gradual shift in the appetite of foreign central banks away from us treasury securities toward other assets
as shown in exhibit 4 monetary policy expectations as embodied in the eurodollar futures market have shifted sharply since the last fomc meeting  in may a drop of more than 50 basis points in eurodollar rates was anticipated to occur by the end of 2008  in contrast currently the eurodollar futures strip is virtually flatindicating that market expectations are close to neutral through 2008  this shift in expectations is also evident in responses to our survey of primary dealers  using exhibits 5 and 6 we can compare the dealers forecasts before the may 9 meeting with their forecasts before our meeting today  the green circles represent the average forecast of the dealers the size of the blue circles indicates the frequency of different forecasts and the horizontal dark lines represent market rates  as can be seen in these exhibits over the intermeeting period the dealer forecasts have moved upward but much less than market expectations  this presumably reflects the fact that the market rate represents the mean of potential outcomes whereas the dealer forecasts are modal forecasts  also the smaller shift evident in the dealer forecasts may reflect the fact that dealer forecasts tend to lag changes in market expectations when expectations are changing rapidly  as can be seen in these two exhibits much of the dispersion evident in the forecasts toward lower rates has vanished since the may 9 fomc meeting and the skew to the downside has disappeared  dealers who had forecasted a flat or higher federal funds rate path generally did not alter their forecasts  in contrast dealers who had earlier anticipated easing have eliminated or dramatically scaled back those expectations  for example the blue circles evident in exhibit 5 at rates of 35 percent and 40 percent are not present in exhibit 6
the dealer forecasts support the notion that expectations are changing mainly because market participants are less worried about downside risks to growth rather than because they think that the growth rate of real gdp will likely be stronger  with the exception of the current quarter in which gdp forecasts have been revised upward sharply following a very weak first quarter the real gdp forecasts of dealers have generally not changed materially through 2008  this is illustrated in exhibit 7 instead as shown in exhibit 8 dealers are now collectively more certain about the growth outlookin other words the downside risks to growth have diminished  the reduction in the downside risks to growth may also be important in explaining the modest rise in breakeven inflation measures  if the downside risks to growth have diminished then a corollary may be that the upside risks to inflation have increased in that case investors should show more interest in purchasing inflation protection
the breakeven inflation measure calculated from nominal treasury and tips yields has several components including expected inflation and the premium paid by investors for inflation protection  in assessing the rise in these breakeven inflation measures due to diminished downside risks to growth it is unclear how to apportion the rise in the overall breakeven inflation measures between a higher premium for inflation protection and higher expected inflation  in theory at least reduced
downside risks to growth might reasonably be expected to push both components a bit higher
three other factors behind the backup in treasury yields bear mentioning  first the shift in monetary policy expectations and the rise in longerdated yields have been a global phenomenon  when yields are rising elsewhere that shift should put some upward pressure on us longterm rates  second mortgagerelated convexity hedging may have exacerbated the speed and magnitude of the rise in yields  a rise in yields causes expected rates of prepayment on lowercoupon fixedrate mortgages to fall which lengthens the average duration of mortgage portfolios  mortgage servicers the housingrelated gses and other mortgage holders respond by selling longdated treasury securities and longdated interest rate swaps to reduce the average duration of their holdings  exhibit 9 shows that most conventional fixedrate mortgages are below current mortgage rates  as rates rise these mortgages get further out of the money  this lowers expected prepayment rates and lengthens duration and people react by hedging  as longterm rates keep rising the effect of higher interest rates on duration gradually lessens as the rates on most outstanding mortgages fall further below current market rates  the effect of mortgage convexity hedging is evident in the relative underperformance of tenyear treasuries which is one of the preferred hedging vehicles versus mortgages relative to other treasury maturities  the week ending on june 13 had the biggest rise in longerterm treasury yields  as shown in exhibit 10 this was also the week in which tenyear treasury yields rose the most compared with fiveyear and thirtyyear treasury rates  to the extent that mortgage convexity hedging pushes up nominal tenyear treasury yields more than other yields then it may also temporarily distort breakeven inflation measures  third diminished appetite among central banks for treasury securities may have also been a factor behind the rise in longerdated yields  central bank buying was often a featured part of the story when bond term premiums were unusually narrow  foreign central banks may have played a role in the recent rise in bond term premiums  as shown in exhibit 11 the growth rate of treasury custody holdings at the federal reserve bank of new york has slowed sharply since april
but it is important not to push this point too strongly  although foreign central banks with the largest foreign exchange reserve holdings are diversifying their portfolios away from treasuries they still appear to be extending the average maturity of those treasuries that they hold which implies a continued bid for longerdated treasuries from this source

turning now to other market developments the most striking aspect of this period of rising treasury yields has been the limited effect that this rise has had on the risk appetite of investors in most other markets  this is in sharp contrast to the reduction in risk appetites that occurred in a broad array of asset classes in late february and the first half of march  for example as shown in exhibit 12 the rise in longterm yields has not caused the us equity market to retrench  as shown in exhibit 13 until the past week or so corporate debt spreads have been relatively stable  also in the foreign exchange markets the carry trade remains alive and well  one way to see this is in exhibit 14 which illustrates the change in the value of the yen against high
yielding currencies such as the australian dollar and new zealand dollar as well as against the us dollar and the euro  as can be seen in the late february selloff the yen rallied and the highyielding currencies sold off sharply  in contrast during the recent rise in interest rates the yen weakened and the highyielding currencies appreciated  similarly as illustrated in exhibit 15 although volatility in the us treasury market moved up sharply shown by the rise in the move index volatility in the equity and foreign exchange markets remained quite low
in the foreign exchange markets movements between the major currencies continue to be driven mainly by changes in expected interest rate differentials  exhibit 16 shows the movement in the spreads between the september 2008 eurodollar futures yield versus euribor futures for europe and euroyen futures for japan  as can be seen here interest rate expectations shifted more sharply upward in the united states relative to japan than relative to europe  not surprisingly as shown in exhibit 17 the dollar appreciated more sharply against the yen than against the  euro over this period  the yens weakness which has been persistent but stealthy may begin to receive more attention  after all as shown in exhibit 18 while the nominal yendollar exchange rate has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range in recent years the real effective yen exchange rate has declined sharply over this perioda rate of decline that may be intensifying  for example in may the real effective exchange rate of the yenas estimated by the bishad fallen to its lowest point since the early 1980s and had declined nearly to half of its early 1995 peak  although the june bis data are not yet available the rate of depreciation has likely increased over the past month
although calm generally pervades us financial markets there is one important exception worthy of note  the subprime mortgage space is still very unsettledhurt both by poor housing market fundamentals and by the problems of two hedge funds sponsored by bear stearns  exhibit 19 shows the behavior of the spread on the abx 062 index which is an index based on a basket of credit default swaps on underlying cash securities  as can be seen the spread has increased to a new high and underlying cds spreads have also increased  there is a danger that forced liquidation of illiquid subprimebased securities could exacerbate the pressure on this market  however it should be noted that the bear stearnssponsored hedge funds that are in trouble are not particular large the problems of these hedge funds appear to be mostly exceptional rather than the norm and the counterparty exposures generated by these hedge funds are broadly distributed and have already shrunk sharply in size  that said there still are risks that forced selling could drive market prices down sharply leading to lower marks for other portfolios of assets related to subprime mortgages  this in turn could lead to margin calls investor redemptions and further selling pressure in this market
in terms of lessons learned three points come to mind  first high credit ratings dont fully capture measures of risk  the ratings are based on the risk of default not the market risks associated with illiquidity  as a result highly leveraged portfolios of highly rated but illiquid assets are subject to significant market risk that the ratings
may obscure  second the performance of some of these complex securities is very sensitive to the correlation of returns  as correlations move higher the subordination protection offered to senior tranches in complex securities such as cdos and cdo squared productscdos of cdoscan evaporate quickly  because the ratings for the tranches within such products are typically established on the basis of historical correlations the default risk for some of these tranches may be understated  third markedtomodel asset valuation may artificially smooth returns and obscure risk both to portfolio managers and to investors
the health of the broader cdo and clo collateralized loan obligation markets may rest on this same fragile set of assumptionsthat credit ratings fairly capture risk and that historical correlation relationships will continue to apply  this implies the potential for problems  if investors questioned these assumptions in the subprime area they could also rethink their assumptions about these risks in the broader markets  such a development might lead to considerably less buoyant conditions in the corporate debt and loan markets  it could be noteworthy that some of the indexes that reference credit default swaps in the corporate debt and loan markets have shown some deterioration in the past week
finally there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the may fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  on the breakeven inflation rates the fivebyfive rose
more i believe than either the five or the ten arithmetically because the ten rose more than
the five and its in the spread  it seems odd that a change in the nearterm growth outlook
would have significant implications for fivetotenyear inflation expectations  are there
technical issues there as well as in mortgage hedging or is it just the way you calculate these
spreads with the differences in liquidity and so on
mr dudley  well i think there is an issue  you have to wait for the market to
settle down  to the extent that you are taking a snapshot at a time that more convexity
hedging is influencing the tenyear and the fiveyear has not caught up that can be a
phenomenon  also people in the marketplace say that people in the nominal treasury
markets are different from the people who invest in tips and so the behavior of the two can
diverge for short periods  i would be more confident if a month from now we saw the same
uptick in five to ten years of forward inflation as we do today  i am not convinced it will
necessarily persist  it may be that real yields and nominal yields will eventually equilibrate
as these two markets come back into balance  so my own view would be that it bears
watching but i wouldnt reach strong conclusions about it at this stage
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there other questions for bill
president minehan
ms minehan  my memory of the longterm capital management situation was
that the dollar amount that went into the original program that the investment banks put
together when they started to manage the situation wasnt that much bigger than the money
that bear stearns is throwing at its hedge funds yet the effect on the market seems to be
very very different  having been around during the longterm capital episode i know
that there were real concerns that the domino effect was going to be enormous because of
the market uncertainty and the lack of liquidity and so forth across a wide range of
instruments  is it the range or the nature of the instruments  how would you see the two
situations and compare them because clearly this one for all you can read and understand
and even in your own presentation doesnt seem to be that much of a systemic issue
mr dudley  well i think theres a difference in terms of peoples assessment of
how much risk bear stearns is actually taking on in terms of their hedge fund  my
understanding is that they are extending credit and they are basically taking out the credit
that was extended by the counterparties for the less highly leveraged of the two funds  they
still have equity  they are hoping that they still have equitythat the assets of the hedge
fund are essentially going to exceed the value of the loan that they are making  so theyre
feeling that if all goes well they are not going to be out any money  my memory of long
term capital management and somebody can correct me if im wrong is that the people
who came into that pool were putting up equity  so it is quite different in terms of what was
actually being contributed in these two cases  bear stearns is just replacing the counterparty
borrowings with its own line of credit
ms minehan  but then they managed it so that they did come out ahead over a
period of timeat least thats my memory
chairman bernanke  im sorry  is this twohanded
vice chairman geithner  i was going to follow up on cathys point but i
think don is too
mr kohn  i was going to do the same
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  i was just going to remark that the situation was quite different
ltcm followed the russian debt default  the markets were already in considerable
disarray  all those correlations had already begun to turn and then on top of that you had
the fire sale effects of ltcm  you can see some of that in the subprime market where this
thing is concentrated  it is just not spread out now and the whole market situation was very
different at that time
mr dudley  i think there is a presumption in the longterm capital
management case that a lot of people had similar positions in place  in the bear stearns
case we certainly dont have all the information at this point but the general thought at this
time is that there are not a lot of other people with the same positions in place
chairman bernanke  vice chairman did you have a comment
vice chairman geithner  i agree with all of that but the relative size is
much smallermuch narrower in the type of positions to which theyre exposed  the state
of the world is dramatically different  direct exposure of the counterparties to bear stearns
is very very small compared with other things  bill is exactly right  these guys are making
a loan against a set of positionsa right to those positionsnot equity and what they
realize in the value of those positions over time will be determined  they think there is
positive value in that  so the situation is dramatically different  it does not mean that you
should view it as particularly reassuring  you know these people were exceptionally
experienced in the mortgage credit business and there were smart people in ltcm too
laughter
ms minehan  that was the general opinion
vice chairman geithner  but these guys were regarded as very smart
people who knew the business well and this is just a good example of how little one can
know in some sense and what leverage does to your exposure to liquidity risk  in this case
people were just not willing to give them the time to realize whatever value might be in
these positions and this is just a natural consequence of leverage  people think they had
substantially less leverage than ltcm had in some sense but that is hard to measure
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i would argue that there are similarities in that with
longterm capital most of the stresstesting had been just computermodel driven  then
when actual market prices began to be quoted you saw the deterioration  that is clearly the
case here  the abx is a technical index  for a lot of the cdosquared market nobody
knows what the values as opposed to the prices really are  there is a difference between
price and value  price is what you pay value is what you get  i suppose one charitable
interpretation of this bill would be that the good thing about this situation is that we
actually may be creating a real market to determine value on these things or at least price
relative to value  but i think the phenomena are similar and i would arguehaving been in
the business although the business wasnt as sophisticated when i used to be in itthat this
has broader dimensions than those we had before  if you look at the growth rate of these
instrumentsagain without any underlying sense of what you ultimately can cash in if
youre pressedit has been a straight upcurve  the numbers are quite huge
again i was once a hedge fund manageri know all the tricks that are played there
including by the way the valuation of underlying securitiesin a day when the business
was less sophisticated than it is now  i dont feel i understand this issue  i dont know about
my other colleagues around the table but you did kindly send someone down to brief our
staff on this  they came out with more questions than they did answers but it was very
helpful  i am worried that we will be asked publicly at different intervals and perhaps
starting now what our opinions and perspectives are  im also worried about giving the
wrong answer  i wonder if there is not a waynot during this meeting but at some point
that all the principals at this table can be briefed so that we can understand and have a
common approach to this issue  i dont think the issue is contained  i do think there is
enormous risk  i hope that something good comes out of this but speaking personally i
would like to understand this better and i hope that we all understand it very well in case a
negative scenario obtains  thats just a request
chairman bernanke  we can monitor the situation here and in new york  i
dont know vincent if we have any reports or materials that we can share with president
fisher
mr reinhart  well bill and i can get together
mr fisher  maybe we could just have a common briefing  i think it would be
very helpful mr chairman
vice chairman geithner  i dont think richard you need to be in a
position to offer an opinion on what happened in bear stearns in particular  i dont think
you need to or want to be in the business of doing that in that particular case  regarding a
broader understanding about the implications of what we see in these markets bear stearns
is relevant also in some broader sense  there is obviously value in trying to make sure that
people have as much understanding as they can  my suspicion is that you are going to find
yourself where most people are on this which is with some differing mix of unease and
reassurance that youre not going to resolve fundamentally until we get through the next
period of excitement
mr fisher  well again tim i would suggest that we not comment on this
none of us should comment on it  but 1 it would be good to have an understanding and
2 if it gets worse more intense or troublesome the committee will have to respond in
some way and it would be nice to at least have a common understanding as we go down
this path  thats my suggestion or request
chairman bernanke  there are a couple of themes  one is that the
subprime problems are still being worked through the financial markets  the second is that
subprime is an example of a broader class of structured products that are difficult to value
and that creates some uncertainty in the markets in periods of stress  president lacker
mr lacker  i am always in favor of more understanding but for this
committee what i know about this now suggests that there isnt any reason for us to be
involved  i compliment vice chairman geithner on not serving sandwiches in this case
laughter  i agree with vice chairman geithnertheres a certain danger of our
commenting on stuff like this and leading people to believe that we feel some responsibility
for damping or otherwise minimizing the effects of changes in market prices on the changes
in other market prices
vice chairman geithner  thank you  we are happy to share all the
information we have about the specific case and its broad implications with everybodyin
confidence of course
chairman bernanke  other questions for bill  if not i need a motion to
ratify domestic operations
mr kohn  so moved
participant  second
chairman bernanke  without objection  we will turn now to the economic
situation and we call on david wilcox
mr wilcox2  thank you mr chairman  my colleagues and i will be referring to the packet entitled staff presentation on the economic outlook your first exhibit summarizes our economic forecast  as shown in the top panels we have edged up our forecast for the growth of real gdp this year and next  taken by itself the increase in interest rates that bill dudley mentioned was a negative for our growth outlook but it was outweighed by a variety of other factors including the higher stock market the upward revision to wages and salaries and the more favorable composition of real growth during the first half of this year  as shown in the middle pair of

2  material used by mr wilcox ms liang and mr leahy is appended to this transcript appendix 2
panels we have trimmed our forecast of the unemployment ratepartly in response to the latest readings on this series and partly in light of the slightly stronger outlook for real outputand we now have it ending 2008 just below 5 percent our estimate of the natural rate  as shown in the bottom right panel core pce inflation in the current quarter appears to be running at an annual rate of 14 percent considerably less than the 22 percent we expected as of the may greenbook  however as i will discuss later in more detail we have interpreted most of that good news as likely to prove transitory and so have taken down our forecast for core inflation over the projection period only
01 percentage point
exhibit 2 turns to the market for singlefamily housing  the yellow stripes in the top left panel mark major downturns in singlefamily housing starts since 1970  as can be seen in the box to the right the current contraction now ranks among these major episodes in terms of magnitude  it differs importantly from previous ones however in terms of its origins because this one did not result from a round of monetary tightening aimed at taking economic activity down to bring inflation under control  that difference has important implications for the likely contour of the recovery in earlier episodes once the desired reduction in inflation appeared to be in train the policy rate was brought back down and longerterm interest rates often came down as well  but this time as shown in the middle left panel with policy assumed to hold at its current position we are not banking on any reduction in mortgage interest rates from here forward suggesting that the housing recovery may be more subdued than it often has been in the past
one factor that poses some downside risk is the overhang of unsold homes shown in the middle right panel  months supply remains at a very high level as we illustrated in one of the alternative simulations in the greenbook the contraction in the housing sector could be a good deal deeper than the one in our baseline if builders decide to bring inventories down more quickly
another factor that will be important in shaping the recovery is the pace of sales shown in the bottom left panel  in light of the tighter conditions in the subprime loan market and the recent backup in rates we have sales moving a little lower over the next few months but then stabilizing and beginning to edge up around the turn of the year  the data on both new and existing home sales that were released earlier this week were consistent with our greenbook forecast  i should also note the situation with regard to the price of single family housing  as you know home prices have decelerated greatly and over the projection period we have them remaining close to their current levels on a nationalaverage basis  but our ability to judge the alignment of prices with fundamentals is limited to say the least and a substantial move downward is certainly possible  the bottom right panel illustrates that risk by presenting the estimated valuation error according to the very simple model that we showed you two years ago in our special presentation on housing  to be sure other models deliver different answers but this one judges the misalignment of the pricerent ratio to be historically large  if prices break more sharply

because builders decide to clear out inventories more quickly construction activity might well recover faster even as other consumer spending is crimped by the damage to household balance sheets  which effect would predominate in terms of overall aggregate demand is not entirely clear
exhibit 3 focuses on business fixed investment  as shown in the top left panel sales of medium and heavy trucks have more or less fallen off a cliff thus far this year reflecting the influence of new epa regulations that took effect on january 1 and this has been an important factor holding down overall equipment spending  we think that this dynamic should be coming to a close over the next few months and are looking for truck purchases to begin trending up sometime during the second half of this year  as shown in the top right panel orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods hit an air pocket around the turn of the year apparently driven down in part by the trials of the motor vehicle and construction industries  however the orders and shipments data for march and aprilthe latest that were available to us when we were putting together the greenbook encouraged us to think that a rebound of at least modest proportions is in train and this mornings release came in close to our greenbook expectations  moreover surveys of business conditions including the two ordersbased indexes shown in the middle left panel  suggest that businesses concur that the situation has brightened somewhat in the past few months  as shown in the first line of the middle right panel we are projecting that over the next six quarters equipment investment will post respectableif unspectacularincreases  two of the variables conditioning that view appear at the bottom of the page  as shown on the left we expect real business output to grow a little more slowly over the forecast period than in the preceding few years suggestingall else being equalsomewhat more modest growth in investment than in earlier years  similarly as shown on the right we expect the user cost of capital for hightech equipment the red line to continue to decline at about the average pace of the past few years and we expect the user cost for nonhightech equipment the black line to be about unchanged much as it has been over the past year and a half  all in all these factors point to a steady outlook for business investment

exhibit 4 takes a slightly longer term perspective on the inflation outlook by comparing our current projection to the one that we had in the january greenbookthe last time you submitted projections for a monetary policy report  as shown in the top left panel since january we have revised up our nearterm forecast for overall pce price inflation but not our longerterm outlook  part of the nearterm revision is due to faster food price inflation the top right panelwhich in turn reflects among other things the greater pressure that ethanol production has placed not only on the price of corn but also the prices of other foods that are produced using corn as an input such as beef dairy and poultry  by the end of this year though we assume that the livestock and poultry sectors have adjusted to the higher level of corn prices so we have food prices coming back in line with core inflation  another part
of the upward surprise in overall pce inflation is due to a steeper climb in consumer energy pricesthe middle left panelreflecting crude oil prices that have been running about 10 per barrel above our january assumption and refinery outages that have kept utilization below typical levels  but as with food we have energy price increases moderating greatly over the projection period
excluding food and energythe middle right panelcore pce price inflation has looked a little tamer thus far this year than we expected in january  nonetheless our projection for core inflation next year is unrevised on net relative to the january greenbook  the absence of any net revision since january reflects a mix of considerations  for one thing not all the news related to inflation has been good both import andas i just notedenergy prices have been running higher than we expected and thus have been generating more upward pressure on inflation than we had foreseen  for another some of the recent good news seems likely to prove relatively short lived  for example as shown in the bottom left panel nonmarketbased prices which account for about 20 percent of the core index have been rising less quickly thus far this year than we expected in january  historically however fluctuations in nonmarket prices have not conveyed much information about the future behavior of this series so we have trimmed our projection for the increase in this component of prices over the second half of this year by only a tenth  as shown to the right both tenants rentthe black lineand owners equivalent rent or oerthe red linehave decelerated lately but as shown by the bars at the bottom of the panel oer has slowed by noticeably more  historically differences of this magnitude have not persisted longsee for example the bulge that emerged and then disappeared in 2003 moreover these divergences have tended to be resolved in favor of tenants rent  accordingly we expect the increases in oer over the projection period to look more like the recent increases in tenants rent rather than the other way around  in the end these influences happen to roughly offset one another leaving our core inflation projection for next year unchanged from january
exhibit 5 focuses on the recent behavior of inflation expectations and as noted in the top left panel asks whether those expectations have moved above levels that were typical from mid1996 through mid2004a period when actual core pce inflation was mostly between 1 percent and 2 percent  as noted in the last bullet in the box the answer varies by series  in the next three panels i use shaded bands to indicate levels of each series that were typical during the eightyear reference periodthe darker bands marking the middle 50 percent of the series observations and the lighter bands marking the middle 80 percent of the observations  as shown in the top right panel the shortterm expectations measure from the michigan survey of households has indeed been tending to run above the levels that were typical of the earlier period  roughly those higher readings seem to reflect the steep climb in
energy prices over the past few years  in contrast as shown in the middle left panel longerterm inflation expectations from that survey have remained remarkably stable  they have drifted slightly higher relative to the levels that were typical during the reference period but even so the latest reading sits just at the edge of its 50 percent band  the middle right panel shows a measure of shortterm inflation expectations from the philadelphia feds survey of professional forecasters the most recent reading on this series is near the center of its 50 percent band  as you know the measure of tenyear expectations from the spf not shown has mostly been stuck at 25 percent since 1998 and was slightly below that in both the first and the second quarters of this year  unfortunately the tips market is too young to allow an applestoapples comparison on the basis used here  on the whole however we interpret the evidence as suggesting that inflation expectations have been quite stable recently  we assume that they will remain so over the projection period and thus will not be an important influence on the inflation contour this year and next  the bottom left panel plots our projection of the unemployment rate and our estimate of the nairu  we expect the small amount of upward pressure currently being generated from this source to be relieved over the projection period as the unemployment rate drifts up and resource utilization eases  the bottom right panel summarizes our inflation outlook  relative to the may greenbook our forecast for core pce inflation in 2007 as a whole is down 03 percentage point as i noted earlier our forecast for the second half of this year and for next year is down only a tenth nellie will continue our presentation
ms liang  the next four exhibits focus on financial conditions in the corporate and household sectors  as shown by the black line in the top left panel of exhibit 6 operating earnings per share for sp 500 firms for the second quarter are currently forecasted by analysts to be up about 5 percent from a year ago a deceleration from the 9 percent pace in the first quarter however in view of the sparseness of earnings warnings thus far we expect secondquarter earnings to top analysts forecasts by a few percentage points as noted to the right for the year as a whole analysts are forecasting
8 percent growth in earnings per share eps not very different from the blue chip consensus and the staffs forecast  for 2008 however analysts appear to anticipate that eps growth will pick up to 11 percent whereas we project that profits will flatten as margins get squeezed by rising unit labor costs
even adjusting for a typical bias in analysts views our outlook is a little more guarded
the middle panels use analysts forecasts to assess equity valuations  as shown by the blue line in the left panel the trendforward earningstoprice ratio for sp 500 firms has stayed near its level of the past several years and the gap between it and the real treasury perpetuity yieldthe equity premium shown by the shaded areanarrowed a touch in the past few months as yields rose  but the premium remains close to its average of the past twenty years
suggesting perhaps that investors still are mindful of the risks of investing in equities  however this caution seems to be less the case for smaller stocks as shown to the right a simple metric of valuationthe forward price earnings ratioshows that valuations of smaller companies the red line are on the high side of their range of the past two decades  relative to valuations of larger firms shown by the blue line smallcap valuations also appear on the high side  as shown by the red line in the bottom left panel risk spreads for highyield bonds have fallen on net in recent quarters and currently stand near record lows  to assess the risk premium on highyield bonds we subtract from this spread the compensation for expected losses from defaults that would be required by riskneutral investors  as shown by the black line expected losses have been low for the past few years and the risk premium the gray shaded area is narrow at about 120 basis points  low risk spreads and risk premiums may be supported by the exceptional quality of corporate balance sheets  as shown to the right the ratio of debt to assets for publicly traded speculativegrade firms the red line is just off its twentyyear low
the ratio for investmentgrade firms the black line continues to edge down
exhibit 7 examines corporate leverage  some analysts have expressed concern that low risk spreads are encouraging firms to ramp up debt which will lead to a sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality in the future  as shown by the green bars in the top left panel share repurchases have risen sharply since 2003 far outpacing the rise in dividend payments the blue bars cashfinanced acquisitions including leveraged buyouts lbos the yellow bars have also risen  the table to the right characterizes the effects of large repurchases on leverage in 2005 and 2006  firms with large repurchases defined as more than 5 percent of assets had earnings that equaled 9 percent of assets row 1 higher than earnings of 6 percent at firms with limited or no repurchases  row 2 shows that highrepurchase firms boosted their debt ratios 2 percentage points in contrast to the decrease of 1 percentage point at other firms  even so the increase raised the debt ratio to only 22 percent at largerepurchase firms below the average for other firms  thus repurchases to date do not suggest material damage to credit quality and would seem likely to do so going forward only if firms were pressured to continue to pay out cash despite weaker profits
lbos tend to involve much more debt than share repurchases as firms typically have debttoasset ratios of more than 65 percent right after an lbo as shown in the middle left panel the issuance of speculativegrade bonds for mergers and acquisitions including lbos the dark portion of the bars has risen notably and originations of speculativegrade loans for ma shown to the right have shot up  the sharp rise in loans reflects in part greater demand particularly for collateralized loan obligations clos by institutional investors who are estimated to have purchased more than half of these loans last year  one reason for the greater demand could be the relatively attractive riskreturn tradeoff of loans relative to bonds illustrated in the bottom left
panel  returns on leveraged loans in recent years the black line are only modestly lower than returns on highyield bonds the red line but are significantly less volatile  thus as noted in the inset box sharpe ratios defined as mean excess returns to standard deviationare higher for loans than for bonds  we expect that institutional investors will continue to pursue loans until expected returns decline perhaps through tighter spreads or lower recovery rates on loans  financial data generally are not available for firms taken private views of examiners and rating agencies can be used to gauge  the effect of lbos on credit quality  as shown by the black line in the right panel the most current and still preliminary reading on the share of syndicated loans outstanding that were adversely rated shows almost no change from the previous year and remains low  for corporate bonds the share rated b minus and below the red line stayed in its recent range at the end of the first quarter  although these measures provide a bit of comfort it may take some years to fully assess whether the operating efficiencies attained through lbos will be sufficient to cover the higher debt obligations
exhibit 8 focuses on household financial conditions  as shown in the top left panel the ratio of net worth to income is estimated to be up on net through the current quarter largely on stock market gains  while we expect this ratio to decline in coming quarters as house prices flatten and stock prices advance more slowly it remains high by historical standards  moving to the right panel delinquency rates on consumer loans at banks auto loans at finance companies and most mortgages have edged up in recent months but do not suggest signs of stress  overall most households appear to be in good financial shape  however there are strains among some subprime mortgage borrowers  as can be seen in the middle left panel delinquency rates on subprime adjustablerate mortgages the solid red line have climbed sharply and in april moved up again while those on other mortgages have remained low  as shown to the right earlypayment delinquency ratesat least three missed payments within six months of originationon adjustablerate loans rose further in april though they remain modest for prime and nearprime types the blue line  as shown in the bottom left panel we estimate that new foreclosures were started at an annual rate of 13 million in the first quarter
subprime mortgages the red bars accounted for more than half of the starts as noted to the right foreclosure starts in states with high unemployment like ohio michigan and indiana continued at a high rate but were little changed from the fourth quarter  the sharpest increases were in four states california florida nevada and arizonaaccounting for more than the nationwide increase as house prices in those states decelerated  to predict foreclosure starts we have developed a model of national rates that regresses statelevel rates on house price growth unemployment the share of loans that are subprime interest rates and other variables  this model predicts that foreclosures will continue to rise and reach a bit more than 14 million for 2007 as a whole and 15 million in 2008 under the greenbook assumption that national house prices will be roughly flat this year and next

there is unusual uncertainty right now about a forecast given the unprecedented reach of the subprime market in recent years  some sources of that uncertainty are discussed in exhibit 9  the top four panels present information on interest rate resets on subprime adjustablerate mortgages based on a very recently acquired dataset of more than 2 million 228 and 327 loans that were outstanding as of march of this year  as shown in the top left panel we estimate that as of the end of the first half of this year 36 percent of the loans have already had their first interest rate reset  another 25 percent will face their first reset in the second half of this year and 21 percent will do so in the first half of 2008  characteristics of interest rate resets for this snapshot of mortgages are noted in the right panel  the data indicate that for mortgages close to their first reset date the initial rate averages about
735 percent  most contracts specified the fully indexed rate as the six month libor plus a margin which averages 6 percent and most had caps on the size of each adjustment
the diagram at the middle left presents a progression of interest rates that borrowers about to reset likely will face based on mortgages that were reset in the past year  as shown by the red line a slightly stylized version of the actual data the gray line the jump in the rate at the first reset date is sizable almost 2 percentage points resulting in a new rate of 9 percent  the first reset rate almost never jumps to the fully indexed rate the blue horizontal  line because of the various caps on increases  but rates are subsequently  reset every six months and as shown on the second reset date the rate rises another 1 percentage point  our data suggest that a borrower would not reach the fully indexed rate in the original mortgage until twentyfour months after the first reset not shown  as noted to the right however many borrowers historically have refinanced their mortgages before the first reset date or shortly thereafter  in our sample 25 percent of mortgages had one reset and only 12 percent had a second reset
the expected resets in coming months highlight a risk to the outlook for subprime credit quality  fewer borrowers currently have the ability to refinance because of less home equity accumulation higher interest rates and tighter credit conditions  however many lenders are working with borrowers to modify their loans  in addition our most recent data indicate that while credit conditions have tightened financing remains available  as shown in the bottom left panel spreads on new subprime mbs issues have eased from their peaks in april although they have moved up in recent weeks triggered by concerns related to losses at bear stearnss hedge funds  subprime mortgage originations the full height of the bars in the right panel while down substantially from record highs in late 2005 are not inconsiderable
moreover funds appear to have been available both for refinancings the blue bars and for home purchases the green bars  my colleague mike leahy will continue
mr leahy  as you know from the greenbook recent news on foreign economic activity has been generally upbeat supporting our view that growth abroad will continue at a solid pace  the top panel of exhibit 10 shows our weighted average of total foreign gdp growth and our outlook  if our forecast is borne out foreign growth will soften slightly over the forecast period to about 3 percent which is also our current best guess of the rate of foreign potential growth  as you can see from  the chart rates of growth of 3 percent the thin horizontal line or better are not unprecedented but a stretch of five consecutive years like that from 2004 to 2008 would be unusual  the chart also shows foreign growth maintaining most of the momentum it developed over the past couple of years even as us growth has taken a more substantial step down  this is also a bit unusual  however as shown in the middle left panel foreign domestic demand gained strength throughout the current expansion leaving foreign economies less dependent on demand from the united states  foreign investment spending in particular has been picking up as shown to the right fixed investment spending as a share of gdp has moved up a couple of percentage points since 2003
with foreign activity expanding slightly faster than potential it is not surprising that we are seeing signs in some foreign economies that labor market slack is dwindling  the unemployment rate in japan shown in the bottom left panel is at a nineyear low in canada the rate is at a thirtyyear low and the euroarea rate is also at a multiyear low  tight labor market conditions are less apparent in emerging market economies although we are hearing stories of labor shortages in certain sectors in china where growth has been extremely rapid
what is more apparent is that in markets for oil and other primary commodities shown in the bottom right panel demand has outstripped available supply driving prices higher  supply capacity is expanding however and we are projecting consistent with futures markets that commodity prices will flatten out by the end of the forecast period  before they do our forecast calls for oil prices to rise a bit further over the remainder of 2007 and 2008  food commodity prices are projected to move slightly higher on average as well in part as energyrelated demand for grains remains strong  if this forecast is realized oil and energy prices should impart in coming quarters noticeable but only moderate upward pressure on headline consumer price inflation abroad  in part this is because the projected increase in oil prices is relatively modest at least compared with what weve seen in recent years
in addition the direct effect of oil prices on consumer prices in many cases is damped by tax structures or moreactive government intervention in energy markets
the top panels of exhibit 11 which examine the passthrough of crude oil prices to gasoline prices provide some evidence of how such passthrough varies across countries  these panels present localcurrency prices of unleaded gasoline and imported crude oil over the past couple of years or so plotted on a ratio scale so that vertical distances correspond to percent changes in prices  looking across the panels you can see that the price of imported crude oil in local currencythe black line at
the bottom of each panelmoves similarly across countries  in contrast the prices that consumers pay at the pumpthe red linesare less volatile in the foreign economies shown than in the united states and have moved up more slowly  in part this reflects some differing movements in refinery and distribution margins which are represented by the gap between imported crude oil prices and retail gasoline prices excluding taxes the blue lines  this is most noticeable for japan where margins are proportionally higher and more of the increase in crude oil prices was absorbed than in the united states and the other countries  in addition higher gasoline taxes abroad have inserted a greater wedge between the pretax price and the retail price of gasolinethe difference between the blue and the red lines  accordingly increased crude oil prices have pushed up retail gasoline prices proportionally less abroad than in the united states
the middle left panel presents some calculations of the rates at which the changes in crude oil prices were passed through to the retail gasoline prices between september 2004 and march of this year the most recent observation i have for these countries  during this period rates of passthrough were lower abroad particularly for japan and germany the countries with relatively high taxes  the smaller pass through of oil prices to retail gasoline prices abroad has also shown through to broader measures of consumer energy prices  as shown to the right consumer energy prices in canada germany and japan have increased less than those in the united states over the past four years  an extra factor holding down energy price inflation in canada over this period was the substantial appreciation of the canadian dollar which made imported energy relatively cheaper  overall this suggests that the effects of past increases in global energy prices on headline inflation as well as on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations were likely smaller abroad than in the united states
in many emerging market economies gasoline and other retail energy prices are controlled or subsidized so that energyrelated fluctuations in consumer prices if they occur at all tend to be gradual  for this group of economies what has left a bigger imprint on headline consumer price inflation in recent months is the global rise in food prices  the black line in the bottom left panel shows that food price inflation in mexico has been heavily influenced in recent years by enormous weatherinduced swings in domestic tomato price inflation shown in red of course  laughter  this year however food price inflation has not followed tomato price inflation down
rather it has been sustained in part by a sharp acceleration in prices of tortillas and other corn products shown by the green line which are responding to the fuelrelated surge in the global price of corn  food price inflation in china shown to the right in black has also been boosted by higher grain prices as higher feed costs along with an outbreak of swine flu have driven up meat and poultry prices  prices for corn and other grains are forecast to level out by the end of 2008 after they have increased enough to align supply and demand growth  a risk of course is that further rapid expansion of demand might continue to outstrip that of supply making food price inflation more persistent and more likely to spur inflation in other sectors  the bank of mexico cited such a risk following its policy tightening in april and chinas
authorities have raised concerns that food prices may exert upward pressure on wages
evidence for emerging market economies that inflation pressures might already be spreading outside the food and energy sectors is limited so far however  the top left panel of exhibit 12 shows core inflation rates in four of our largest emerging market trading partners  chinas core rate in blue which excludes only food shows no sign of wider inflation pressures  in brazil inflation has declined substantially over the past few years despite a slight uptick recently  core inflation in korea has been trending upward but it is still low  mexicos core inflation rate has edged up toward 4 percent a rate that concerns mexican authorities but this upward trend may merely reflect the fact that core inflation in mexico does not exclude processed food such as corn tortillas  the advanced foreign economies appear to be exhibiting more broadly based inflation pressures  as shown on the right in canada the euro area and the united kingdom core inflation has been on a rising trend since the middle of 2006 or earlier  in response the central banks in all three economies as well as the bank of japan are expected to tighten policy in the near term  core inflation is still in generally acceptable ranges however except perhaps for the bank of japan for which it might be too low and market sentiment does not indicate concern that inflation pressures are going to rise substantially  as you can see from the middle left panel tenyear government bond yields in the major markets have all risen since the beginning of the year  except for japan most of the increases in nominal yields the first column can be attributed to higher real yields shown in the second which is consistent with stronger prospects for growth  the table to the right shows that survey measures of inflation expectations for the year 2007 rose moderately for canada between december and june and a bit less for the united kingdom whereas the measures fell off some for the euro area and japan  longerrun inflation expectations as of the most recent survey date in april were still locked in at rates consistent with inflation targets in canada the euro area and the united kingdom
our outlook for headline inflation abroad shown in the bottom panels reflects a diminishing inflationary impulse from oil and other primary commodity prices as they flatten out over the forecast period  it also incorporates the view that some further monetary policy tightening will be needed to restrain domestic demand and guide inflation in each economy toward its price stability objective by the end of the forecast period

your last two international exhibits focus on the extent to which external adjustment is under way  a little more than a year ago in may was the last time we forecast that the us current account deficit in 2007 would exceed 1 trillion  since then as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 13 our outlook for the current account has improved substantially so much so that currently we dont see the deficit reaching 1 trillion within our forecast period  as shown to the right much of the improvement has come through an improved outlook for the trade balance  what surprised us  two likely suspects fail to provide the answer  given the recent strength of foreign growth one might have thought that a year ago we were perhaps too pessimistic on foreign activity and consequently undershot on us export
performance  however as shown in the middle left panel our outlook today for foreign economic activity is very similar to what we had in mind a year ago
similarly the decline over the past year in the broad real dollar shown to the right which has helped curb the deterioration in the trade balance has turned out to be not much different from our forecast a year ago  part of the answer it turns out is that even though the assumptions we fed our model for exports have not proved much off the mark our model forecast for core exports shown at the bottom left failed to catch the unusually strong growth of exports in 2006  we attribute this miss to the composition of foreign demand rather than its overall magnitude  as shown in the table to the right the largest contributors to growth of us core exports in 2006 were in the categories of capital goods line 2 and industrial supplies line 3  with capital goods making up a large fraction of core exports the rise in foreign investment as a share of gdp mentioned earlier likely provided a boost to core exports above that indicated by our aggregate measure of foreign gdp  similarly the global commodity boom likely favored us exports of industrial supplies
additional factors behind the improved outlook for the us current account are described in exhibit 14  one is the lower path of us real gdp shown in the top left panel which prompted real imports of core goods shown to the right to expand along a shallower trajectory than we had predicted last year  a third factor illustrated in the middle left panel is that we did not forecast the dip in the price of oil in the second half of 2006 which reduced the value of oil imports substantially  these  three factors explain the bulk of the upward adjustment in our forecast for the trade balance in 2007  in addition the improved outlook for the current account reflects an upward revision to net investment income shown in the middle right  this adjustment results from a number of factors including new data on us holdings of direct investment abroad new procedures for determining interest payments to foreign holders of us treasuries and a change in the methodology used to record interest flows on crossborder holdings of other fixedincome securities  as a result of these surprises the external accounts have clearly improved  going forward we expect the current account deficit to resume widening nonetheless as interest payments on the net external debt mount  but the combination of solid demand driven foreign growth and weaker us growth has led the external accounts to make a more positive contribution to us gdp growth in the near term as shown in the table  in our current forecast shown in the rightmost column we project that the arithmetic contribution of real net exports to gdp growth should be roughly neutral starting in the second half of this year as strong foreign growth helps sustain real export gains that match those of real imports
chairman bernanke  thank you  that was an excellent report  we have
time now for some questions for our colleagues  any questions  president lockhart
mr lockhart  aircraft constitute what share of capital goods exports and
might they have something to do with the competitive situation particularly between
boeing and airbus
mr leahy  aircraft are an important factor in this  in the fourth quarter of
last year boeing was essentially exporting all the aircraft it could produce so coming
into the first quarter we didnt get much more because there werent any more to sell
but that issue has been important  i dont know to what extent boeing has benefited
from the fact that airbus has had some hard times but i suspect it has gotten some
benefit from that
ms johnson  aircraft are roughly 5 percent of exports
mr lockhart  five percent of capital goods or of total exports
ms johnson  more like 20 percent of capital goods and 5 percent of exports
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i want to take david back to exhibit 5 and try to pin him down
although i am not very hopeful  laughter  you took us back to the period from 1996 to
mid2004 in which inflation by the core pce measure was between 1 and 2 almost all
the timei think the only exception was basically the last few months of 2001  core
inflation averaged something like 16 percent  you take these three survey measures
there and look at them  what i took away from your assessment was that you view these
as roughly consistent with that period  is that fair
mr wilcox  i would say that the answer differs by series so that if you tend
to favor the shortterm michigan series shown in the top right you might get a more
alarming picture  but for example the survey of professional forecasters tenyear
ahead series is all the way at the other end of the spectrum having been essentially rock
solid at 25 percent and these other series fall somewhere in between  obviously this
analysis is extraordinarily simple and doesnt take into account other factors that may
have been at work over that eightyear reference period that are not operating now  but
the hope was that on a very rough and ready basis this might be broadly indicative and
that an eightyear period might capture some variation in other factors that were
influencing inflation
mr lacker  i am wholly on board with you there  what i was most curious
about was what you took away from this for your core inflation outlook which you have
going to 20 real soon and staying there and whether you view current expectations as
broadly similar to this period and your forecast as consistent with that period  or do you
view expectations and your forecast as potentially at variance with that period or some
combination of the two
mr wilcox  i think we view the current constellation of expectations
measures as not providing much impetus either upward or downward on inflationit is
just not going to be an important factor shaping the contour of inflation in our view
mr lacker  okay  a question i hadand maybe vince can help with this
is that the tips measures obviously dont go back that far and going back only as far as
they go my sense is that most analysts dont view them in the earliest period in which we
have quotations as representing prices and markets liquid enough to give us a sense  i
guess 2003 is around the borderline of the reliability period  in 2003 those tips spreads
for the next five years were down well into the 1 to 2 percent range very close to
1 percent  do you folks view the tips spreads in the year or two leading to 2003 as
something out of which we should take any information about inflation expectations
mr wilcox  well there is a picture in the lower right panel of chart 1 in the
bluebook
mr lacker  it goes back only to 04 doesnt it
mr wilcox  yes that is right
mr lacker  well i was looking at greenbook part 2 page ii35 and it goes
back to 01
mr wilcox  in my conversations with some of the tips analysts on our staff
they suggested as consistent with your statement that 2003 was roughly speaking the
period in their view in which the tips market emerged into the modern era with some
tighter pricing
mr lacker  so there is some informational content there  are you giving me
some comfort in that regard
mr wilcox  yes
mr reinhart  i think the thing to note president lacker is that if you look
at the term structure of tips compensation the fiveyear fiveyearforward in that has
been a whole lot more stable  the quotes you are looking at are very much influenced by
the first five years  in fact at the end of 2001 again in 2002 and in the middle of 2003
the first five years inflation compensation fell below 1 percent
mr lacker  the tips spread measure
mr reinhart  yes the tips inflationcompensation measure  during the
same period however the fiveyear fiveyearforward basically bounced up and down
around 2 percent
mr lacker  right  so the longerrun expectations maybe werent so
anchored or werent tied to the middle of this period  but we had a period in which there
was an indication that expectations over the near term were around 1  i guess the thing
i would be curious about and maybe vinces presentation is a more appropriate time to
address this questioni would be happy to defer it until thenis that viewing 1996 to
2003 as sort of a distinct period in which we nailed things between 1 and 2 for a while
suggests thinking about the transition from 03 forward a couple of years as a transition
out of price stability defined that way and whether we can take any lessons from that for
the potential costs of a transition back to a period like that
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman  i just wanted to thank mike in particular for that
excellent presentation on the international dimension of this  it was sterling or euro or
whatever the expression would be in terms of its excellence  i have a tutorial question
about the export figures  i assume services are not included in core exports  is that
correct
mr leahy  no that is just goods
mr fisher  are our service exports increasing more rapidly than our non
service exports  do you know  would they be a possible source of explanation for the
improved trade balance
mr leahy  they are a possible source  they were my fourth factor if i had
gone on longer  laughter  they were neck and neck with the oil imports in terms of
their contribution to the improved outlook for trade
mr fisher  well thank you  that was an excellent presentation
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  just a question about scaleregarding exhibit 8 serious
mortgage delinquency rateswhen you refer to adjustable rates going to almost
12 percent of loans is that of adjustablerate loans  what is the total dollar value the
10 percent is against
ms liang  the serious delinquency rate is for the pool of adjustablerate
subprime loans and they represent about 9 percent of the outstanding mortgages
mr hoenig  okayand the total outstanding mortgages are what dollar
amount
ms liang  there is 10 trillion in mortgages outstanding
mr hoenig  that is what i thought  i just wanted to make sure  thank you
vice chairman geithner  but to make sure that is right the red lines are
subprime
ms liang  the red lines are subprime
vice chairman geithner  subprime are
ms liang  subprime adjustablerate loans are about 9 percent of outstandings
and subprime fixed loans are another 5 percent of outstandings  that would be 9 percent
of the 10 trillion in total mortgages
chairman bernanke  although the percentages are by number of
mortgages rather than by value i think
ms liang  by dollar it is very similar
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  president moskow
mr moskow  also on exhibit 8 the net worth chart in the top lefthand
corneri thought i heard you say that this was high by historical standards  so there are
two things herethe stock market has been strong and then housing prices have been
very weak  i assume if you run this out into another year the line is going to keep going
down as well  i was just wondering if you could expand on this  is this higher than you
expected it to be at this particular time
ms liang  if we had started this series in the early 90s this would be the
high  we have the stock market bubble of 2000 in here and it has come off but it is 5
even at the end of the projection period it is 5 times disposable income  that is
historically high  before 96 it would have been about 3 or 4
mr stockton  we do indeed forecast it to continue to decline over the next
year or so in large measure because as david shows in his chart we still think this house
price adjustment has to proceed further before we get into a better equilibrium  our
assumption on the stock price of course is pretty neutral because we have it going up
pretty close to the overall rate of nominal income so i think the downward tilt is being
driven mostly by the house price story
mr moskow  on a longerterm trend basis where would you expect it to
stabilize or to level out
mr stockton  take this for what it is worth which isnt a whole lot
laughter  thank you  it drops just a bit it is between 5 and 5 over the longer haul
and just gradually declines back in that direction
chairman bernanke  president hoenig i think i interrupted you  im
sorry
mr hoenig  this is the number of loansthen do you have any idea what the
percentage of the dollar amount of loans is in delinquency
ms liang  we think there is probably 900 billion to 1 trillion in adjustable
rate subprime mortgages outstanding
mr hoenig  so about the same  okay
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  i wasnt sure i heard correctly  what was the average ratio of
wealth to disposable income over the 90s roughly
chairman bernanke  the number i recall is 46 as the longrun average
since the 80s  president stern
mr stern  i want to go back to the surprise in net exports once again  i dont
quite remember the argument but it seems to me we used to worry a lot about small
foreign elasticities of demand for us goods and services when the dollar declined or
when income growth differentials changed  has what we have seen lately affected your
view about that
mr leahy  i would say it hasnt affected our view in the sense that we havent
changed the elasticities that we are using on the basis of this one years observation but it
points in the right direction  i mean we are getting a little bit more umph from foreign
growth than we thought before  whether it is going to be a onetime miss related to
aircraftthere was some temporary investment surge in foreign economies and we are a
capital goods exporter and we are just taking advantage of that and it is going to go
backor whether it persists is a little too early to tell  but it is possible
ms johnson  we have updated the elasticities since ten years ago  when you
first heard us nattering on about the unsustainability of the us current account situation
we had perhaps a more extreme view of those elasticities  if you drop out the 1970s and
you restrict your estimates to a more recent period you tend to get elasticities that move
toward each other a little  but the basic asymmetry is still there and we havent
responded to 2006 in some specific way  were letting a little more time go by to see
what happens going forward
mr stern  thanks
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  in exhibit 9 the average initial rate on the stock of mortgages
that you are looking at for resetting over the next couple of years is about 7 percent
what is roughly the current rate for subprime fixedrate loans
ms liang  it is around 9 percent  if you get on the internet and try to find a
subprime fixedrate loan it would be about that  we cant find an official series but
roughly 9
mr kroszner  so they are facing a 2 percent payment shock if they stick
with the mortgage  but if they were able to switch to a fixedrate product it is about
1 percent
ms liang  thats right right now
mr kroszner  thank you
chairman bernanke  if there are no other questions vincent could i call
on you to talk about the economic projections
mr reinhart3  sure  thank you mr chairman  as was evident in the survey responses summarized in the memo of june 15 on your attitudes toward the economic projections there seems to be broad agreement among you on the key features of the process  where there was not including about sharing forecasts the specification of the monetary policy assumption and the characterization of uncertainty the subcommittee on communications tried to find common ground the result was reflected in the survey on the economic outlook for this meeting which i will discuss with the aid of the material distributed with the cover economic projections of fomc participants
as can be seen by comparing the bolded with the italicized numbers in the first exhibit there were only minor changes in your projections of real gdp growth the unemployment rate and core pce inflation over the next two and onehalf years from those you submitted in may  given the favorable data over the intermeeting period you raised your real growth forecasts a notch and lowered the core pce inflation forecasts for 2007  still as plotted in the top panel of exhibit 2 the red bars showing the central tendency of your forecasts indicate that most of you anticipate that gdp growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit over 2008 and 2009
although the submissions were not specific about potential output growthand not all of you would agree that it is even a useful conceptthis expansion of real output would seem initially to be slower than that of capacity in that the central tendency for the unemployment rate the second panel edges higher  with resource markets less taut and perhaps some transitory factors ebbing core pce inflation the third panel drifts down  in this experiment you were asked for inflation readings coming from two measurement systems  the historical wedge between inflation measured by the core pce price index and the total consumer price index is about  percentage point the central tendency projections for those two series in 2008 and 2009 are about that far apart leading to the inference that you are not forecasting significant changes to the relative prices of energy and food  the subcommittee suggested forecasting these two inflation series in the spirit of experimentation  sometime in the next two days you might want to express how useful you found that part of the experiment
another notable feature of your projections is that the differences among them widen rather than narrow the further into the future you forecast  this suggests a diversity of views as to key attributes of the economy as well as where you believe inflation should be headed in the long run  as for the assumption about monetary policy underlying these outcomes about twothirds of you indicated general agreement with the path laid out in the greenbook  as for the others there were explanations advanced for being on either side of the staff assumption

you were also asked to provide a qualitative characterization of your uncertainty about your outlook  the results for real gdp growth are given in the top panel of exhibit 3  somewhat surprisingly there was no lake wobegon effect and the preponderance of responses viewed the real gdp growth outlook as just about as uncertain as has been the case on average over the past twenty years  as shown in the bottom panel a majority of the submissions indicated that the risks around the projections for gdp growth are judged to be broadly balanced  this contrasts with the indication in the may minutes that although the risks to economic activity had diminished slightly they were still weighted to the downside  for some the incoming news may have led to a reassessment of the risks to economic growth  for others it may reflect a view that the main downside risks to activity are concentrated in the near term and those risks further ahead are broadly symmetric  to shed light  on this issue participants might want to address the main risks to economic growth and whether they are still judged to be weighted to the downside as had been the case in your may discussion
some more detail about your forecasts of the unemployment rate is provided in exhibit 4  a majority of the projections embody a more muted rise in the unemployment rate than in the greenbook forecast the dashed vertical lines this smaller expected increase may partly reflect the stronger outlook for gdp growth suggested by many of your projections  but then again it may not  laughter from the comments in the narratives about the likely strength of trend growth it is not clear that the projected growth in output relative to trend is expected to be materially more robust than that suggested by the staffs forecast  does the more modest projected rise in unemployment reflect a difference in views from the staffs about the rate of growth of potential output the unemployment rate associated with no change in the inflation rate cyclical movements in productivity or other factors
exhibit 5 provides a tally of the yearbyyear inflation outlook  a majority of the projections have a more benign mediumterm outlook for core inflation than that suggested by the staffs forecast  but the responses to the question about the appropriate path of interest rates indicate that for a majority of projections this does not stem from a significantly tighter stance of monetary policy than assumed by the staff  likewise the projections for gdp growth and unemployment do not appear to imply greater economic slack than expected by the staff  for some this more marked moderation in inflation may reflect a judgment that more of the rise in core inflation reflects the effect of temporary influences such as the rise in energy prices and owners equivalent rent that are likely to abate over the forecast period  for others it may reflect an assessment that the nairu is lower than that assumed by the staff or that inflation expectations may edge lower over the forecast period perhaps pulled down by federal reserve communications  you might wish to exchange views about the main factors contributing to the expected moderation in inflation in your forecasts
as to where inflation is headed in the longer run many of you indicated that the thirdyear projections the bottom panel reflect to a considerable degree your policy goal rather than initial conditions  if that is the case the central tendency reveals that most of you individually define the inflation rate that best fosters the dual mandate to be 1 to 2 percent when measured by the core pce inflation rate  given your apparent beliefs about future movements in the relative prices of food and energy discussed earlier you would also seem to think that total pce inflation should place within a range of 1 to 2 percent
as for the process from here on if you would like to change your forecast in light of the discussion at this meeting or data received since you prepared your projection we ask that you submit your revision to the secretariat by close of business friday
unless we are instructed differently as a result of the discussion tomorrow the staff will draft a minutesstyle narrative description of the economic projections  this will be a standalone document that will circulate with the draft minutes on the regular schedule as was the case in may
one last point  your final exhibit gives the traditional presentation of your economic projections that will be made public in the monetary policy report and included in the published minutes  if you want to change your submission please let us know by friday  how you judge the usefulness of this exhibit compared with the forecasts compiled for the experiment presumably will be one topic for discussion tomorrow  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you vincent  thanks for reminding us that
this projection counts in some sense right  laughter  also i think it is very useful for
us to have the discipline of thinking about how our projections fit together  are there
questions for vincent  if not then we can begin our economic goround  who would
like to go first  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  data relating to both economic
activity and inflation during the intermeeting period have been encouraging  economic
indicators have strengthened considerably and recent readings on core inflation have
been quite tame  although a portion of the recent deceleration of core prices likely
reflects transitory influences the underlying trend in core inflation is still quite favorable
i view the conditions for growth going forward as being reasonably solid  the main
negative factors are tied to housing  the latest data dont point to an imminent recovery
in this sector and i fear that the recent runup in mortgage rates will only make matters
worse  in addition housing prices are unlikely to rise over the next few years and
indeed may well fall and the absence of the housing wealth gains realized in the past
should damp consumption spending  i agree with the greenbook that the recent runup in
bond and mortgage rates reflects primarily a shift in market expectations for the path of
policy and therefore implies only a small subtraction to my forecast for growth in 2008
in my view the stance of monetary policy over the next few years should be
chosen to help move labor and product markets from being somewhat tight today to
exhibiting a modest degree of slack in order to help bring about a further gradual
reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability  the stance of
monetary policy will need to remain modestly restrictive along the lines assumed in the
greenbook and by markets in order to achieve that goal  my forecast is for growth to be
around 2 percent in the second half of this year and in 2008 slightly below my estimate
of potential growth and for the unemployment rate to edge up gradually reaching nearly
5 percent by the end of next year
under these conditions core inflation should continue to recede gradually with
the core pce price index increasing 2 percent this year and 19 percent in 2008  this
forecast is predicated on continued wellanchored inflation expectations and the eventual
appearance of a small amount of labor market slack  in addition special factors such as
rising energy prices and the sustained runup in owners equivalent rent that have boosted
inflation should ebb over time contributing a bit to the expected decline in core inflation
in terms of risks to the outlook for growth i still feel the presence of a 600pound
gorilla in the room and that is the housing sector  the risk for further significant
deterioration in the housing market with house prices falling and mortgage delinquencies
rising further causes me appreciable angst  indeed the repercussions of falling house
prices are already playing out in some areas where past price rises were especially rapid
and subprime lending soared  for example in the sacramento metropolitan area east of
san francisco house prices shot up at an annual rate of more than 20 percent from 2002
to 2005  since then however they have been falling at an annual rate of 3 percent
delinquencies on subprime mortgages rose sharply last year putting sacramento at the
top of the list of msas in terms of the changes in the rate of subprime delinquencies
research by my staff examining metropolitan areas across the country indicates
that the experience of sacramento reflects a more general pattern  they found that low
rates of house price appreciation and especially house price decelerations are associated
with increases in delinquency rates even after controlling for local economic conditions
such as employment growth and the unemployment rate  one possible explanation for
these findings is that subprime borrowers especially those with very low equity stakes
have less incentive to keep their mortgages current when housing no longer seems an
attractive investment either because prices have decelerated sharply or interest rates have
risen  these results highlight the potential risks that rising defaults in subprime could
spread to other sectors of the mortgage market and could trigger a vicious cycle in which
a further deceleration in house prices increases foreclosures in turn exacerbating
downside price movements
the risks to inflation are also significant  in addition to the upside risks
associated with continued tight labor markets a slowdown in productivity growth could
add to cost pressures  although recent productivity data have been disappointing i
expressed some optimism at the last meeting about productivity growth on the grounds
that at least some of the slowdown appeared to reflect labor hoarding and lags in the
adjustment of employment to output especially in the construction industry  data since
that meeting have reinforced my optimism concerning trend productivity growth  in
particular new data in the recently released business employment dynamics report
suggest that productivity growth may have been stronger than we have been thinking
this report which includes data that will be used in the rebenchmarking of the payroll
survey in january shows a much smaller increase in employment in the third quarter of
2006 than is reported in the payroll survey it therefore implies a larger increase in
output per worker
a second risk to inflation is slippage in the markets perceptions of our inflation
objective  although inflation compensation over the next five years is essentially
unchanged since our last meeting longrun breakeven inflation rates implied by the
difference between nominal and indexed treasury securities are up about 20 basis points
however our analysis suggests that this increase reflects in good part an elevation in risk
premiums or the influence of variouslet me call them idiosyncraticfactors of the
type that bill dudley mentioned such as a possible shift in the demand by foreign central
banks for treasuries or special factors affecting the demand for inflationindexed
securities and not an increase in longrun inflation expectations  we base this conclusion
on the fact that longrun breakeven inflation rates have also climbed in the united
kingdoma country where inflation expectations have been remarkably well anchored
over the past decade and where inflation has been trending downward  the fact that
breakeven inflation rates rose in both countries despite their different monetary policy
regimes suggests that a common explanation is needed rather than one specific to the
united states  i think this conclusion is supported by the board staff model that
attributes about half of the movement in breakeven inflation to risk premiums  that said
our understanding and estimates of risk premiums are imprecise so we must continue to
monitor inflation expectations very carefullyof course along with everything else
laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the seventh district
have changed little since my last report  overall activity in the district is lagging the
nation mainly because of the continued difficulties of what we now call the detroit
three formerly known as the big three laughter and their suppliers  but other sectors
of our region are doing betternotably a number of manufacturers outside autosand
consumer spending is moving forward at a moderate rate
looking at the outlook for the national economy the greenbook baseline forecast
has growth recovering to potential and core inflation stabilizing at 2 percent  our outlook
is not much different  we see growth returning close to potential  assuming that
monetary policy maintains its slightly restrictive stance we think inflation will edge a
shade below 2 percent by 2009  that would be a good outcome and i sure hope we get
it
the biggest news since the may fomc meeting is the adjustment in financial
conditions  the change in fed funds futures brings market expectations into better
alignment with what i think will be the appropriate path for monetary policy  im not
sure however how much restraint we can expect from the increase in longterm interest
rates  as the chairman heard from our directors last week the effects can be muted by
ample liquidity in the financial markets  one of our directors who heads a large private
equity firm says that he does not see much of a change in the lending environment
financing for even highrisk projects continues to be readily available at quite favorable
rates and terms  notably such loans are being made with few covenants and no
automatic default triggers
of course the housing market remains a risk  like the greenbook we continue
to expect large declines in residential investment through the end of this year and i
remain concerned that builders may need to cut back even more to reduce the high
inventory of unsold homes  our detroit branch director who is cfo of pulte homes
noted that twothirds of their sales usually occur between the super bowl and memorial
day  sales this year in that period were sluggish and relatively unresponsive to price
discounting  accordingly he is not looking for a turnaround in housing markets before
08  another director the head of us gypsum agreed that it would be 08 before we
could expect a pickup in housing
with regard to consumer spending more generally some contacts noted the
impact of higher gasoline prices  a developer of malls and shopping centers downgraded
his expectations for the rest of 2007 but he is not overly pessimistic and is expecting
retail sales in the second half to remain near their firsthalf pace  both gm and ford
believe that the higher gasoline prices are holding down the overall level of motor vehicle
sales in addition to moving the mix of sales away from suvs and toward cars  at this
point they believe that higher interest rates are having only a marginal effect on demand
both are predicting that total light vehicle sales will be about 165 million units in 2007
that is the same as the pace predicted by the participants in our annual outlook
symposium that we held in detroit earlier this month
but the rest of the manufacturing is doing better than autos  producers of heavy
machinery and agricultural equipment continue to report strong demand  the chicago
purchasing managers report which is confidential until its release this friday was 602
in june that reading is down only a bit from its very high one of 617 in may  some of
this strength reflects strong growth abroad which is fueling the demand for us
products as we talked about during the chart show  indeed i think that there may be
some upside risks to the gdp forecast from fasterthanexpected export growth  labor
markets continue to be strong and we heard the usual stories about selected labor
shortages and associated increases in wages  one exception is the soft demand for
temporary workers but this could be normal for a mature business cycle
turning to prices our contacts seem to be a bit more pessimistic about the
prospects for inflation  we heard concerns that higher energy prices would boost
transportation costs and that the demand for food stuffs from abroad and the booming
domestic ethanol market are pushing up food prices  in contrast to the anecdotes the
incoming data on core inflation were better than expected  our indicator models revised
down a tenth or two from the last round they now have core pce inflation being about
2 percent this year and next and then edging down to 18 or 19 in 2009  without any
meaningful resource slack this improvement would require a comparable adjustment in
inflation expectations which may be difficult given a prolonged period of core inflation
at or above 2 percent  so i continue to think that the predominant risk remains that
inflation will not moderate as expected
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the fifth districts economy has
picked up since the last meeting  retail sales rose briskly in june following several
months of flatness and shopper traffic increased more broadly as well  of particular
interest building supply and furniture retailers report better sales  bigticket sales remain
generally weak however with domestic brand automobile dealers continuing to note soft
sales  activity at district services firms added to an already healthy pace of growth with
revenues and employment expanding somewhat faster in june  in may our
manufacturing sector finally joined in the general manufacturing pickup that began a few
months back in other regions  our indexes for shipments and new orders swung well into
positive territory after having spent the entire year well down in the negative region  this
rebound appears to be broadly based with most industries posting stronger readings
housing sales and construction remain weak in most parts of the district though home
prices have been more resilient with very modest gains reported in most areas and lower
prices in only a few  in contrast the commercial real estate sector appears to be fairly
strong with both leasing and construction looking solid
regarding inflation our survey measures suggest that price trends in the services
sector remain moderate  our manufacturing numbers however consistent with president
moskows report of anecdotal information indicate significant price acceleration on both
the product and the input sides
at the national level the new information on the real economy we have received
since the last meeting has been fairly positive  in particular im heartened by the recent
reports on business investment and manufacturing which appear to confirm our
expectations that the softness we were seeing a few months ago would prove to be
transitory  consumer spending also continues to expand although not as rapidly as
earlier in the year  housing of course continues to be the main drag on spending and
the most prominent source of uncertainty about the real outlook  my sense is that the
uncertainty is receding however  construction numbers have more or less moved
sideways since the beginning of the year in contrast to the sharp fall we saw in the first
three quarters of last year  so it looks to me as though were nearing a bottom in housing
activity albeit a bottom that may slope gently away from the steep cliff we descended
last year  at this point i think the risk of encountering another cliff has become
relatively small
we have also received favorable readings on core inflation for the past three
months  this has brought the twelvemonth core pce number down to 20 percent
while this news is good we should react cautiously of course  we have seen several
months of favorable data before only to see several months of unfavorable numbers
moreover the greenbook points to a number of special factors suggesting that the second
quarters better inflation performance is likely to be transitory  i am inclined to agree
with that assessment and so i think we could well see core inflation rise again
measures of nearterm inflation expectations have not moved much in recent
months they all still point to pce inflation expectations of 2 percent or so  moreover
fiveyear fiveyearahead inflation compensation has moved up  percentage point for
whatever reason since just before our last meeting  all this makes it hard to be confident
that we are going to see a sustained decline of inflation below 2 percent anytime soon
the good news on the real side however suggests that we are making progress toward
seeing downside risks diminish enough for us to do something about inflation  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman for the sake of consistency i will refer to my
report at the last two meetings on what i call the goldilocks porridge classification
system  i reported last that the international economy was hot and it remains so as we
saw in the excellent slide presentation  i reported that the domestic economy was cold  i
believe it remains so in contrast i think to the previous two interventions at least from a
growth perspective  i also reported that the eleventh district home of the nba
champions vanquishers of theshall i say more cavalierfourth district laughter
was just right  it remained so in relative terms  i would say that it has weakened
somewhat and cooled somewhat in absolute terms
i just want to comment quickly on the international side of the domestic economy
with the hopes of adding on the margin to the staffs excellent work in the greenbook
the bluebook and the presentations we had earlier  on the international side i was
pleased that for the first time at least since i have been a member of this august body the
last minutes reported that the participants expressed some concern that the strength of
global demand could contribute to price pressures at home and noted heightened levels
of capacity utilization in those countries  we didnt talk about capacity utilization in
your excellent report  i just wanted to add that our work in dallas and my ceo contacts
continue to validate the phenomenon that we are getting closer to capacity constraints
abroad  research by the dallas staff imperfect as it is confirmed continued growth
overseas resulting in a tightening of capacity around the world as does the work of
jpmorgan one of the few places in the private sector that we find has spent a good deal
of time contemplating this issue
anecdotal reports from ceos and cfos confirm this trend  the rest of the world
is reported to be offering more fertile soil for growth and investment as i think president
moskow pointed out  shippers tell me that tonnage demand for dry bulk is running at a
rate significantly higher than last year driven by underlying demand outside the united
states and despite slower rates of growth of shipments to the united states  you also see
this in ship charter rates remaining high  freight rates which dont have a spot market
and are much more difficult to measure appear to be rising in terms of their volume
expansion and in shipments to europe from the pacificcertainly at a faster rate than
those shipments from the pacific to the united states
one of the largest engineering logistics firms in the world reports that with the
exception of downstream oil and gas investments power and an as yet unannounced
nuclear power plant that will be built in the united states their bookings and substantial
backlog are all driven by nonus demand with cost escalation not only of commodity
inputs but of the building blocks and their materials such as compressors and pumps and
so on despite the levelingoff of the price of steel  on the cost side the head of the
united states largest importer of consumer goodswithout mentioning the name of the
retail companylaughter reports that cost pressures as you indicated before in your
presentation coming from china are leading them to aggressively seek to shift imports
to other country sources in certain sectors china is becoming too pricey
at home business operators to whom i talked are more equivocal about growth
prospects for the economy mr chairman than i expected  the ceo of one of the
largest rails describes the economy as lethargic  the ceo of one of the largest it
firms doesnt see much sequential growth  the ceo of an airline which is not
southwest airlines says that domestically the seasonally adjusted revenue for the
industry line is flat  a usually ebullient ceo of one of the nations largest broadcasters
said that while q2 is always the slowest quarter this one is slower than normal  the
cfo of one of the flagship express shippers reports that b2c is growing at 3 to 4 percent
rates of volume expansion after several years of 7 to 8 percent rates of growth  but there
has been no pickup in the second quarter over the first quarter seasonally adjusted and it
just seems to be as flat as it can be across the board in all segments  a leading
restaurateur with thirty years in the business notes that he is experiencing a combination
of soft top line and rising costs for the first time in his history of operating  for added
measure the ceo of a very large retailer describes demand as flatter than a pancake
he and retailers at the higher price points report that shoppers are moving away from the
malls to closertohome retailers because of transportation costs and financial insecurity
they make fewer trips and they buy larger volumes per trip
president yellen i wont depress you with the soundings from the two largest
public homebuilders  i only half jokingly recommended that they take all sharp objects
off their desks and seal their windows  laughter  their situation is reported to have
gone from bad to worse  one of the interesting data points is that they represent
27 percent of the homebuilders  the remainder is in private developers hands  they
suggest that the rapidity with which those private developers report their stress is
certainly much less than the publicly held companies in part because they are afraid of
their lenders  therefore those shoes have yet to drop which is not an encouraging sign
on the price front i hear two common complaints across the board  first labor
remains tight and pricey except in the homebuilding sector where there has been some
relief for obvious reasons  secondand i think very importantlyfood prices driven by
corn oil are creating significant cost pressures for all crops including substitute crops
one of the most astute contacts i havea leading banker not a restaurateur or a food
personsays that adding ethanol to what he called a tectonic shift in demand for corn
wheat and other food stuffs stemming from the addition of two billion peoplenew
consumers moving up the food chain no pun intendedmay place corn at the center of
the inflation paradigm in the new century
one commonly voiced concern might influence business investment in capital
expenditures  i keep hearing from each ceo what are we going to do with our
capital  reports are increasing of competition from rates on the longer end of the yield
curve above 5 percent  boards of directors are reluctant to embrace the concept that
eighteen months out the us economys sun will shine more brightly than it is shining
currently and concerns linger about the costs and the availability of labor for domestic
capex purposes
in summary mr chairman statistically we may have a secondquarter snapback
driven by inventory adjustment as predicted by the board staff and by my own staff  but
my soundings with business leadersagain no doubt imperfectprovide some cognitive
dissonance  i didnt hear a single one of twentysix interlocutors who would agree with
the baseline case as stated in the greenbook  most would agree with the alternative cases
that were presented which were quite thoughtful  i used the term dyspeptic in
describing the mood of corporate leaders the last time we met  i would say the mood
mr chairman remains sour and perhaps it has become more sour  i remain relatively
pessimistic on growth and skeptical about inflation and the utility of reliance on the core
measurement in guiding our deliberations  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  regarding the national economy and
real growth it seems to me that recent developments are unfolding to a considerable
extent largely as anticipated  growth was positive but subdued over the four quarters
ending in the first quarter of this year  it apparently snapped back discernibly in the
current quarter and my forecast is for sustained growth around trend going forward  in
examining the twelvemonth period spanning the last three quarters of last year and the
first quarter of this year it is apparent that the slowing of aggregate demand went beyond
the housing sector and in fact was fairly broadly based  to be sure residential
construction activity contracted persistently and substantially over those four quarters  in
addition spending on equipment and software barely advanced federal government
outlays were soft in real terms and there was a significant inventory correction  in most
cases with the likely and perhaps obvious exception of residential construction there are
reasons to believe based on some of the indicators that david wilcox covered this
afternoon as well as materials distributed before the meeting that these components of
demandthat is spending on equipment and software federal government outlays and
inventorieswill strengthen going forward  i thought it was particularly heartening as
noted in part 2 of the greenbook that apparently the inventory overhang in construction
supplies and in autos has been worked off which suggests that we should see
improvement in those sectors going forward  as i have commented before at recent
meetings i think the outlook for nonresidential construction for net exports and for
consumer spending remains positive although not unduly exuberant  all of this fits
reasonably well with my view of what we should expect from productivity gains going
forward as well as increases in employment and hours worked  so overall i think the
outlook for the real economy is promising and favorable
as to inflation there has been as everybody has noted some moderation in the
core measures recently  i expect this performance to continue not necessarily on a
monthbymonth basis but over time  overall my reading of monetary policy is that it is
moderately restrictive  as a consequence that should feed into a further gradual
diminution of inflation along with ebbing of some of the transitory factors that pushed it
up for a time  i would add that anecdotes from our business contacts dont suggest any
changes in pricing power or acceleration of inflation at this point
now of course risks to the outlook abound as they always do and many have
already been mentioned  several relate of course to housingconstruction activity
home prices mortgagerelated paper and so forth  then you can add uncertainty
associated with energy prices the runup in longterm interest rates that has already
occurred and i am sure a few things that i havent enumerated  i wouldnt want to sound
overly complacent or sanguine but i would observe that many of these risks are not new
many of them are already built into the greenbook or other forecasts  in any event if
one of them were to occur in isolation i would doubt that it would have a profound effect
on the outlook that i have described  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you mr chairman  the pace of growth in new
england at least as measured by employment remains below that of the nation  indeed
since the trough of the last recession new englands jobs have grown at less than half
the pace of the nation as a whole  some of this is the traditionally slower pace of job
formation in the region and some is undoubtedly the result of the kind of industries
telecommunications and technology more generallythat were hardest hit in the 2001
recession and have yet to recover fully  but some of it also revolves around issues of
supply  almost every firm large or small comments on the difficulty of finding skilled
labor  there is also reason to believe that at least relative to the rest of the nation the
supply versus demand imbalance may be a particular issue in the region  this comes
from the conference boards online jobposting measure which for some time has
shown new england as having the highest number of advertised job openings relative to
the size of the labor force  contacts report that they are willing to offerand do offer
higher pay to get the skills they need but finding the workers is harder to do and takes
longer than earlier in the cycle
another issue that came up again in our round of contacts is the pervasive rise in
the cost of almost any metal but especially copper and aluminum  contacts at one very
large diversified company speculated about chinas stockpiling valuable metals
whatever the cause worldwide demand is strong and prices are rising for all types of
metal inputs  some firms report progress in passing on those price increases  indeed
larger manufacturing companies appear to be buoyed if not driven by strength in foreign
markets  one firm reported that their booming aircraft business required such long hours
and continued stress on skilled workers to figure out ways to meet demand that employee
turnover had tripled  not surprisingly yearoveryear manufactured exports for the
region rose in the first quarter
elsewhere news in the region has been fairly positive with business confidence
rising and commercial real estate markets good and improving throughout  residential
real estate markets remain slow  regardless of what measure is used the regions home
prices appear to have slowed more than the nations  however although we had led the
nationthis is not something in which you want to lead the nationin the rate of rising
foreclosure initiations especially for those related to subprime mortgages the pace of this
growth has subsided  indeed initiations of subprime foreclosures went down in the
region most recently  moreover in the most recent data on home sales the northeast
was a bright spot  i have speculated before that the new england residential real estate
market could be bottoming out  such thoughts may remain in the category more of a
hope than a certainty but perhaps the pace of decline is slowing  finally while
consumer confidence has been bouncy recently probably from concerns about gasoline
prices demand seems reasonably strong as gauged by local retailers  software and it
firms are showing considerable strength and at least in our region so is temporary help
coincident indicators of regional health also show solid growth for all six states  in sum
the region appears to be doing fairly well and except for residential real estate there are
perhaps growing signs of price and resource pressures in that regard not unlike the nation
as a whole
turning to the nation i was pleased to see that incoming data validated the
substantial pickup in secondquarter growth that we along with the greenbook had
forecasted  indeed outside of residential investment incoming data have depicted an
economy that is growing at a relatively healthy pace  data on shipments and orders of
capital goods have improved consumer demand seems relatively well maintained despite
high gas and soft home prices and payroll data show little sign of dwindling labor
demand  markets have at last decided to adopt the committees more positive outlook on
economic prospects and credit was repriced as a result  i view this event as healthy  it
has tempered our gdp forecast slightly but the continued ebullience of equity markets is
an important offset  as i noted at our last meeting we find ourselves a bit more
optimistic than the greenbook about trends in residential real estate based on new
housing starts and data on new home sales most recently and we have moderated the
pace of decline of residential investment for the second quarter just a bit relative to our
may forecast  the april value of nonresidential construction put in place was a clear
positive as well  the health of the rest of the world continues to surprise and we like the
greenbook expect little drag from net exports over the forecast period
turning to projections for 2008 and 2009 the factors shaping our outlook havent
changed much  we continue to see output accelerating mildly as the housing situation
moderates and more of the underlying strength of the economy shows through  this is
tempered a bit both by rising longterm interest rates and by our expectations that
consumers will mend their ways a bitconsume less and save more  this hasnt shown
signs of happening yet  by the end of 2009 gdp is about at potential unemployment
has ticked up a bit but remains below 5 percent and core inflation moves down gradually
to 2 percentagain not much change and certainly within the central tendency of
members forecasts  one obvious risk to this forecast lies in housing as everybody has
said  but as i noted at our last meeting the longer there are no obvious spinoffs from the
subprime problem to the wider economy the more that particular risk seems to ebb
indeed as we have yet to see the saving rate pick up with the moderation in consumption
over what would be expected by the fundamentals there may be some upside to growth
pressures from abroadworldwide expansion of somewhat larger size than we
expecteddo raise some upside issues both for growth and for inflation
on the inflation side it is true that the april and may core data were encouraging
however those numbers were dominated by temporary rather than permanent effects at
least in our view  so we havent moderated our forecast of core inflation as have the
greenbook authors albeit they moderated it only in a very minor way and i remain
concerned about upside risks  headline cpi inflation has been strong  the
unemployment rate and widening concerns about input costs suggest that pressures to
raise prices might have grown and strong growth worldwide affects not only input prices
but the value of the dollar as well  if anything since our last meeting i think that risks
related to growth have abated and have become more balanced and risks regarding
inflation have grown  thus as we look over the next two and a half years our forecast
sees policy staying somewhat restrictive given the inflation risks and then easing a bit in
late 2008 or 2009 to a level closer to its equilibrium rate
finally continuing some thoughts i began to articulate at our last meeting as we
think about policy we also need to be concerned about financial stability  this is
particularly true given what weve seen in the markets for credit derivatives  weve
talked before about how high levels of liquidity and low interest rates worldwide cause
much reaching for risk much reaching for return and related risktaking  while the bear
stearns hedge fund issue may well not have legs the concerns regarding valuation of the
underlying instruments do give one pause  can markets adequately arrive at prices for
some of the more exotic cdo tranches  what happens when the bottom falls out and
positions thought to be at least somewhat liquid become illiquid  is there a potential for
this to spread and become a systemic problem  maybe not and i am not advocating our
taking any action as a central bank  but i do think the size of the credit derivatives
market its lack of transparency and its activities related to subprime debt could be a
gathering cloud in the background of policy  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you  i will spend just a couple of minutes extra on the
district this time because generally speaking our district economy continues to perform
very well despite the weakness in the housing sector  energy and agriculture remain very
strong and manufacturing remains generally strong although we have seen some
levelingoff of that in the past month  the strength in these three sectors has helped spur
broadbased job growth throughout the district and a significant tightening of our labor
markets and their conditions  many of our contacts report labor shortages and higher
wage pressures  demand for skilled labor remains very strong and some firms have
limited hiring plans because of the unavailability of qualified workers  to bolster
recruiting a few companies have partnered with vocational schools to offer industry
specific training programs to try to fill the gap  since our last meeting hiring
announcements which we try to track have outpaced layoff announcements by a margin
of 6 to 1  one anecdotal piece of informationwe have some fairly large engineering
firms in kansas city that build power plants globally including in china and also
ethanol plants  last year one ceo told me that they hired 2100 engineers and were
unable to fill 900 positions on a global basis  so there is a lot of activity going on out
there
construction activity remains mixed with weakness in residential construction
balanced by strength in commercial construction  on the residential side we have seen
some pickup in sales but high inventories have limited new construction  for us
problems with subprime loans are concentrated in colorado and in a few other areas  but
because of the strength in energy and agriculture some parts of the region are actually
experiencing a housing boom with strong homeprice appreciation  relative to the total
market that is small but it is a rather sharp contrast  conditions in agriculture are the
best in recent years  spring rains have alleviated drought conditions in much of our
region  strong demand and limited supplies continue to boost farm commodity prices
and farm incomes  however we are also beginning to see the effects of higher livestock
and crop prices on retail food prices themselves  an additional concern is the sharp rise
in land prices throughout much of our district  firstquarter cropland values in the
district rose roughly 12 percent above yearago levels and ranchland values have
strengthened as well that much or perhaps a little more  our contacts in the real estate
industry indicate that some of the recent surge in land prices is speculative in nature and
some district bankers have expressed concern about the bubble in farmland values driven
in part by the ethanol boom that we have heard about  in recent examination reports our
supervision staff have begun to see some increases in nonperforming real estate loans
and that includes some pickup in other real estate owned as well  these developments
are very preliminary but they are reminiscent of an earlier time and we are trying to pay
a little more attention to that
on the national outlook data released since the last meeting support the view that
growth will pick up over the year  i have been encouraged by the recent pickup in retail
sales and by positive news on employment and personal income  at the same time the
recent increase in longerterm interest rates if sustained is likely to damp growth
somewhat in the period ahead  in particular the rise in the thirtyyear fixed mortgage
rate may deepen and prolong the ongoing housing slump  the combined effects of
weaker growth in the first quarter and the rise of longterm rates have led me to lower my
estimate of growth in 2007 to about 23 percent  i expect growth of 27 in 08 and 28 in
09  i now think the risks perhaps are roughly balanced  while the downside risk from
housing remains the outlook for other sectors as others have reported has appeared to
improve  markets seem to have adopted this view as well as removal of the expected
policy easing has contributed to the flattening of the yield curve at this point
in terms of the inflation outlook recent data have been favorable with core cpi
on a twelvemonth basis down to 2 percent  i expect continued moderation over the
year  in particular if owners equivalent rent continues at the slower pace of the past
three months it will help bring down the twelvemonth core inflation number over time
despite these recent improvements i continue to believe that upside risks to inflation
remain  the possible passthrough of recent energy and food price inflation to core
inflation may slow progress toward lower inflation  in addition pressures from resource
utilization and slow productivity growth if that happens to be the case could affect that
outlook as well  finally i am somewhat concerned with the recent uptick in longerterm
inflation expectations  we have talked about the tips fiveyear fiveyearahead
breakeven inflation rate as mentioned in the earlier briefing it has increased about 20
basis points over the past month  so in light of these factors i believe it is important that
we continue to signal to the markets that current inflation rates are not acceptable over
the longer term  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  it is about 420  why dont we take a
twentyminute coffee break and then resume
coffee break
chairman bernanke  if we could resume  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  news from the fourth district is
little changed from my last report  the district economy continues to be weighed down
by weakness in the housing market and there is general consensus among my contacts
that the housing sector has not yet seen bottom  to date adverse spillovers from housing
to other sectors of the economy have not been observed although this remains a
significant risk to the outlook
while i have heard some reports from my business contacts that the labor market
is strengthening the official data still do not show net employment growth in the region
my projections for the national economy still call for growth to resume to a more typical
expansionary pace as we move beyond 2007  my projection for gdp is slightly stronger
than what is seen in the latest greenbook because of my assumption for slightly stronger
growth in potential  obviously i dont make that judgment with great confidence
however the business leaders i talk with tell me that their plans to expand capital are
consistent with a pickup in productivity growth from its recent cyclical low  this
includes the cleveland cavalierslaughtera franchise which as many of you know
experienced a substantial productivity shortfall against the san antonio spurs a couple of
weeks ago  laughter  here too we are projecting a good rebound so to speak in
2008  in the meantime i would like the record to show that i am making good on my
wager with president fisher  i brought with me a selection of clevelands finest and i
will present those to richard after this meeting with my heartfelt congratulations  i am
putting this back because it feels funny having a beer bottle in my hand  laughter
mr fisher  if this were the australian reserve bank it would be okay
laughter
ms pianalto  i also extend my heartfelt congratulations to the spurs on their
fourth and final nba championship  laughter  now turning to inflation i am hearing
reports of upward price pressures across a handful of industrial commodities and notably
for metals  but wage pressures remain modest  nevertheless for the first time in more
than a year i am hearing from my business contacts that they are concerned about
inflation  they are bringing inflation concerns up with me and they are telling me that
they concur with the committees assessment that inflation remains a risk  to be sure
there were many positive signs in the may cpi report  the traditional core cpi beat
expectations and while the trimmed mean estimators that we produce in cleveland were
a little higher than the measure excluding food and energy even those indicators were
consistent with the moderation and the longerterm inflation trend we expect to see
looking at the core measures enables me to be encouraged by the may cpi report  but
that view is a rather hard sell to a public that saw headline cpi inflation rise 8 percent
at an annualized rate last month  indeed our readings of the underlying inflation trend
and what people are feeling in their wallets have been at odds for many years now
i understand that our policies are not well advised or even equipped to address
transitory price movements  but at some point large and persistent price disturbances
such as we have seen in energy markets warrant our attention  if these isolated price
pressures become more generalized and enter into consumer and business
decisionmaking we could easily find ourselves living in the greenbooks drifting
inflation expectations scenario
in summary i think the housing market still presents a risk that the economy may
not resume a more typical growth trajectory over the forecast period  nonetheless that
concern is trumped by the risk that we may yet lose the publics confidence that we are
making sustainable progress against inflation  therefore i continue to believe that the
predominant risk going forward is that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  let me talk first about some of the
anecdotal reports  a contact with a large software company suggested that the it
industry is doing fine  labor is very tight because technical people are in such scarce
supply  this company is expanding development facilities in china and india  they are
not allowed to import the labor they need and so they will send the operations abroad
my contacts with transportation industry people get the same information that richard
fisher is emphasizing  movement of goods is just really really flat  the overtheroad
trucking industry is actually taking down capacity selling off the older less efficient
trucks  in the express business ups is taking down capacity  fedex is more optimistic
probably taking market share  a contact with the fast food industry says that their
business volume is down  the whole industry is down  sales revenues are up a bit but it
is because of price increases  the casual dining industry is down even more
there is sort of a disconnect here between the overall view of the economy i
think and the anecdotal reports that come from the movement of goods  of course the
most cyclical part of the economy is always the goods part  the services part is much
more stable  perhaps what is going on here is simply what is also in the greenbooks
secondquarter numbers because the goods part of the economyconsumptionis
pretty flat  i think consumption is onlyi forget the exact number16 or something
that is an annual rate  you have to divide that by 4 to tell you what is actually going on
in the quarter itself  of course the housing industry continues to decline  so maybe
these anecdotal reports really are consistent with what is going on and what is in the
greenbook picture  the greenbook picture makes a lot of sense to me
let me talk a little more about housing  the staff presentation had a point that i
want to underscorethat the housing downturn is unlike any other that we have had  i
think the chart went back to 1972 but you could go back before that  if you look at the
housing downturns and the recessions of the 1950s they were all related to a very
standard cyclical pattern  interest rates would rise housingstarts permits
constructionwould start to turn down well before the cycle peak and then housing
would start to recover after the cycle peak as interest rates came down  the current
situation is completely different from that standard pattern  here we had a housing boom
driven by a period of very low interest rates  the period really got started when we were
holding the fed funds rate at 1 percent  then you had a lot of these financial innovations
and subprime mortgages that added a sector to the market that hadnt traditionally been
there  interest rates came up housing prices are flattening out and my concern is that
there is a lot more to go  this is an asset market that does not work anything like
securities markets  it is completely different from the stock market and the bond market
housing starts and permits peaked in the early part of last year and the adjustment really
got under way  but if you think about how much of the adjustment is completewell
there is not much sign that much is complete because the inventory of unsold new houses
is close to its peak  there is no convincing evidence that it is really starting to come
down  we have seen some bankruptcies of builders but not very many  a lot of
banksi know from our contactsare putting pressure on their builders to sell out their
houses and pay off the loans  the same thing is true of the ground as the real estate
people like to put it  builders are stopping their development of new land for housing
developments because they dont have the financing to support it anymore  the banks
are starting to turn off the credit spigot because these companies are getting pretty close
to the edge  they have laid off a large number of workers but they have to sell out their
inventory  still the number of months supply that they are sitting on is abnormally
high it really hasnt come down  we also know that prices in this market respond with a
very substantial lag to the underlying determinants of prices  so prices of existing homes
are only gradually adjusting and i think there is probably more of that to go
we know that there will be a lot more resets of these adjustablerate mortgages
the projections are that a lot more defaults than we have yet seen will occur in that area
so i think that we have a long adjustment to go here  whether that will spread into the
rest of the economy i dont know  i share the greenbook estimate that probably there
wont be major fallout but it seems to me that the risk there is significant  i just wanted
to underscore that point because i think this risk is by far the biggest that we face at this
time  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i would like to speak earlier next
time so i dont have to give credit to so many of the previous speakerslaughter
including president poole who really said a lot of what i have to say  there wasnt much
change in the sixth district economic picture during the intermeeting period particularly
regarding things that are relevant to the national outlook  so i am not going to devote a
lot of time to discussing acrosstheboard conditions in the district  my staffs outlook
and my outlookfor the national economy doesnt differ much from the greenbook
analysis and forecast so i also wont detail small differences between those two
forecasts  the greenbook outlook reflects the baseline expectation of a diminishing drag
on real growth from residential investment  since our forecast largely agrees with the
greenbook we obviously see the most likely playout of the housing correction similarly
however as suggested in the greenbooks first alternative simulation we may be too
sanguine  i think this is really president pooles message about a recovery in the housing
sector  that is to say the downturn in residential investment will be deeper and more
prolonged and possibly involve spillovers  so i would like to devote my comments in a
cautionary tone to this particular concern
credit available for residential real estate purchases is contracting and the credit
contraction specifically in the subprime mortgage market has the potential to lengthen
the transition period required to reduce housing inventories to normal levels  this
tightening of credit availability along with higher rates may affect the timeline of the
recovery  one market of concern is the starter home market  the subprime mortgage
market has been a major credit source for firsttime homebuyersalthough as has been
mentioned earlier subprime mortgages are a small portion of the aggregate stock of
mortgages  subprimes were 20 percent of originations in 2005 and 2006 and if you
added alta nonprime mortgages you would get 33 percent of originations in the past
two years  in many suburban areas like those around atlanta and nashville in my
district much home construction was targeted at firsttime buyers  we have heard
anecdotal reports from banking and real estate contacts in our region that tighter credit
conditions have aggravated the already sluggish demand for homes  the countrys
largest homebuilderthere may be a debate with president fisherlaughter so one of
the countrys largest homebuilders headquartered in miami reported on tuesday a 29
percent drop in homes delivered and a 75 percent drop in average prices  but that is
combined with a 77 percent increase in sales incentives  they attribute their negative
sales experience to rising defaults among subprime borrowers and higher rates  that
companys ceo said that he sees no sign of a recovery and he provided guidance of a
loss position in the third quarter
because of the major role that homebuildingand i might add construction
materials particularly in forest productsplays in the sixth district economy and
because of some tentative signs of spillover we will continue to monitor these
developments in our district very carefully  as i stated at the outset we share the basic
outlook described in the greenbook but observation of the housing sector dynamics in
the sixth district has raised our level of concern that the national housing correction
process may cause greaterthanforecasted weakness in real activity  if that is the case
and inflation gains prove transitory as suggested in the greenbook commentary we may
be dealing with a far more challenging policy tradeoff than we are today  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  since our last meeting the news in the
third district economy has been mixed but on balance slightly more positive than the
previous report  the district continues to grow at a moderate pace and we expect that pace
to continue  the bright spot since our last meeting is a rebound in regional manufacturing
activity which had been flat for the past six months  in june the philadelphia business
outlook survey index of current activity rose sharply18 percentage pointsfrom a level
of 42  this is the highest level it has obtained since april 2005  the index of new orders
also showed a sizable jump and capital spending plans firmed in the survey  respondents
also expected further improvement in manufacturing activity over the coming months
job growth in the region however was somewhat slower over the past two months
compared with earlier in the year but we really didnt expect much since payrolls seemed to
rise much more rapidly than expected during the first quarter  yeartodate payroll growth
is running about 06 percent at an annual rate  that rate is slower than the national average
but is fairly typical of our region where population growth is rather flat  labor force
participation is rather flat as well  unemployment rates however remain low in our three
states and firms still report having difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled workers
it is no surprise as everyone has said that residential construction in our region
continues to decline and remains weak  the value of contracts for residential buildings has
fallen more than 30 percent in the region during the first five months of this year compared
with last year at this timebut that we have to remember was near the peak  real estate
agents and homebuilders generally report slowing of sales in may  while the number of
existing homes for sale on the market has increased average selling prices have not changed
much  i would characterize the nonresidential real estate market in the region as fairly firm
although construction is not as strong as last year  office vacancy rates continue to fall and
in center city philadelphia they dropped to 10 percent  they were about 17 percent just
around eighteen months ago  real estate firms report that overall demand for industrial
space continues to be robust and that vacancy rates for this type of space are near record
lows in some markets  rental rates continue to rise particularly for warehouse space and
rents are at a record high in those areas  i take these reports as indications of continued
expansion in economic activity going forward
interestingly enough regarding building i had two observations from ceos  one is
ceo of a building supply company that manufactures throughout the united states and has
sales of almost 10 billion  he said that remarkably even with what is going on with
homebuilding his sales are holding up very very strongly and they are doing very very
well this year  another ceo whose company produces products mostly for residential
cabinetry and other types of things one of the largest in the country says that while new
home sales for his work are way down they have largely been offset by remodeling
activitypeople have substituted remodeling for buying a new home
as long as im reporting anecdotes here i will pass on one other anecdote for what
it is worth about trucking  i listened to president fisher and president poole talk about
volumes in trucking  just as an observation an executive who runs a trucking company
throughout the country told me that one thing that has happened in trucking is that rather
than shipping boom boxes they are shipping ipods  laughter  that is true of a lot of
consumer goods  instead of shipping large crt screens they now ship flat panel displays
so even while the volume of goods is being reduced gasoline prices are high and they are
laying off truckers and downsizing the volume the value of what they are shipping has been
maintained pretty well  so he was noting a dynamic of value versus volume here which i
thought was very interesting
on the inflation front in the district prices for industrial goods continue to increase
but retail price increases have not been widespread  however many of our business
contacts continue to express concern over rising energy costs and food prices and the effect
on their businesses and the consumers  i interpret this to mean that they continue to be
puzzled by our focus on core inflation when they see that overall inflation is what affects the
consumer and their businesses and they seem to doubt core inflations value as a policy
objective or a measure of underlying inflation  they may be wrong in that but it tells me
that if they continue to be confused by how we view core inflation and what we use it for
we might need to improve our communication to the public about how we think about it and
why we focus on it
on the national level i have become more comfortable with the economic situation
as the year has progressed  at our meeting in may we were beginning to see some positive
signs regarding both real economic activity and inflation  durable good orders were up
allaying some concerns about the first quarters weakness in business investment  improved
ism numbers were signaling that the slowdown in manufacturing might be ending and
although housing markets remained weak there were limited signs of any significant
spillovers to other sectors  labor markets remained firm  at that time there were signs that
core inflation might be moderating  as a consequence i expressed hope that in the coming
months those data would be reinforced
fortunately from my perspective those hopes have been largely realized  coming
into this meeting we have received more positive news on the economy and i have become
somewhat more confident that the economy is on track to return to neartrend growth later
this year as the effect of the housing correction moderates albeit very slowly  indeed data
received to date suggest that we will see a substantial rebound in real gdp growth this
quarter as the greenbook has noted  after several months of stagnation manufacturing
activity seems to have picked up and business fixed investment is moderately strengthened
labor markets remain firm and yet in recent quarters we have noted a seeming disconnect
between strong labor markets and weaker gdp growth  however we now may be getting
some hints that this puzzle is more apparent than real and i want to reinforce the point that
president yellen made earlier in that i think two factors suggest this  first from december
to may the household survey showed almost no employment growth whatsoever whereas
the establishment survey showed 12 percent annual growth during that period  second
and again as president yellen notedthe business employment dynamics report came out
it was only for the third quarter of last year but it showed about 155000 fewer jobs created
in the third quarter than we thought  what is important about that report is that it arguably
does a better job of tracking the birth and death of firms in the data and so there is some
reason to believe that while this is suggestive the payroll employment that we have been
seeing may not be as strong as perhaps we thought and that may make some of this puzzle
less of a concern  moreover as president yellen pointed out it is also relevant for the
longer term because if employment wasnt as strong as we thought productivity is going to
end up being higher than we thought and it will help resolve some of that slowdown in
productivity  so i think there are various hints that that may be the direction that we are
headed
in my own forecast i see slightly more underlying strength and so a somewhat faster
return to trend growth than the greenbook does  the current stance of monetary policy is
maintained  i see strength in personal income a strong balance sheet as we saw earlier
today strong equity markets and a resiliency already shown by consumers despite the
lower home equity values and higher gasoline prices suggesting that there is probably
slightly more momentum in consumer spending than suggested in the greenbook  i am
modestly more optimistic about the labor market than the greenbookmodestly as i
anticipate less of a downturn in labor force participation rates than is built into that forecast
the rise in longterm interest rates reflects the markets upgrading of its assessment of the
economys strength going forward  indeed as has been noted a couple of times that uptick
in longterm interest rates has been i wont say a worldwide phenomenon but certainly
widely spread in many countries around the world which may be saying that global growth
is more stable predictable and positive than perhaps we thought
now this is not to say that i do not see risks around this growth forecast  of course
as everyone else does i see housing as the biggest downside risk that we face  there is still
considerable uncertainty out there and i do not want to underestimate the risk  housing
inventories remain high and i do not see any strong evidence of pickup in demand  despite
the problems in subprime lending markets however i think the financial sector remains
healthyhealthier now than it was perhaps in the early 90s with the previous housing
boom  i am more comfortable with the notion that there will be no spillovers into other
parts of the economy and thus i have become more comfortable with forecasts of returnto
trend growth in the second half of this year and into 08
on the inflation front higher energy prices have led to an acceleration of headline
inflation but there has been some improvement in core inflation measures in recent months
the threemonth growth rates in the core cpi and the core pce have been decelerating
since february  although these developments in inflation are encouraging i remain
cautious about extrapolating too much from recent data  during this cycle we have seen
periods of deceleration reversed a couple of months later  indeed the greenbook expects
that much of the favorable readings on core pce inflation will prove transitory  so i remain
concerned that our core inflation rates may not continue their recent drift down  i would
also caution that headline inflation as i noted earlier has remained stubbornly high  thus
in approaching my forecast i have assumed that the appropriate policy path was one that
would return the economy to steadystate growth and to my inflation target by the end of the
forecast period
given my outlook on the underlying strength of the economy and an inflation goal
of 15 percent for the pce it should not be surprising that my forecast incorporates a
slightly tighter policy path than the greenbook does  in particular in my forecast the federal
funds rate rises 50 basis points to 575 percent by early 08  as progress is made on
bringing down inflation starting in the second half of 08 the fed funds rate moves down
ending at about 5 percent by the end of 2009  this policy path reflects my view that unless
we take further action by additional firming or an announcement or both that commits us to
an inflation goal that is lower than the market currently expects which seems to be about
25 percent i believe it will be difficult to sustain an inflation rate that is in keeping with my
view of price stability  i believe this can be accomplished with relatively little effect on real
growth in 2008  my assumption in the model with which im working is that once we
begin to raise rates the markets will quickly recognize our commitment to lower inflation
and expectations will move down accordingly mitigating the real output effects of this
modest tightening  the movement down in expectations could be expedited by the
committees explicitly announcing the target  this view of expectations formation is more
heavily weighted to forwardlooking elements than to distributedlag elements of past
inflation  by the way i want to applaud the staff for their work on inflation dynamics  i
thought it was an excellent piece of work  i found the discussion very helpful and a step in
the right direction both conceptually and empirically
in any event the bottom line for my forecast is that i anticipate that the economy
will grow just below trend of 3 percent in 2008 and at trend of 3 percent in 2009 and we
achieve an inflation goal of 15 percent by the end of the period  of course this forecast is
based on my desired inflation objective which may not be representative of other members
of the committee  if there were a common objective that differed from my own view then
my presumed appropriate policy path might be different  given this observation and the
lack of an agreedupon goal i think we need to be concerned about how the public will
interpret these forecasts but i will save my thoughts on that for the next goround
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  the outlook looks a
little better i think  the united states looks okay and the world looks very strong
housing here seems as though it will get worse before it gets better but the rest of the
economy seems to be doing reasonably wellwith output and investment spending perhaps
a bit firmer than we thought they would be and employment growth and income growth
looking reasonably good
we have not significantly changed our central projection  we still see an economy
growing around 3 percent over the forecast period about our estimate of potential with core
pce inflation falling just below 2  this assumes a path for the nominal fed funds rate that is
flat for several more quarters essentially the same as in the greenbook and in the market
now  the risks to this outlook though have changed  we see less downside risk to growth
but still believe the risks to our growth forecast are weighted toward the weaker outcomes
although the recent inflation numbers have been good they probably exaggerate the
moderation of underlying inflation and we see therefore continued upside risk to our
inflation forecast  i still think this latter risk should remain our more consequential concern
relative to the greenbook we have a bit more growth because of our higher estimate of
growth in the labor force and a bit less inflation but these differences are small smaller than
they have been and they do not have significant implications for our views on monetary
policy  the markets perceptions of fundamentals have in some respects moved in our
direction in the past few weeks  i say in some respects because we need to be attentive to
the rise in implied inflation that you see in tips  our view and the markets view of the
expansion the risk to the outlook and implications for monetary policy have converged
this means that the effective stance of monetary policy is a little tighter than it was
a few important issues going forward  on the growth front i still think that the
probability of weakness exceeds that of strength  there is still a significant risk that we will
see a more substantial adjustment of house prices perhaps drawn out over a sustained period
of time with greater adverse effects on confidence and spending  of course if employment
and income growth stay reasonably strong the effects of that potential scenario should be
manageable  if not we will have more to worry about  i note that some major financial
institutions are now starting to report signs of rising delinquencies in consumer credit
products outside mortgages such as automobile loans and leases  this is the first time that i
have heard that report in a significant sense and maybe it is a sign of some vulnerability
ahead  the strength of demand growth outside the united states has been helpful and we
agree with the greenbook that it looks likely to continue for some time  but things could be
kind of bumpy out there particularly in places like china and monetary policy in much of
the world is only now starting to move shortterm real rates higher into positive territory
on the inflation front it seems early to declare satisfaction or victory not
particularly because of the recent reacceleration in headline inflation but just because of the
role of transitory factors in the recent moderation in core and the rise in breakevens in tips
we cannot be fully confident yet that a constant nominal fed funds rate at current levels will
deliver an acceptable inflation forecast  we do not in my view need to try to induce right
now a further tightening of financial conditions to push core inflation down further and
faster  but we need more time before we can justify shifting to a more balanced risk
assessment of inflation or something equivalent something that would have the effect for
example of indicating satisfaction with current levels or of suggesting that the risks are
balanced around the path of inflation that we see in our central tendency projections
with financial markets we are at a delicate moment  the losses in subprime are still
working their way through the system  rating agencies are likely to downgrade a larger
share of past issues more than they have already  the marks that people show indicate that
both hedge funds and dealers in a lot of this stuff may still have a way to go to catch up with
the movement in market prices  this dynamic itself could induce a further reduction in
willingness to finance new mortgages  you could see pockets of losses in the system
liquidity pressures in hedge funds and their counterparties and further forced liquidations
it is possible that we will still have a bunch of that effect ahead of us even if no big negative
shock to demand occurs and induces a broader distress in consumer credit  we could also
see it spread to commercial real estate  we could see a broader pullback from cdos and
clos as well either from a general erosion of faith in the rating modelsas bill said it is a
possibilityor from just concerns about liquidity in those instruments  we could see a
sharp substantial widening of credit spreads provoked by an unanticipated default or two or
just a general reassessment of risk at current prices  a very large amount of lbo financing
that is yet to be closed distributed and placed is still working its way through the system
as in the past we could see a deal or two get hung the music stop and that force some
broader repricing  people get stuck with stuff they dont want to hold or did not expect to
hold  i think we now see more sensitivity in markets about the prospect of a diminished
appetite among the worlds savers and central banks to increase their exposure to the united
states or at least we see more sensitivity to the perception out there that the dynamic might
be unfolding  you can see a bit of all this in some spreads in some reports of resistance to
further erosion in covenants in some reduced appetite for new bridge book exposure to
leveraged lending  you can see it in some changes in margin terms in some instruments vis
vis some counterparties  for now i think it is a relatively healthy still pretty modest and
quite contained shift toward a more cautious assessment of risk but these things generally
dont tend to unfold gradually  on balance though i think we are in a pretty good place in
terms of policy in terms of the markets expectations about policy now and in terms of how
we have been framing the balance of risks to the outlook
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  my projection was closely in line with
that of the greenbook modestly belowtrend growth for a few quarters held down by a
prolonged weakness in housing  as that drag abates the economy picks up to potential and
is held back from overshooting that potential by various factors including the rise in the
saving rate and slightly lower growth of government spending
under these circumstances core pce inflation holds in the neighborhood of
2 percent  i do not really see much to push it one way or another at this point  the
economy is producing very near its potential as close as we can figure  inflation
expectations have been moving in a narrow range  some of the transitory factors such as
owners equivalent rent that were expecting to come down to reduce inflation have already
done that to a considerable extent  so i dont see them moving forward as having a big
effect  given the limited passthrough of energy and commodity prices into core prices i
would not expect much downward pressure on inflation from a levelingout of those prices
i think that we are around 2 percent and that we will probably stay there at least for a little
while
in terms of risks the recent data on capital goods orders and shipments and
manufacturing activity suggest as many have remarked some reduced downside risk from
business attitudes on spending  they do not suggest a great deal of strength in business
capital spending however  the fundamentals are less favorable than they were a couple of
years ago and the most recent data which we received today suggest a pretty flat or a
modest upward tilt to capital spending in the second quarter  the data werent that strong
but they do suggest that what i feared in maythat we were in the midst of a cyclical
adjustment that was going to make capital spending much weakerhas certainly abated
i agree with many others around the table that housing is a significant downside risk
to the forecast given the high level of inventories despite a major reduction in starts over the
past year and the pricetorent ratio being as high as it is  the further slide in housing may
be gentle as president lacker said but i do not think weve seen the bottom yet  you can
go a long way at a gentle slope  laughter  we also have not yet really seen the full effects
of the tightening in subprime credit terms or obviously of the recent increase in mortgage
rates
i also see a big downside risk from consumption  the greenbook has the growth of
consumption sustained despite an increase in saving rates as the growth in disposable
income exceeds the growth in gdpand that is with the labor share recovering and the
business profit share declining  i see two downside risks to that  one is that the saving rate
will rise faster as the housing weakness feeds through both in terms of wealth effects and in
terms of reduced availability of credit as terms tighten and there is less equity to borrow
against particularly for liquidityconstrained households  i also continue to see a downside
risk to equity prices although i have certainly been wrong so far  nellies table presenting
the difference between the staffs forecast of profits and the markets forecast of profits
showed a huge difference for next year  so though i think the basic outlook is fine i still
see some downside risk on that side
on the inflation front i like others see the betterthanexpected core inflation as a
hopeful sign but it is recent and may be affected by temporary factors and i do not think we
need to get too enthusiastic about it  i do see several upside risks to inflation  the high level
of total headline inflation which could erode inflation expectations business resistance to
any erosion of profit margins as unit labor costs pick up the high levels of resource
utilization in the united states and the tighter global conditions of demand on potential
supply that others of you have mentioned
let me say a word or two about my yearthree projections  i projected output
growth at 2 percent the unemployment rate at 4 percent and core pce inflation at
19 percent  i certainly saw my output and employment projections as a sense of what the
steady state was  on the unemployment rate i do think the odds are better that the nairu
is lower than that it is higher than the staffs 5 percent assumption  this judgment is partly
based on the very moderate pickup in the employment cost index and average hourly
earnings growth has actually been coming off recently  on the behavior of core inflation i
dont see much evidence that we are significantly beyond potential now although i
recognize that with a very flat phillips curve it could be a long time before one figures that
out  but i had growth of potential at 2 percent which is below what i infer to be the
central tendency of the committee
regarding my reading of the decline in productivity growth productivity over the
past five quarters has been growing significantly below the staffs estimate of 2 percent
some of it is cyclical  there could be a revision as presidents plosser and yellen have
suggested  i confess to having asked david wilcox about this at the break and he said that
the data are kind of ambiguous here and that it is much too early to predict a significant
downward revision to employment  but i hope you are right  now some of the recent
slowdown certainly must be cyclical though i would have thought that labor hoarding and
things like that would be much less in todays flexible labor markets with so much more use
of temporary workers than there has been in the past  i would think that the cyclical effects
on productivity would be muted that businesses would move pretty promptly to adjust their
labor forces to output  so i wonder how much cyclicality there is  the big uncertainty is in
the construction industry and in the fact that construction employment hasnt come down
we dont quite understand why it hasnt come down more  so perhaps productivity will
pick up
but i still would look at the staffs 2 percent as having even just a little more
downside than upside risk to it given the fact that we have had more like 1 to 1 percent in
the past four or five quarters  so i stuck with the staffs forecast of 2 percent potential
gdp
in some sense our view of what the potential growth rate is isnt all that important
for monetary policy  we ought to be looking at the gap  we ought to be looking at the
pressure of the level of production on the level of potential gdp  but i dont think its quite
that easy  we dont know what that gap is  we have seen that the surprises over the past
year or two have been in the behavior of the unemployment rate and capacity utilization
relative to growth  so we do tend to look at our estimates of potential growth and the
actuals coming in relative to those estimates and pass judgment on whats happening to the
output gap even when the unemployment rate doesnt move  we just need to remember that
potential growth is an entirely estimated number that we will never observe and we need to
be aware that it might not be quite as high as the central tendency indicates that my
colleagues on the committee apparently think it is  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  regarding overall economic growth my
own macroeconomic views are not inconsistent with the central tendency of the projections
that were pulled together for this meeting  i think the staff and the participants around the
table deserve significant credit for being stubborn about the moderategrowth hypothesis
while markets have been on all sides of it  the markets appear ready to look through the
secondquarter gdp growth number which appears to be a bit above trend  id say that we
have gotten some credit from the markets for being stubborn and stubbornly right on our
economic forecast but they certainly havent given us their proxy and i would not expect
them to do so  they happen to share our views for now is what i would say and i wouldnt
expect that situation to remain over the forecast period  again neither should our intention
be to somehow get these curves to match over the coming several quarters
on the inflation picture though it has improved a bitand i am trying not to
disregard very good newsi must say that it strikes me as thoroughly unconvincing  to
me inflation in our old statement language remains the predominant risk  i am less certain
that core will continue the recent trend  i do believe that headline inflation may be telling us
something in terms of secular trends around energy and food that we cant dismiss and the
warnings from some of the other signals that we would see as rough proxies for inflation are
still very real
regarding what the financial conditions are telling us about growth it strikes me
that from all the data we have received between our last meeting and this financial
conditions might be as different as any other sets of data that we received  my view is that
financial conditions are still supportive of growth but somewhat less so  it is hard to
determine at this point how much but let me take a stab at doing just that  since we last
met as bill said at the outset we witnessed tenyear treasury yields increase on the order of
between 30 and 50 basis points  i am not uncomfortable with that incremental tightening of
policy in the financial markets but we have to be careful of what we wish for  i think the
explanation from our staff here in washington and bill and the staff in new york is right
which is that markets have not come to a rosier view of the future  all they have really done
is to take out the downside risk that came out of the first quarter  as the data came in a bit
above expectations that insurance bet that they hadthat we were wrong and would have
to cut ratesreally lost credibility  i think their central view of the economy now is not one
that roars back but one that is quite consistent with the moderate growth story  the financial
markets have indeed tightened policy somewhat  even since the time that the bluebook was
produced last week spreads have apparently widened in addition to the riskfree rate being
somewhat higher  but this is all happening in very real time and my report a week ago
would have sounded quite a bit different from the one today
we have witnessed increased term premiums and greater volatility across many if
not all financial markets  both the move index for treasuries and the vix for equities are
high relative to the averages of the past year but are still fairly reasonable over a somewhat
broader periodsay the last five years  term premiums i would characterize as returning
to morenormal levelsbut again not out of line with history
we have seen in the bluebook that credit default swap cds spreads and other
spreads had widened but that yet hadnt happened in the highyield market where
apparently there was some narrowing of spreads  that has changed rather dramatically in
the past four or five trading days  im sure vince will share more information on this
tomorrow  but the cds spreads really occurred first then there was a lag to highyield
spreads  in the past two weeks investmentgrade cds spreads have widened about 7 basis
points highyield cds spreads have widened about 20 a relatively new index of loan cds
spreads has widened about 65 basis points and most if not all structured products even
assets wholly unrelated to the housing markets have been undergoing some spread
widening  as i mentioned highyield spreads appear to be catching up to cds spreads and
with the incredible flow of deals in the market i would guess that the trend continues
were seeing higher financing costs and slightly tougher terms for lbos the latter is a
remarkable new development  ma prices probably for the first time since i have been
sitting at this table appear in the markets to be coming off their levels  so when auctions
for properties of publicly traded companies are occurring the price between initial
indications of interest and final bids for the first time may actually be coming down
why is that  interest coverage ratios cannot go much below where they have been
in this cycle  it is 12 or 13 times but again as the riskfree rate has gone up as spreads
have widened you can buy just a little less debt for that  as a result equity players that do
not want to compromise their equity returns can pay a little less for these properties
whether this phenomenon is very short term like the phenomena we heard about after the
tumult in late february and we returned to in the heady days of the capital markets i do not
know  this may just be a temporary preference shift toward quality and toward higher
volatility and a return to the glory days but i tend to think not  it is a tough call and i
reserve the right to change my judgment
i think that the new supply thats coming into the markets most of which needs to
get priced before the markets slow down in august will test the markets resilience will test
prices and will test terms  up to this point we have seen very little reduction in liquidity
but we are seeing a few deals being pulled from the market  pricing power appears to be
coming back to investors and negotiations around prices and terms seem significantly more
balanced than they have been in a very long time  some of the instruments that we have sort
of giggled about around this tablethe payinkind notes with optional cash payment
seem to have lost some traction in the market in the past week  i do not know whether they
will return but i take this new discipline in the markets as an encouraging sign  so what is
going to be the resulting effect on prices terms and conditions  that is something we will
have to judge but financial conditions as i said at the outset are perhaps somewhat more
restrictive than they were but they should still be quite supportive of growth
at the outset i talked about the risk on the inflation front  let me build on a couple
of remarks that vice chairman geithner made about risks now in the financial markets  if
the problems that we have seen around structured products that have come out of the bear
stearns scenario are really about the subprime markets and subprime collateral and housing
theres not much to worry about  but to the extent that the story is really about structured
productsproducts that have not been significantly stresstestedthen there is a risk that
the financial markets may react and overreact  that scenario will bring up reputational risk
issues  even financial intermediaries that are in the agency business are relearning the
lesson that agency business is not freethat there are in fact dissynergies from being in the
principal investment business and the agency business under one marketing name  we are
learning a lot about what the markets believe about the transparency of prices particularly in
times of financial distress  of course in times of distress the correlations among all these
assets do not look as they do in models and that is something that will play itself out  i
think that tim rightly referenced the role of gatekeepers in the credit agencies who i suspect
are going to have a fairly rude awakening over the next six to nine months  as i also said
regarding this financial innovation which on net is of great benefit to us we will really see
some of the products tested  along with the products moreover the market participants
behavior will be tested perhaps in this upcoming period as never before  so the financial
markets are a friend on this but there is greater risk than there was when we last met  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  the last time we met there seemed to
be a bit of increased uncertainty about a potential downdraft on economic growth and now
some of that concern about that downturn seems to be no longer there  some intermeeting
data have come in a little more on the upside and obviously the markets have changed their
expectations and seem to agree with that  i think the strength in the labor market and in
consumption although facing some challenges is still at a reasonable level  it does seem
that we are getting some signs that investment is coming back
recent durable goods numbers which came out today perhaps raise some questions
of that  we have had a couple of good months and now a bit more of a challenge  but
when you smooth through i think exactly as governor kohn suggested that well have
moderate growth going forward a forecast that i think is consistent with the greenbook
forecast  strength in nonresidential construction as we have heard around the table has also
provided us with a bit more optimism for investment in general  but investment is
obviously closely tied to where productivity is going because if we dont have investment
particularly in the hightech areas rather than just in the construction sectors it is going to be
hard to sustain high productivity growth  when we get the revised numbers on july 27 and
we also get advance gdp were going to get a lot of information about that and i think
there is still a lot of uncertainty as to exactly where productivity is going  so i will defer my
comments until the next meeting because we will have those numbers by then
regarding consumption we have been having the offsetting wealth effects of the
recently robust equity asset market and much less robust housing asset market continuing
strength in the labor market and as the greenbook points out increasing disposable income
because were having incomes grow faster than productivity growth at least right now
that suggests that we might maintain a reasonable support for consumption growth but
again as governor kohn said there are potentially some challenges here
but now i want to discuss the big challenge that everyone keeps talking about
which is the housing market  it has become obvious that the transition is going to be quite a
long one and potentially a painful one perhaps more in individual pockets and for individual
families than for the macroeconomy  it will not just disappear after the third quarter of the
year or even the fourth quarter of the year  i would think in four different ways about how
housing can have a broader effect on the economy
first is obviously the direct effect on prices  the caseshiller tencity index
suggests that the prices will fall about 3 percent over the next year  now thats roughly
where the market was just before the issues in subprime arose at the end of february and it
is actually better than it was last fall  so the markets dont think that there will be an
enormous challenge with respect to prices at least in these ten markets  but as president
poole mentioned sometimes the prices even in these improved indexes like the case
shiller index may lag whats going on and may not accurately reflect the underlying actual
values that people can realize  so there still may be more challenges even though the index
suggests that house prices are down only 3 percent  it is also interesting to look at the delta
the change in the index  we havent really seen much from that which i think is heartening
but it is still something that we have to watch out for
second are the indirect effects the wealth effects  as i mentioned there have been
offsetting wealth effects from the equity markets and the housing market  more broadly
there can be confidence effects on spending and on saving behavior  so far we havent seen
a lot of evidence of that  as vice chairman geithner mentioned there have been anecdotal
reports of challenges in other areas of consumer credit although so far no real systematic
data suggest that  even if there is a little movement up in almost all the typical indexes we
use many of which were mentioned in the briefing we are at lows or are much lower than
usual historically  so even with the small movement up there are not necessarily enormous
challenges but these effects also have to be watched
a third very important potential effect of this long transition is a response by us or
by lawmakers that could make the transition even longer and more difficult  as a number of
you knowand all of you have been facing pressure on some of these thingswe will be
putting out the subprime adjustablerate mortgage guidance that we put out for comment just
at the end of february  our timing couldnt have been better for getting that outwe did it
just as the problems were becoming more of an issue publicly  i hope the guidance will be
out by the end of this week  we are proposing guidance that subprime adjustablerate
mortgages have underwriting at the fully indexed rate  i do not think thats going to be
much of a shock to the markets  the markets have largely moved there already  this was
true from some early statements by freddie mac and fannie mae  also some of the major
players who were not underwriting at the fully indexed rate are simply not there anymore
they are bankruptand some of the other players who were not doing it have changed their
standards  as we know from the survey of senior loan officers standards have been rising
that is not to say that it wont have some effect but relative to where the market has already
moved the effect is not going to be significant
the other major guidance is for giving a prepayment penalty grace period of sixty
days so that people will have at least sixty days before the reset to refinance their mortgage
its unclear from the studies we have done at the board and from looking around how much
of an effect that will have on the initial rate or the socalled teaser rate  it seems that
changing their ability to do that from zero to thirty to sixty days is unlikely to have an
enormous effect on the teaser rate but that is something that is uncertain  there are some
states that already outlaw prepayment penalties or have restrictions on them  there is not a
lot of evidence suggesting that it is more difficult to get financing in those states  again
these guidelines are untested but i dont think they will have an enormous effect on the
market but they are obviously something to watch
as you well know we have put out an interagency letter suggesting that servicers
and lenders work very closely with distressed borrowers to try to work things out and keep
people in their homes  doing so is in the interest of the people in the homes it is virtually
always in the fiduciary interest of the loan servicer and of the lender  i think we have been
making progress on accounting issues that have been making it difficult for some servicers
to do this and we are working very closely with the sec and with fasb on some of these
things  we may be making progress in giving comfort to the servicers who want to do some
restructurings that would help keep people in their houses and would ultimately be better for
the individuals and for the owners of the securities  we have also had the hoepa hearings
here in which we talked about the potential for rule writing in several areas such as
requiring escrow for taxes and insurance some regulation or restriction of prepayment
penalties and various other things  that would be down the line but again we are thinking
that this is unlikely to have a major effect relative to where the markets have already moved
fourth and finally there has been a lot of interest in the effect of subprimes in the
housing market not only on the mortgage market but also more generally on the financial
markets as governor warsh and vice chairman geithner pointed out  fortunately it seems
that liquidity is largely being maintained in the mortgage origination market  there are still
fairly robust amounts of subprime and alta originations occurring  they obviously are
going to be declining over time because there are fewer being made but they were at an
unusually high level in 2006 and so its a natural part of the transition process that they
would go down  there has been a very significant increase in spreads as has been
mentioned by the previous speakers and theres much more tiering of risk  it is not just that
the bs are all the same it is where they originate  the markets are looking through the
packages to see whats in them which is very very valuable  increased volatility and higher
pricing in these markets and the higher longterm interest rate will be a bit more of a
challenge for people doing refinancing although were now down to about 508 for the ten
year off 20 to 25 basis points from the high of the other week and so it may not be quite as
much of a challenge  but there is also a legal risk in this market because if some problems
become larger there could be concern about what the new instrument really means and what
you have actually purchased  if legal risk is there the markets will start to run away from
these things  then you may have some severe liquidity problems  i do not think that we see
those challenges yet but it is one indirect effect on the financial market of some of these
issues
just quickly on inflationmost people have said that weve seen some moderation
it is a little too soon to declare victory  as we said in the initial briefing when we drill
down into the components and look at owners equivalent rent we may get some nasty
surprises going forward  some numbers have gone down but owners equivalent rent may
come back up a bit  so i dont think we can say that the temporary elevation in that area has
passed and that we can move on  i think some challenges are still there  fortunately
expectations still seem reasonably well contained  but i think that there may be some
challenges going forward as the economy continues to grow at least at a moderate pace and
some of the temporary factors are not necessarily completely behind us  we still have to
look for potential price pressures going forward  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you  my view of what has been happening in the economy
is that we have been basically going through a rebalancing  we had a sector that was clearly
bubblelike with excessive spending and now we are getting the retrenchment which is
taking a bit longer than we expected  but the good news is that we are going through a
rebalancing in which we are just moving resources to other sectors and that is actually going
much along the lines that we want to see  the problem in a rebalancing episode is that you
are always worried about the risk that is possible because these transitions dont always
occur smoothly  i think that we were much more worried about thatat least i was more
worriedat the previous meeting  but we have been seeing that the rebalancing is actually
going along pretty well  in particular although the housing market is very weak very much
along the lines of the greenbook forecast it hasnt surprised us this particular period  its
just that it is pretty bad  but the risks are actually fairly balanced on housing because we do
not see it as very strong and that is part of the process of undoing the previous excesses
another very important thing is that we have not seen any surprising spillovers from the
housing market  as time goes on and nothing really bad happens we become more
confident that in fact the downside risk isnt there either  we have also seen that the
investment sector has been looking a little stronger  again that really did concern me at the
last fomc meeting  yet we have had some reasonable numbers they are not spectacular
but i think the downside risks have dissipated
so the bottom line is that i see the economy as rebalancing and doing it in a fairly
good way  in fact from a longrun perspective this is a good thing and not a bad thing
the downside risk has dissipated and the risks are now quite balanced  so i am quite
comfortable with the greenbook forecast on this which is that we have growth somewhat
below trend but moving back toward trend and i see that there has been a shift in a positive
direction and the risks are not excessively on the downside but are much more balanced
when i look at the inflation picture i am in a way pleased with the recent numbers
because there is no strong indication that we are far from potential output and in particular
there is a little indication that the tightness in the economy certainly will be unraveled
according to our forecast not much is going on in that area so whats going on in inflation
expectations will be dominant  i mean given that inflation expectations have been pretty
well anchored around 2 percent although there is some uncertainty i thought that we would
have a return to 2 percent numbers a bit more quickly than the original greenbook forecast
showed  i was really pleased because the greenbook has basically moved closer to the
picture that i had all along so now im very comfortable with the greenbook forecast
in contrast to some other people i think the risks are pretty balanced  now maybe
that is not really different because of the people who have inflation going below 2 percent
and i dont see that  so i believe its going to be 2 now and its going to be 2 for a while
unless we make a concerted effort to change inflation expectations  then there is the whole
issue of how we might go about doing that  but given the current environment my view is
that risks are fairly balanced  other people are saying that there is risk on the upside but i
think thats because they just have slightly lower numbers regarding where they think
inflation will be  but probably when we look at it from that perspective it is about the
same  so right now i think the economy is evolving in a pretty reasonable way and im
sure we will be surprised in one direction or another in the future  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you and thanks to everyone  let me try to give
a quick summary and if i misrepresent you please let me know  participants expectations
for growth were varied but most people expect to see strengthening over the remainder of
this year and into 2008 and 2009  the principal source of downside risk is housing which
remains weak perhaps in part because of problems in mortgage markets  however
significant spillovers have yet to emerge from the housing situation and other components
of demand appear to be strengthening and thereby offsetting the drag from residential
construction  a number of participants referred to the strength of the global economy
which is stimulating us exports but also leading to increases in costs of energy and metals
investment has picked up from a bit of a pothole and is growing now at a moderate pace
with particular strength on the commercial real estate side  inventories are mostly aligned
with sales and manufacturing seems to be strengthening overall  consumption seems likely
to grow at a steady but not exuberant level with factors such as gasoline prices and slower
house appreciation creating some drag but strong employment and incomes acting as
supports  indeed the labor market continues to be strong although there are some
measurement issues that were noted with unfilled demands for highly skilled workers and
with some signs of wage pressures  overall the risks to output seem roughly balanced
around the path of a gradual increase in growth
participants did note the increase in longterm interest rates which tended to align
market policy expectations with those of the committee  higher longterm interest rates
and some other changes in financial markets may be slightly restrictive but probably not
substantially so  some also noted risks in financial markets including the aforementioned
risks associated with the subprime sector but also moregeneral concerns about structured
credit products and the possible effects of a decline in liquidity  however i would note
also as some others did that a bit of cooling in the financial markets might not be an
entirely bad thing
recent core inflation numbers have been favorable and most of you see continued
moderation in inflation resulting from mildly restrictive policy the ending of some
temporary influences and slower increases in shelter costs  however a few of you have
suggested that some of the recent improvement in core inflation is transitory and they noted
upside risks including resource utilization possible passthrough from energy and
commodity costs slower productivity growth and the possible effect of high headline
inflation on inflation expectations  high capacity utilizationand globally president
fisheris also a source of possible inflation pressure
governor kroszner   is president fisher a source of inflation  laughter
mr fisher  only rhetorical inflation
chairman bernanke  all in all there still seems to be general agreement that
the risks to inflation remain to the upside and remain the predominant concern  is that a
reasonable summary  are there any comments
let me present just a few essentially random thoughts at this point  first of all from
my perspective the biggest puzzle about whats happening is the behavior of the labor
market which is continuing  weve had slow growth  unemployment is at least not falling
anymore but it remains stable at a fairly low level  my scenario for the soft landing plus
some moderation of inflation involves some cooling of the labor market from here  i still
think it will happen but admittedly there is only the slightest suggestion so far that it is
happening  in particular we have not yet seen the decline of construction employment
which i have continually referred to and continue to expect  there have been a number of
discussions about why we havent seen that response yet  some have noted the possibility
that a lot of the workers are undocumented and therefore are not being counted by the usual
measures  however they seem to have been counted when the market was expanding  so
it is a little puzzling why suddenly they are not being counted  thus i still think there will
be some moderate softening in the labor market over the next year  if that does not happen
then we will be at some risk of higher upside growth than we anticipate and higher inflation
pressures than we anticipate  so for me that is a central thing to look at  i think in talking
about this it is important to note how uncertain we are about what the natural rate of
unemployment is and that entire concept  judging from the fomcs 2009 projections most
of us think that the natural rate may be a bit below 5 percent and i would note that the
unemployment rate was in the mid to low 4s for four years in the late 1990s and has been in
that range now for about two and onehalf years  so it is not entirely evident where the
natural rate is and it does make some difference obviously  again i expect to see some
moderation in the labor markets and i believe that is critical to our scenario
like everyone else i think the housing situation continues to involve downside
risks  i would reiterate what president poole saidthat this is an asset market that
therefore price changes are inherently at least to some extent unpredictable that a lot is
going to depend on confidence which is going to depend on results which is going to
depend on confidence and therefore that we need to be very careful just the same as with
inflation about declaring victory too soon on the housing front  in particular there is an
interaction between the mortgage market and financial markets  there has been discussion
of that already today but there is the potential for some trigger to lead to what would
amount to an effective tightening in financial markets which would affect not only housing
but also potentially for example corporate credits  although that remains just a risk i think
its one we need to keep in mind
i agree with the general view around the table that except for housing the economy
looks to be healthy  capital spending is not going gangbusters but it does seem to have
come back to some modest trend  i also agree with what a number of people said about the
strength of the world economy  we shouldnt get too carried away with the export sector
what were hoping for here is that net exports will not be a net drag on growth  laughter
nevertheless that is an improvement over the past and the strong world economy should on
net be helpful to our economy
like everyone else im encouraged about the incoming inflation data  i agree that
some of these good numbers may be partially transitory  however when you analyze this
there has been a decided stepdown in the past three or four months in the shelter
component  i would make two observations  one is that excluding shelter core pce
inflation is now at the lowest number since the end of 2003 if the shelter numbers of the
past three months were to persist then that would automatically arithmetically give us some
additional progress on inflation  now that may not happen  clearly we have monthto
month variations as we have mentioned many times but i think some slack could combine
with some more moderation in rents  on the inflation expectations issue i thought david
wilcoxs graphs were very instructive  i do very much believe that inflation expectations
influence actual inflation and that the anchoring of inflation expectations is very important
but i dont think theyre anchored at 2000 i think that theyre anchored at a general range
somewhere around 2 percent  what davids graph showed was that the level of
expectations that we observe seems also to be consistent with 18 or 17  so i dont think
thats an absolute barrier though i concede that expectations play an important role  two i
would also just comment about the statistical issue  i was among a number of people who
talked about the statistical significance of the change in inflation that we have seen and
noted that these monthtomonth changes are subject to a lot of variable shocks  but let me
just say that i think its probably worth noting that in the classical statistical significance
tests and everything were doing here were bayesian decisionmakers and were trying to
make a decision based on our best estimate of where we are at a given moment  even if we
concluded that inflations decline is not statistically significant in a classical sense we still
ought to act as if there has been some decline in inflation  as a thought experiment i would
ask what we would be saying now if we had gone up 06 percentage point from where we
were in may  i think that would have led to a somewhat different tone around the table  so
while acknowledging the statistical variability and the transitory nature i think that there has
been some improvement and that it is showing through into our thinking about the economy
one last thoughta number of people have mentioned the distinction between core
and total inflation  i agree that our communication on this issue really needs some work  i
was just in chicago and several people including directors and employees asked me
dont you guys drive  dont you eat  laughter  clearly we understand why we do
this but i think we need to improve our communication on that particular front  thats a
little segue into what well be talking about tomorrow  so if you will bear with mei know
it is six oclock but id like to ask vincent just to give us a brief introduction to the
monetary policy discussion well be having tomorrow  that will save us some time
tomorrow and give us a chance to think overnight about the subject
mr reinhart4  thank you mr chairman  two personal notes to start  first i am the last person between you and british food which means that im not sure whether it is in your interest for me to speak quickly or slowly laughter  second this week marks the first anniversary of the committees last policy actionthe quarterpoint firming that brought the federal funds rate to 5 percent  paper is the traditional

4  material used by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 4
present and my gift to you is the material labeled fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives
the intermeeting period saw considerable upward revision to investors expectations for the setting of monetary policy  as the shift from the dotted to the solid line shows in the top left panel of the first exhibit the path of the expected federal funds rate rotated up posting increases of 15 basis points at the end of this year and about 50 basis points by the end of next year  the starting point for both the may 8 and the june 26 lines though is the same  market participants continue to believe that you will keep the federal funds rate at 5 percent at this meeting
judging by the desks survey of primary dealers you are also expected to keep the wording of the statement mostly intact
not much of this rise in market yields occurred in narrow windows surrounding the release of economic data and speeches by monetary policy makers  rather the economic data which ran somewhat stronger than anticipated and federal reserve communications with the steady repetition of the assessment that upside risks to inflation remained seemed to induce a rethinking of the economys prospects and the attendant need for monetary policy support  this rethinking is most evident in the middle left panel which shows that the latest primary dealer forecasts of the federal funds rate at yearend the blue bars have shifted notably compared with the survey forecasts just before the may meeting the dashed line
the revision to investors views was associated with the increase of 20 to 50 basis points in the nominal treasury yields plotted in the right panel and seen as the shift from the top dotted black line to the solid black line  the pricingout of near term policy ease probably explains the nowshallow portion at the front part of the yield curve  the rise in nominal yields can mostly be attributed to an increase in real yields of 30 to 50 basis points shown in the lower portion of the same panel  our termstructure models suggest that virtually all the rise in real yields is due to fatter compensation for bearing risk  because the shifts in the two sets of yield curves did not match the spread between the nominal and the indexed yields which measures inflation compensation widened somewhat at longer maturities  here too the models suggest that some of that larger gap reflects a higher risk premiumthis time for bearing inflation riskleaving their estimates of inflation expectations only modestly higher
in recent days concern about risktaking brought into the spotlight by the problems of two hedge funds managed by bear stearns reversed some of the upward tug of yields imparted by the revision to the outlook for the economy and policy  as can be seen in the bottom left panel the cost of credit protection for subprime mortgage pools packaged over the past 1 years has risen over the past few weeks as the fear of a fire sale of the collateral seized by lenders to the bear stearns funds depressed prices and raised concerns about a more general spillover to other entities and markets  these fears also seem to have set off flighttosafety flows that pulled treasury yields lower in recent days  as noted in the table at the bottom right the
tenyear treasury yield had risen about 50 basis points from the may meeting to when we put the bluebook to bed the first column  the outbreak of skittishness in recent days trimmed several basis points off that runup the second column and put equity prices into the red  i wonder if the recentness of these events which unfolded after much of the staff briefing work was wrapped up and your own interventions were mostly written means that they have not been completely incorporated into your outlook  if so this nervousness in financial markets probably adds to the list of reasons for keeping a low profile in your policy action at this meeting by ratifying prevailing expectationsthat is to choose the unchanged policy stance of alternative b in the bluebook
some of the other reasons are the subject of exhibit 2  in the staff forecast summarized in the top left panel output growth runs a bit below that of its potential in the near term and inflation settles in at 2 percent  if you find that both a plausible and an acceptable outcome you might also align yourself with the policy assumption of an unchanged federal funds rate upon which that forecast is based  moreover you were satisfied with keeping the funds rate at 5 percent at your may meeting  if you have filtered the incoming economic information in a manner similar to the staff seen in the greenbook as a slight upward revision to the growth of real gdp and a slight downward revision to core pce inflationyou probably also believe that circumstances have not changed enough to warrant a recalibration of policy  it is true that financial market restraint has ratcheted up somewhat as investors forecast of the federal funds rate path has risenproxied in the top right panel by the yearend expected federal funds rate in futures marketsbut the staff expected this to happen over the next year or so which has been a sentiment shared by some of you at the past few meetings  the adjustment in financial markets over the intermeeting period now brings market pricing into better alignment with the greenbook assumption shown by the black dotsand that this adjustment took place on a more compressed schedule than expected should probably not make for a material change to the outlook  as seen in the middle panel the current real federal funds rate at
3 percent matches the greenbookconsistent estimate of its equilibrium level  that is if maintained the current real rate would be consistent with the output gap closing within three years at least in the greenbook outlook  an unchanged nominal funds rate at this meeting is also consistent with many policy rules including an estimated one that captures your practice over the past twenty years and that is plotted as the solid line in the bottom left panel  of course if you take into account forecast uncertainty as is done by the light and dark green regions you can pitch a pretty large tent with such policy rules  there is less doubt about the course of monetary policy in financial markets  as shown by the red bars at the bottom right options on eurodollar futures imply a distribution for the federal funds rate six months from now that is tightly clustered around the current setting  here might be another reason for keeping the fed funds rate unchanged today  for all this year you have been hinting that prevailing market expectations for the fed funds rate were too low  now that market participants have adjusted in your desired direction you might not want to surprise them

many of you noted that problem with the version of table 1 that circulated in the bluebook a subject discussed in exhibit 3  in the may statement inflation was characterized as somewhat elevated as in row 3 of the left column  but favorable data since then have put the twelvemonth change in core pce inflation at 2 percent  a level that some of you might find tolerable  as yet the committee has not spoken with one voice on the subject  we dropped that contentious phrase in the bluebook and softened the balanceofrisks language as well  as a result the release of the wording in the bluebook version of alternative b would likely trigger a decline in money market yields  the new version of alternative b in the right column turns the heat back up somewhat by inserting in row 3 words to the effect that the committee is not convinced that the present stepdown in inflation will persist  this draft also makes clear in row 2 that the characterization of recent economic growth is based on the first half of this year and returns the language in row 4 to that used in the may statement
even if you are willing to keep the funds rate at 5 percent for now you might foresee policy action sometime soon in which case the changes to the statement probably do not represent your views  in particular as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 4 the unemployment rate the red line has bounced around 4 percent for almost a year  if you believe that this represents a taut labor market you may be concerned about inflation pressures particularly given that the manufacturing sector seems to have gone into a higher gear as shown by recent readings on the isms new orders index the black line  you might not be alone in being concerned about inflation prospects  as plotted in the middle left panel fiveyear fiveyearforward inflation compensation has risen 30 basis points from its recent low  it might be noise it might be a wider risk premium or it might be increased inflation expectations  if it is the last you may want to position yourself now for policy firming sometime soon on the theory that an early demonstration of your displeasure with a rise in inflation expectations will effectuate a less costly decline  some suggestions for doing so were offered in alternative c in the bluebook a few highlights of which are given in the bottom left panel  in particular the alternative c draft reverses the order of the description of economic activity in row 2 to downplay the qualification despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector  more important it retains the judgment that core inflation remains somewhat elevated and gives more reasons that inflation many come under pressure  if you have a frame of mind favorable to finer shades of meaning you can always try dialing down the modifier of elevated inflation from somewhat to slightly
more substantial changes might be required if you are inclined toward alternative a arguments for which are shown in the righthand column  regardless of the reason behind the runup in market yields households borrowing to buy a house now face higher mortgage rates as shown in the top panel  this may both dissuade potential new purchasers of homes and disappoint those households that were hoping to refinance on morefavorable terms as the lockin periods on their extant arms end  both will act as a drag on spending and perhaps more substantially so than in the staff forecast  months supply of new homes plotted in
the middle right panel has edged higher  the staff projection has the feature that the efforts of builders to bring inventories back into line will be a drag on production for some time but that residential investment will begin to turn up by the second half of next year  however this is a projection and if you are more pessimistic on that score or want to give greater weight to downside possibilities from a riskmanagement standpoint you might want to show some leaning toward policy ease in the statement the language of the draft statement in alternative a may do so  as summarized in  the bottom right panel that draft pointed to ongoing weakness in the housing sector in row 2 excises the reference to somewhat elevated inflation in row 3 and moves the risk assessment to balance in row 4
the pieces of what i have just been talking about have been put together in your last exhibit which represents an eversoslightly revised version of table 1 that circulated on monday  in particular in row 3 of alternative b the word sustained has been inserted in the middle sentence to raise the bar as to what it takes for the committee to be convinced that inflation has moderated  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  are there any questions for vincent  all right  if
there are no questions then well adjourn  well see you at the dinner and we will begin at
900 am
meeting recessed
june 28 2007morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everyone  the gdp figures came
out this morning  david would you like to comment
mr wilcox  thank you mr chairman  the bea published this morning
their socalled final estimate of gdp for the first quarter  top line came in slightly lower
than we had been expecting in the greenbook07 percent compared with the 1 percent
that we had been expecting  there were small misses in a smattering of categories
including equipment and software investment net exports and inventories  our snap
reading though is that this release will have little if any implication for our outlook
what we lost in the first quarter in inventories for example we might be inclined to
regain in the second quarter in our projection  so we think that our projection for real
activity will not change as a consequence of this release  we did get the upward revision
to core pce prices that we had been expecting on the basis of the revision to the ppi for
medical services  core ppi was revised up from 22 to 24 percent
mr kroszner  core pce
mr wilcox  excuse me  the core pce price index for the first quarter was
revised up exactly as we had been expecting on the basis of the ppi revision  thank you
chairman bernanke  are there any questions
mr kohn  may i ask bill whether there has been any reaction in financial
markets to this
mr dudley  i think that people are taking this in stride  the first quarter is
old news
mr kroszner  so on your estimate what we will be seeing tomorrow when
we get the details on prices will be in line with what you have been expecting  there
was nothing here to make you change your view of that
mrwilcox  we dont know the details of what we will get tomorrow but
there is nothing here to condition our expectation any differently from what we had
before
chairman bernanke  okay  we are well advanced in our deliberations
here  we heard from vincent yesterday on the action in the statement and so we are
prepared for the goround  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think what i heard yesterday was
consistent with what i was thinking myself  we are in a pretty good spot
macroeconomically and policywise  we have moderate growth low core inflation
which is not rising and could possibly be falling suggesting an underlying balance of
demand and potential supply that is in pretty good shape  total inflation is high but
unless the futures markets are wrong again total inflation should come down to core and
core is telling us that the balance is about right  i didnt hear anything yesterday in the
forecast or in the anecdotessome were strong and some were weakto contradict this
picture or to suggest that we have any need to adjust policy  so i strongly support
alternative b
markets now roughly agree with our outlook at least in terms of their
expectations for the federal funds rate and judging from our submissions on the forecast
process  i dont think we should be trying to change those expectations  i share
everyones concerns around the table about the risks on inflation  even if i dont always
share everyones goal for where we might be going in the next few years i think the risks
are clearly pointed to the upside given the tightness of domestic and foreign markets and
the increase in headline inflation which could feed through to inflation expectations
i like the alternative b language as it was handed out by vincent yesterday  it is
consistent with yesterdays discussion that focuses on the forecast of inflation in sections
3 and 4  it reflects our unease about whether recent improvements will be sustained  i
think it should leave expectations approximately where they were although i dont have
any confidence whatsoever in that judgmenti have been wrong too often for too many
years on these things  i do think it has the virtue of reflecting our discussion yesterday  i
have one suggestion for sentence 3 in section 3 which i think makes it a little closer to
last time in terms of wording  in the second sentencehowever a sustained moderation
in inflationwell is that core or total  what is that about  i think we should go back
to inflation pressures  however a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet
to be convincingly demonstrated  that is what we talked about last timeinflation
pressures  then moreover the high level of resource utilization has the potential to
sustain those pressures  i dont think we need the word inflation twice  so with that
small amendment i think alternative b language should do the trick  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i agree with governor kohn  i am in favor of
alternative b of holding the rate where it is  the point that he just made may cover a
suggestion i had because i was thinking about what i heard yesterday at the table  i heard
two things  one in our discussion of inflation i heard some concern about core inflation
qua core inflation  i was going to suggest that the first sentence be modified slightly to
say that readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months but
measures of overall inflation have remained stubbornly high  then i would strike
however and just say a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be
convincingly demonstrated  i believe that is what i heard yesterday  the other music to
my ears but i think it also reflects realityand i hear it more at the tablewould be
amending slightly the last sentence in that section 3 to read moreover the high level of
global and domestic resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures
laughter  that is what we said  that is what we discussed  we acknowledge that  i
think it would show that were tuned in to whats going on and that would be my
recommendation  otherwise i would leave the rest of alternative b unchanged  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  before i talk about policy let me just
note that it has been a tremendous pleasure being a colleague of president minehan over
the years and being an immediate neighbor of herslaughterat federal open market
committee meetings  for one thing she has done a great job as buffer between me and
the president of the new york bank  laughter
ms minehan  not always easy i might add  laughter
mr lacker  for another i have gotten an upclose view of some really
dazzling jewelry  laughter
ms minehan  please take that out of the transcript  laughter
mr lacker  core inflation has come down recently  but as i mentioned
earlier my sense is that it could well rise again  in any event it doesnt seem likely to
fall much further  so i think we have to position ourselves to do something about
inflation when we are more certain that the soft patch is behind us  i support the actions
in alternative b  i support vince reinharts language from yesterday  i am sure there
will be more amendments put on the table  i dont want to start now by commenting on
everything that has been put on the table  i will just say that as we recognized at our last
meeting if inflation fell we would have a problem characterizing inflation and core pce
inflation has indeed fallen and could well go below that number on friday according to
the staff  so it seems appropriate to recognize that improvement
the difficulty of course is how to do so in a way that respects the fact that we
havent yet decided whether our objective for inflation is 1 or 2 percent  this is what
motivated my letter to the committee last week  i didnt think the first draft of
alternative b was sufficiently agnostic on the question  my advisers and i put our heads
together and we couldnt figure out a way to rewrite the statement to acknowledge the
decline but not tip our hand toward preferring one objective or another  so that is why in
my letter i proposed that we go ahead and make a decision by choosing between
language consistent with 1 and language consistent with 2  after all we are widely
seen to want an inflation rate between 1 and 2 and we communicated that via language in
our statement expressing displeasure with inflation below 1 and more recently
expressing displeasure with inflation above 2
sure enough however some people with far more expertise in the mysterious art
of drafting fomc statements seem to have found a way around this and the revised
statement seems to finesse this pretty wellthe language moderation in inflation has yet
to be convincingly demonstrated  in other words we dont have to say how we feel
about 2 percent inflation because we are not really sure that inflation is 2 percent yet
now i think this will finesse the problem for the time being  assuming that it does
finesse the issueand that is sort of a big ifi dont think we are likely to be able to
finesse this issue forever  if core inflation does spend some time near 2 percent as the
greenbook forecasts then eventually it will become convincingly demonstrated that
inflation is indeed 2 percent  more broadly the lack of a decision about our objective
will continue to pose difficulties both for our statement and our deliberations and i think
it is going to be increasingly unsatisfactory to say we are still thinking about it  so i hope
we can make progress on that soon  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i am very comfortable with our current stance at
5 percent  i think that it is as i have said before modestly restrictive and that it will
take us over time to a lower inflation rate
on the statement itself i have a couple of comments  i am a little uncomfortable
with the language used in the output rationale because we use the term moderate to
describe growth for the first half of this year and coming quarters and this suggests that
there will not be much change in growth going forward as we use moderate in both
places  so i would like if we could to have something in there that will describe the
pickup in activity from the second quarter on that we have talked about  this would
improve the characterization  that is just a suggestion  i know how hard it is to craft
these things but it is something to think about
on the inflation rationale ill make two points  one i think the statement carries
pretty wellthat is inflation has come down recently but we are not yet confident that
progress will be maintained  two on a twelvemonth basis core inflation is higher than
i find acceptable over the longer term and would like to see further progress toward price
stability  perhaps president fishers suggestions would take us closer to my preference in
terms of something more explicit that promotes further progress in reducing inflation
that would improve the statement  but as i said crafting these things is pretty difficult
i can live with the language as it is and those are just suggestions to think about as we go
forward from here  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well like others i think the case for
alternative b is convincing  i dont think we have any reason to contemplate changing
the fed funds rate target at this point or trying to change market expectations about what
we are up to  as far as the language is concerned something that came up at the last
meeting was not to make any more changes than are necessary  some changes clearly are
appropriate here because of the incoming data and the way they have influenced the
outlook  with that as a guiding principle i think alternative b as drafted is fine  i might
have a mild preference for the suggestion that governor kohn made  i think that on the
margin it is an improvement but i can live with b as drafted  i think we are into nuances
here that probably matter more to us than to anyone else  laughter
chairman bernanke  i am not so sure about that  laughter  thank you
president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i support alternative b and i also
support the slight revision in the wording that governor kohn recommended  one thing
that i worry about and that i hope we can make clear in the minutesclearly we couldnt
do it in the statementis that we have been in an unusual period  if you look at
greenbook part 1 the evolution of the staff forecast the staff forecast for both 07 and
08 has changed remarkably little since last september  there has been a 01 02 or 03
here but very very little change  ordinarily over this span of time you get some
information that changes your outlook in some significant way  i would hate to see us
encourage the market to think that our projected path of 5 percent for the fed funds rate
is carved in stone  we need the market to respond to incoming data as we will have to
do when we have some data that really move us off dead center  so i hope that we would
emphasizeand it has sort of drifted into insignificance herethat future policy
adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook  i think it is very important that
the market understands that  it gets into the broader discussion of communications but i
hope the minutes will emphasize the importance of that part of our statement  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  we have seen some change in policy
expectations obviously in the intermeeting period  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i am very comfortable with the
policy stancekeeping the rate at 5 percent  i think policy is in the right place  it is
moderately restrictive but not restrictive enough to cause us any problems particularly in
the housing area
in terms of the statement itself i am comfortable with alternative b as written or
as modified by don kohn  we could talk a bit more about where that word pressure
should be when you compare it with the last statement that we had but that is a very
minor point  the key in this statement is dealing with the fact that core inflation
according to our forecast is going to be 14 percent in the second quarter  it was 24 in
the first quarter 14 in the second and then it goes back up to 22 and 22  that is really
the key because when you see inflation improving and then going back up again and
juxtapose that against the longerterm forecast that we have come up with which shows
some improvement in inflation over time in 08 and 09 it is a delicate balance as to how
we present this in the statement  i think the way alternative b has been formulated
captures that  i had suggested a slightly different approach  i dont feel strongly about
this but you could also take that first sentence in section 3 which says readings on core
inflation have improved modestly in recent months and just add the phrase but part of
the improvement may be transitory  but as i said i am comfortable with either
formulation here  i think it accomplishes the same objective
mr poole  the minutes should certainly make that point because the staff has
emphasized that this may be transitory
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as people said before i too am in
favor of keeping the fed funds rate at 5 percent  the economy does seem to be
rebounding in the second quarter  the lingering uncertainty over housing suggests that
now is not the right time to take moreaggressive action  i am in agreement with that
however the most current readings on core inflation while they have been goodjust to
reiterate the pointi too believe there is a lot of evidence that it may be transitory and
we have to be very careful about the fact that headline inflation has not been very
cooperative recently  inflation expectations remain somewhat high from my perspective
and based on our previous discussions that is a worry for me  i do tend to favor our
announcing an inflation target  i am not yet convinced that we will see inflation
expectations where they need to be to achieve my goal by the end of 2009
if we look at the projection narratives prepared by the committee members we
see that a majority believe that the flat fed funds rate will get us to a pce core inflation of
2 percent or slightly less by 2009  if my own goal were 2 percent i might be more
comfortable with a flat fed funds rate going forward  in fact even the greenbook
suggests that there is a model where that could happen  the bottom line is that i think we
cant avoid the elephant in the room  how can we sensibly talk about the forecast and
appropriate policy choices either in real time as we do today or prospectively when we
cant articulate or agree upon what our objective is  in the absence of agreeing on a
numerical longrun inflation objective we as individual members face increasingly
difficult choices in arriving at an appropriate policy stance in any given meeting and even
greater difficulty conveying our committees decision to the public in an informative and
transparent manner
individuals could be advocating different policy paths either because they have
different models of the economy or different inflation goals or both  at a minimum i
believe it would help our internal deliberationsand it would certainly help mineif the
causes of these differences in our projections were more transparent  if we are thinking
about our forecast as a communication device this would seem to even be more
imperative  that brings me to language  i think the language in the revised alternative b
is incredibly well crafted and it tries to get around the problem that we are facing in
dealing with what we meant by elevated and how we think about this going forward
citing growth over the past two quarters as having been moderate is a step in the right
direction because it encourages the public and the markets to look through shorterrun
transitory movements  similarly we need to be looking through transitory movements in
inflation as well  as several of you have pointed out in your comments on the proposed
statement language before the meeting and as vince pointed out in our last fomc
meeting how we characterize the inflation outlook in our statements going forward is
becoming increasingly an issue since we have not agreed on what our objective is
i have two related concerns  the first is that in eliminating elevated we run
the risk of signaling to the market that we are satisfied with the current rate of inflation
even though we havent communicated what that means  are we looking forward twelve
months  two years  three years  are we looking backward at the past three months or
the past twelve months  are we basing our judgment on forecasts of the next twelve
months  are we concerned only about the core pce or are we concerned about headline
pce or some version of the cpi that is relevant to our concept of inflation  as i said
yesterday my concern is that there is considerable confusion in the marketplace about
why we focus on core and what it means to us and how we communicate that  internally
we are not clear on these issues so how do we expect the public to divine our meaning
when we are not willing to do it internally  in essence i think there will be a great deal
of speculation even with this language about what we mean  will the market conclude
what we think it should or will we just accept whatever the market divines our intentions
to be
my second concern about changing the language dramatically is that it might
convey to the market the notion that we are satisfied with inflation at current levels  we
may reveal through our projections next month that we actually are forecasting inflation
to be lower than it is today on a twelvemonth basis  this was the point that president
yellen made in her memo  it creates somewhat of a contradiction in how we describe our
current views  if the market infers that we are satisfied with a yearoveryear core at
2 percent and then our forecasts come in at 18 or whatever i think that will send some
confusing messages  on the other hand releasing the forecast later may clarify for the
market what we are expecting and that may be the interpretation  but there is no way for
us to know what the outcome of that is without being more specific about what our
objectives are  why do we want to create that much confusion and speculation in the
marketplace about what we mean  i understand the desire to extricate ourselves from the
language about core inflation but i think we are being unnecessarily confusing and
cryptic in our choice of language and it will be difficult for us to control those
expectations given the way we are trying to manage the language
i am not going to get engaged in all the details of the wording  there must be
people who are better at that than i am  but i would just like to conclude by noting that
even if we are successfuland indeed we may be with the current language in
alternative bin wordsmithing ourselves around this delicate problem it is not going to
go away  we will continue to grapple with it in this environmentand we are going to
continue to be pushed by the markets by commentators to clarify what in fact we mean
so the problem isnt going to go away even if we sort of finesse our way around it in the
short run  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also support the policy action in
alternative b  i have some of the same concerns that president lacker and president
plosser and also president yellen in her letter raised about the increasing difficulty in
characterizing inflation without having a clear sense of the committees longerterm
objective on inflation  i also mentioned yesterday that i have some concerns about
claiming that inflation has moderated at the same time that we see the headline measure
rising  i find this to be a real problem and i therefore like the suggestion that president
fisher made  however i am concerned about introducing yet another concept or another
measure of inflation in our statement  i hope that through the minutes we will be able to
raise our concern about the headline measure staying stubbornly high  but without
further communication introducing yet another concept or another measure of inflation
in our statement is going to confuse markets  so i support making as little change as we
can to the statement and i am comfortable with the way the most recent alternative b is
presentedalthough i can also support governor kohns suggestion about the word
pressure  so i support alternative b with some of the minor changes that governor
kohn has made  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you mr chairman  i too am in favor of keeping
policy where it is  as i stated yesterday i see the risks around growth as better balanced
than they were even given the potential for the housing problems to be deeper and
longerlasting than we might have expected earlier in the year  i remain concerned about
the risks that inflation will not continue to moderate but i am not wed as i have said
many times to a particular low number  i would be as happy at 2 as at 1 and perhaps
even happier given that levels that start with 1 seem to have downside risksor at least
they did the last time we were there
i am concerned however about the pressures on the economy whether you think
of them in terms of headline inflation or in terms of the components of headline
particularly energy costs tight labor markets and a growing world  i think although we
may not want to put it in the statement that richard is rightour economy is subject to
pressures from the rest of the world at this point and related to that the falling dollar  a
lot of things could take inflation from its current moderate level and push it back up and
that i would be very concerned about  it is true that financial conditions have tightened
slightly so markets are starting to do a little work for us  but i believe that we need to
continue with policy in a slightly restrictive stance to provide some insurance that the
inflation pressures in the economy stay moderate  staying with current policy is a good
balance between the prospects we see for moderate growth and the prospects we also
have recognized around the table for the potential for inflation pressures to get worse
i support alternative bs language  i want to say two things  first the more
substantive concerni think that governor kohns thoughts about inflation pressures are
slightly better than the current language  i was attracted to the transitory language that
i think president moskow raised first and we fiddled around with it a bit in boston but i
have been convinced that convincingly demonstrated and transitory are equivalent
laughter  so i dont want to battle about that at this table  the statement in section 3 is
headed in the right direction and i would be in favor of its current form or the form that
governor kohn suggested  second i may be the only one sensitive to this but in section
2 we have two sentences that start with exactly the same words  i never wrote that way
when i was in school  laughter  there is an easy way to make that sentence a little
better from an english composition point of view  but again that is tricky to argue
about at the table so i guess i am fine
chairman bernanke  how about something like economic growth
proceeded at a moderate pace
ms minehan  there are many ways to do it  i know that there are some
objections to this but you could say despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing
sector the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace over the first half of this
year and seems likely to continue growing moderately over the coming quarters  you
could make it one sentenceit is simple it is shorter and it reads better
vice chairman geithner  we are talking about the economy so
mentioning it twice seems to be reasonable  laughter
ms minehan  we have two sentences starting exactly the same way though
in any event this is a nit in the overall scheme of things
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i too favor alternative b and the
current policy stance  my interpretation of the discussion around the table yesterday is
that we see encouraging signs that the current policy appears to be producing the desired
directional effects at least or intermediate effects so it seems to be working  there is
still a fair degree of uncertainty and based upon my long experience i think it is a
normal amount of uncertainty  so the current policy deserves being held
regarding the policy statement i favor the wording in revised alternative b that
was distributed by vince yesterday afternoon because i think it captures the key points
the ones that are important to me at leastand they are moderate growth prospects
mention of the housing sector better inflation readings and prospects of continued
moderation though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions continued inflation
pressures and a continued weighting to inflation risks with no suggestion that the current
levels around 2 percent are acceptable for the long term  so for that set of reasons i
favor the wording as presented
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i certainly agree that policy is well
positioned and we should leave it exactly where it is  markets have come around to our
view and i think our objective in the statement should be to keep market expectations
aligned with our view and not to change them
in terms of the statement i think that the current draft is very much improved
relative to the bluebook and i have no problem in supporting the current language  i like
governor kohns proposal i think that it is a worthwhile change  i do however share
many of president plossers concerns and think that we will have a lot of difficulty going
forward  markets are wondering what our longrun inflation objective is  they will
certainly note the omission of the term somewhat elevated  it will raise a question
about whether if core inflation were to stabilize at 2 percent we would be satisfied with
that or we would want to see it move lower  this statement is very cleverly crafted and i
think it succeeds in finessing that issue for today  i dont have a problem really with
finessing it for today
my own proposal was designed to say to markets something that i thought we
could say without actually coming to full agreement even within the committee about
whether we have a single longrun inflation objective  even if we dont go announce a
numerical inflation objective our statements need to be consistent with the projections
that we will be issuing publicly  president plosser pointed out that we will be issuing a
twoyear projection that does show inflation coming down  it seemed to me that we
could therefore remove the term elevated and still say as our projections in a couple
weeks will confirm that the committee expects underlying inflation to come down
further without saying exactly how far  but i dont feel strongly about such language
and i think alternative b does a good job of resolving the problem for today  we will
wait until another day when we will have to face this again
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  like many of you i see no reason to
materially change market expectations about our policy action  it is important that we
not appear more comfortable with either the level or the trend of inflation than we
actually are  any nods in that direction in the statement are ripe to be misinterpreted and
the process of fixing any such nod would be tricky  yesterday vice chairman geithner
said that financial markets are in a delicate place and i would say that is particularly
relevant in the context of this statement  so i would try not to mess with market
expectations given what we know about the state of our financial markets  all that
having been said i support alternative b  i like governor kohns amendment and i still
think we are running a bit of a risk in suggesting to the markets that we are more
comfortable  but i dont think there is really much we can do at this point to mitigate
that risk more than the kohn amendment suggests  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  as i mentioned yesterday i think we
have seen some very welcome signs of moderation but it is certainly too early to declare
a victory  that is certainly very clear in the greenbook as many of you emphasized  i
also agree with governor kohn that we are in a reasonably good spot with moderate
growth likely going forward and inflation and inflation expectations reasonably
contained  it is reasonable to think that they may be going down but theres a lot of
uncertainty and most of the uncertainty is to the upside  it is sensible to acknowledge
reality and we should take out the word elevated so that we are not seen as inflation
nutters  we should acknowledge that some of the numbers have come down but be
careful about saying that we are done we are happy or we are satisfied
as i mentioned yesterday an upturn in owners equivalent rent could be coming
there could be some uncertainty about passthrough to core of the higher energy prices
that we have been seeing  there is continued strong world demand and there could be
some lagged passthrough effects of the previous declines in the dollar  i see all those as
risks to the upside and so i think its important to convey that we are still concerned
about those things  that said i am very supportive of where we are with alternative b in
terms of both the policy and the message that is coming from it
the type of amendment that governor kohn mentioned is one that i very much
support for a number of reasons  one as he mentioned it is more forward looking  i
think it is much better to talk about a sustained moderation in inflation pressures rather
than inflation because that gets us out of explaining specifically what we mean by
inflation  its a little bit more general  if we had a clear goal it would be beneficial
given that we dont have a clear goal i think talking about pressures is good  it also has
the value of being forward looking  two the amendment fits with president sterns
notion that we should try to keep as much in parallel with the previous statement  so
mentioning moderation in inflation pressuresim not sure i wrote down properly
whether governor kohn suggested in the final sentence of section 3 the potential to
sustain those pressures taking it back parallel to what we had before or whether he said
sustain inflation  so i would certainly agree with those pressures  three putting in
pressures gets us out of the potential for getting stuck  here we are saying sustained
moderation in inflation has yet to be convincingly demonstrated  well if we take that
out at some point then we will be admitting that it has been convincingly demonstrated
or at least markets might interpret us as saying that  i think that gets us into a bit more of
a box than i would like and so talking about inflation pressures avoids the markets
taking an implication that if we remove that at some point we have said okay  it is
convincingly demonstrated when for six months it is below x or below y  i think since
we havent articulated a goal yet we dont want to get into that box but i do think that
would be one of the values of articulating a goal  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you  i support alternative b with the amendment that
governor kohn suggested so i am very comfortable with that  the real issue for me here
is one that i think has been expressed by several others what president plosser called the
elephant in the room which is that writing the statement is getting harder and harder  i
think that we have a brilliant fudge this time around but it is not going to work forever
there are two senses in which i have a problem with this statement  one is the
issue of the appropriate level of inflation that we should be shooting for  this is really
two separate questions  one is what we do about communication outside but there is
also an issue about consensus inside the committee  i would find it much easier to agree
to statements of certain types if in fact there were a consensus  as many of you know i
am actually comfortable with an inflation number of 2 percent  on the other hand if the
committee comes to consensus for a lower number i would be more than happy to be
comfortable with that  in fact i would be willing to have a statement that would reflect a
lower number  i sense that this is true for other members of the committeesome who
might be caught on the dovish side with 2 percent while some members are on the
hawkish side at 1  but the difference between the hawks and the doves here is
extremely slight  in fact from more than five feet away you couldnt tell the difference
between a hawk and a dove  laughter  thats one issue that is very important  i think
it is going to become more and more difficult as we go forward as long as inflation
evolves in the way that we expect  i mean we could have bad newsinflation could
actually start risingand wed have a different kind of a problem  but lets hope we
dont get into that problem  we want dealing with the good news to be the problem
the second issue relates to core versus total  i am quite concerned about the
emphasis on core not because i dont think it is very important to communicate about
core particularly when you get a big shift in something like energy prices and you dont
want to unhinge inflation expectations  in that context we need to talk about core so that
people understand that the currently high inflation rates in terms of things they care
aboutgoing to the gas station or going to the supermarketare not actually something
that should change their longrun inflation expectations  thats why the use of the core
measure makes a lot of sense  the problem is as i read the research that no one measure
of core will always be good  in fact the core measure that we have evolved to has a lot
of history behind it but it is not clear that it will be the best measure in all cases  there
are certain alternatives that i think will work in some casesa trimmed mean may
sometimes be appropriate but at other times it will not  so i think there will be a key
problem as has been discussed today which is that at times one core measure may make
more sense than another core measure  our whole discussion is very much in terms of a
particular core measure that excludes food and energy  that measure will sometimes be
problematic for telling us about longrun trends particularly if we think that energy
changes are more permanent or crazy policies about ethanol may be having a more
permanent effect in terms of food prices  in this context we are going to have to deal
with exactly this issue going forward  also a problem is that people do consume a lot of
food and energy and it is very peculiar to act as though we dont care about that
so i think that we have to grapple with these issues  they are part of our
communication issues  the bottom line is that we are fooling ourselves if we think that
we are going to get away forever with not dealing with them  we will have to figure out
some way of doing this  i think that we can do it because in my reading of what people
on the committee have been saying the differences here are actually fairly minor  it is
the outside world that wants to make them into a big deal because doing so sells
newspapers  but we do need to get to some consensus on these issues so that the outside
world sees that the committee actually has unity rather than differences  thank you very
much
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin and others have
referred to communication issues  id just point out that we will be addressing some of
those later this morning  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  i actually agree withand am happy
associating myself withmuch of what has been said  i am totally comfortable with
alternative b as amended by don or with the kohnkroszner amendment because you
dont need to repeat inflation twice in the end laughter and i think we should keep
the rate as it is
mr kroszner  tim im sorry i heard my name but i didnt hear what you
said about me  laughter
chairman bernanke  change the word inflation to those
vice chairman geithner  several of you put on the table a bunch of
broader questions about communication going forward which i would like to talk about
now but i think we should defer that until we come to the later conversation  so i am
fine with alternative b as amended
i do think that a lot of you made many interesting suggestions about the language
but there is much virtue in making minimal changes at the meeting because even if they
sound small i think it is hard in the few minutes we have before we vote to really step
back take stock and ask whether we altered the balance in ways that we fully intended to
be understood  thus i would be for minimalism in changes at the table generally unless
we have something really consequential that we are trying to shift in the statement  in
that spirit i would keep the changes small and stay with a modest amendment to
alternative b
chairman bernanke  thank you  well we appear to be in considerable
agreement about the policy action  laughter  it is a good thing i guess  not only are
we in agreement but also the bond market is in agreement  laughter  i would just note
that in fact the bond market is acting as an automatic stabilizer responding to news as
we have discussed before  i think we are in a very good place and our forecasting
process has served us very well  in that respect i think this might be an appropriate time
to congratulate the staff including dave stockton karen johnson vincent reinhart and
the research directors at the reserve banks who are here for their tremendous
contributions to this process which has really been instrumental in helping us find the
right level of policy and in building a lot of credibility in the market  so thank you very
much for your outstanding work
with respect to the statement also i didnt hear a lot of dissent  first of all let me
say that i think governor kohns amendments in section 3 are very much to the point
so that would be a sustained moderation in inflation pressures  first the word
pressures dilutes to some extent the attention to the monthly numbers  second as a
number of people have said it is a broader concept and it can be construed as including
some of the headline issues and the oil commodities and so on prices that we are
concerned about  so i think it is definitely an improvement and so i would like to
recommend it
on section 2 just a couple things  one is that i would hesitate to try to indicate
growing strength in the second half for a couple of reasons  first at least in terms of the
greenbook that acceleration is relatively modestcertainly not at all a definite uptick
by continuing to use the language of moderate pace i think we signal that we are not
going to take the second quarter as necessarily indicating a new reacceleration of growth
we think that the second quarter represents at least partly a transitory increase in the
growth rate  second professor minehan laughter was correct about the quality of
writing in the section  the last statement began with the term economic growth  i am
kind of ambivalent about whether or not to do this but we could say economic growth
appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year despite the ongoing
adjustment in the housing sector
ms minehan  that works
chairman bernanke  a little more variationis that acceptable
mr moskow  could you read that again
chairman bernanke  the proposal is economic growth appears to have
been moderate and then it goes on as it says here during the first half of this year
despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector  i see nodding so i think that is
accepted  im sorry  no
mr kroszner  there is a tense question  the first half of the year isnt over
chairman bernanke  yes it isalmost  laughter  well i mean that is
no different from what we already have
mr mishkin  its the word appears which is fine
chairman bernanke  the content is no different
mr kroszner  okay
chairman bernanke  is everyone okay with the language
ms minehan  yes  well at least that solves the instant problem
mr mishkin  you do know that english professors get paid very little money
laughter
ms minehan  that is what im going tovery little money  laughter
chairman bernanke  i think president minehan is entitled to her change
given that she is valedictory in this  laughter  so with that changeeconomic growth
appears to have been moderate during the first half et ceterathat would be my
recommendation  are there any further comments
mr plosser  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  just a clarification  on section 3 can somebody just read that
complete section as now amended
chairman bernanke  the entire statement the federal open market
committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5 percent
economic growth appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year despite
the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector  the economy seems likely to continue to
expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters  readings on core inflation have
improved modestly in recent months  however a sustained moderation in inflation
pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated  moreover the high level of resource
utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures  the last section is the same
mr plosser  this is just one observation  the second sentence of section 3
where we talk about capacity utilization seems to be redundant once you put inflation
pressures in the first sentence
chairman bernanke  well look at the may statement  we have been
doing that for a while now  laughter  are there any other questions or comments  if
not id like to call for a vote
ms smith  i will be reading the directive from page 29 of the bluebook  the
federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster
price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun
objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets
consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5 percent
and the risk assessment in these circumstances the committees predominant
policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  future
policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and
economic growth as implied by incoming information
chairman bernanke              yes vice chairman geithner      yes president hoenig                  yes
governor kohn                    yes
governor kroszner               yes
president minehan                yes
governor mishkin                yes
president moskow                yes
president poole                     yes
governor warsh                   yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  the coffee is not yet brewed
laughter  so why dont we go on to the next phase of the meeting  we turn to vincent
to discuss communication issues
mr reinhart5  thank you mr chairman for giving me the normal role as speed bump  in that effort we are now handing out material to which we will be referring  if someone will let me know when the doughnut truck comes ill pick up

5  material used by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 5
the pace  laughter  the subcommittee on communications began its work only fifteen months ago laughter which seems like yesterday at least in geological time  given the considerable discussion the committee has had since then on its communication policies it seemed appropriate to take stock  in particular i sent around a list of questions designed to elicit your views on the potential roles of the survey of economic projections the minutes and the statement in refining your dialogue with the public  the material with the cover fomc communications is designed to help to organize this discussion
with regard to the enhanced economic projections process the survey results circulated on june 15 reported general support for the key features of the process with three notable exceptions given at the top of exhibit 1  the subcommittee tried to address those concerns in the modified projections process used for this meeting so the first question listed at the top of your first exhibit boils down to how did they do  did the changes address the concerns you expressed in answer to the may survey  in particular some of you preferred not to share your forecast submissions mostly on the grounds that it might make the discussion of the economic outlook at the meeting more inflexible  but some of you held that sharing was important both to help inform your internal deliberations and as a source of material for the forecast writeup  as a compromise the submissions were circulated on an anonymous basis with an optout clause that one of you took this time  some of you were concerned about specificityparticularly in writing down an explicit path for the federal funds rate and in quantifying uncertainty  those questions were turned into qualitative ones that asked for comparisons with the staff policy assumption and historical uncertainty
another process question is item 2  in what form should the projections be released  debbie dankers memo identified the three options listed in the exhibit which basically differ by the extent to which the narrative description is tailored to suit different purposes  option 1 is onesizefitsall  the staff would produce a single document describing your economic projections which would be dropped into the committeeapproved minutes and repeated verbatim in the boardapproved monetary policy report  the chief advantages of this option are that the vetting process is tried and true and that there will be consistency across federal reserve documents  the disadvantage is familiar to anyone who has bought clothes off the rack in a big box retailerthe fit will not be perfect across documents  option 2 opens the door to some variety  the committeeapproved minutes would include a brief description of the forecasts as is the practice now  a separate document would give a fuller account of the projections  in that case there would be more flexibility as to who approves the document and when it is released  this poses a tradeoff that has come up in previous discussions in that the earlier the narrative is released the more useful it will be in explaining the policy decision but the more complicated the governance process will be  option 3 is the bespoke alternative in which separate complete discussions would be prepared for the minutes and the monetary policy report  the fit will be better but carrying it out will be more expensive and even subtle differences may draw attention
the third question asks when the projections should be finalized  the choices essentially are the day of the meeting the end of the week of the meeting or as late as practicable to be close to the official release of the document  but you have a more fundamental question to answer first  what is the purpose of the economic projections  if they are supposed to help explain your most recent policy choice they should be conditioned on the same information set that the policy decision is  that is they should be finalized as soon as possible after the meeting so that they are not contaminated by postdecision information  that is the rule we now use for the minutes  if in contrast the committees objective is to release an uptodate assessment that sheds light on future policy actions then the individual projections should be nailed down only close to publication day  the middle ground of closing the books on the projections a few days after the meeting seems unsustainable to me particularly if the narrative description is to be included in the minutes  the first time an important piece of news hits within the window between policy decision and update deadline the explanation of the policy action will become muddled  some immediate feedback on that score will be helpful because the schedule for this round allows for your projections to be updated through close of the week  if so you would seem to have to incorporate fridays chockfull data calendar  do you really want to do that particularly as it may lead to confusion in the minutes about what you knew and when you knew it
the next exhibit focuses on the minutes  you have 2 years of experience under your belt in publishing the minutes three weeks after the day of the policy decision  in that time the document has received more attention from you in the editing process and from market participants and the press on its release compared with the previous regime of delaying publication until after the next meeting  how  do you assess the benefits and costs of further expediting the minutes  the benefits listed at the left are the same as discussed in 2004  a document made public closer to the day of the decision will be more of an aid to the private sector in understanding the current outlook and the prospects for policy  in that regard you will be able to use that material from the minutes for public statements more promptly  a speedier release may facilitate making the postmeeting statement shorter or less substantive  i point out though that my sense in 2004 was that a few of you supported expediting the minutes in the hope that the statement would subsequently be shortened but that did not pan out  to appreciate the costs listed at the right you should understand that we use the three weeks after the meeting partly to accommodate your busy schedules and partly to provide a cushion so that the drafting iterations can converge without a dissenting vote  the costs then would include your increased effort to ensure that your schedules align with that of the drafting and approval process for the minutes
you should also recognize that less drafting time might lead to more compromises that make the minutes less informative so as to avoid dissent and more staff resources will be needed to prevent errors  simply put with fewer hours we need more eyes looking at the document
of course the decision on expediting the minutes further may interact with other potential decisions on communication policies especially those regarding the
enhanced projections process  in particular if you decide to include a narrative description of your forecasts in the minutes you may want to delay any speedingup of the minutes until you are comfortable with the new process  you may also want to consider ways to make drafting and commenting easier  that is the subtext underlying question 5  how do you assess the current content of the minutes including the staffs description of recent data  some time ago it was suggested that the first eight to ten pages which provide a backwardlooking review of recent economic data be relegated to an annex  in a similar vein it could be described explicitly as a staff summarywith its production perhaps even linked up mechanically to a modified part 2 of the greenbook  that way you would be responsible for commenting only on the forwardlooking and policy portions of the document and some of the pressures on staff time could be relieved  if you have any other views on the content of the minutes today probably would be an appropriate time to raise them
the last exhibit raises issues that have not been addressed for some time namely the role of the postmeeting statement  some of you might consider the statement as  a vehicle designed only to convey coarse signals about policy with morenuanced information provided in subsequent communications  others might see it as important that the statement be able to stand on its own as a reasonably complete explanation of the committees monetary policy decisions and intentions  what is the appropriate role of the statement in light of the changes to the committees other communication devices question 6  the statements role which can be described  in terms of a monetary policy rule has varied over the years  at times the statement has provided hints about the odds on future action by characterizing the lefthand side of the policy rulethat is by directly addressing the path of the federal funds rate
at times the statement has described the righthand side of the policy rulethat is the risks to the dual macroeconomic objectives  that is another way of stating question 7  if you believe that the statement should provide guidance about the outlook should that guidance be couched in terms of the policy interest rate or the dual objectives  if you decide to describe the economic outlook you will have to settle on the policy assumption underlying that projection as in question 8  the conditioning possibilities include the appropriate path of monetary policy some reading on market expectations or an unchanged policy rate  this choice may interact with the role you envisage for your economic projections in explaining policy decisions
as for question 9 your ambition regarding the complexity of the statement will determine how much time needs to be devoted to drafting  because of constraints as to how long you can meet as a group a complicated statement necessitates pre meeting consultation  that may get the nuance right but it may also force you to settle on a policy view before you have had the benefit of consulting with your colleagues on the committee  moreover it shifts some of the policy discussion out of this room for which a transcript is kept and minutes are produced and into informal back channels  a statement that could be agreed upon mostly within the confines of
these four walls is probably one that is short and relays a routinized risk assessment given your longheld view that nineteen people cannot edit the statement on the fly
question 10 raises one last governance issue  who owns the statement  at the inaugural of the age of statements in 1994 the committee formally directed the chairman to explain its policy action  over the years the statement has come to be viewed as a committee product with the words sometimes viewed to be at least as important as the immediate policy action  but you still vote only on the policy action and the risk assessment  should that continue or should you be asked to vote on the statement in its entirety
these three sets of questions are interrelated and there is no obvious place to wade into this thicket  one possibility would be to conduct two gorounds on these issues with the first covering your views on the enhanced forecast and the minutes and the second addressing the statement  the first two issues are closely related and perhaps closer to closure  i suspect that you are closer to the beginning of your discussion of the statement than to the end  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any questions  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  vince its a little unclear from what youve
circulated what the subcommittee is recommending or presuming about the pieces of
material that would go into the monetary policy report  do you want to say just a little
about options there  i assume you want people to comment on that question too and that
goes to the core of this next stage of evolution in the transparency
mr reinhart  thats a complicated governance issue because it relates to both
what the committee approves potentially and what the board approves because the
monetary policy report is by law a report of the board of governors explaining the
monetary policy actions of the committee  the short answer is that it depends on what you
want  one possibilitythats option oneis to write a narrative included in the minutes
have it approved by the committee and then essentially lift that out and make that a
significant chunk of part 1 of the semiannual monetary policy report  then the words
would be the same in both places
vice chairman geithner  those choices i think i understand but i was
really thinking about the pictures  you circulated a whole different set of new things
innovative pictures that showed dispersion uncertainty balance of risk histograms and so
forth  i guess you dont need to answer this question but do you want people to react in the
first round at least with a view on which pictures we think should be part of the narrative
mr reinhart  if you dont express a view here youll have a chance in
commenting on what the staff proposes  our intention was to take a small subset of those
charts and tables that were essential for explaining the central tendency projections
themselves and the dispersion of views and to put them into the narrative  the draft that we
would circulate to you would have that information and from there we could take your
comments
vice chairman geithner  how small a subset
mr reinhart  about the same size as the last draft we circulated which was in
fact circulated as an appendix in debbie dankers memo
vice chairman geithner  i didnt mean that  im sorry  i meant the graph
showing the evolution of the central tendency with things plus the histograms  thats what
i meant by subset
mr reinhart  yes
mr fisher  excuse me but the histograms were talking about are the individual
differences
mr reinhart  yes  well thats what we circulated last time in the draft write
up of the may discussion
mr fisher  so you would have the central tendency analysis that we have and
then further amplification which would show individual differences of the nineteen
members of the committee
mr reinhart  potentially thats what we would have
mr fisher  im just trying to understand what were going to talk about
mr reinhart  the staff draft of the june narrative will be similar in structure to
the may narrative  that however is only the first draft  given that we intended it to be
similar in structure to the may narrative then we would include a couple of histograms  we
also added in this package a revised picture of the central tendencyyou know the red bars
and the box and whiskers chart  we intended to include that  so we didnt view any
material upgrade in the pictorial description of the forecast  we tried to come up with as fat
a package as we could for your internal discussion so that you could see how the individual
forecasts of your colleagues vary and also are relatedfor instance between the
unemployment rate and the growth rate and between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  i think governor mishkin preceded me
chairman bernanke  were having questions for vincent now
ms minehan  this is just an intervention
chairman bernanke  i think i had president poole first and then governor
mishkin  president poole
mr poole  vince in thinking about the possible benefits of accelerating the
release of the minutes can you name a time when that would have produced a benefit  i
understand the cost because we all understand the costs but i dont know of any case in
which releasing the minutes five days earlier would have bought us anything  at any rate
we need to think that through before we bear all those costs
mr reinhart  the particular cases that i can imagine would be employment
reports  if it takes five fewer business daysand that might be a little speedier than the staff
can actually deliverany cutting of those business days particularly if it gets past that
friday produces the chance that there would be another employment report between your
policy decision and the release of the minutes  this also interacts with the chairmans
testimony schedule which is something we have to think about  do you want to be in the
position of having the minutes more likely to be out before his testimony or would you
prefer to have the minutes out after the testimony  i can imagine both benefits and costs
associated with that
mr poole  it probably would be helpful if we could have more detail with regard
to how that might work and how often those cases would arise because the costs would
occur continuously  as you emphasized there are also some risks to accelerating the
minutes because doing so reduces the amount of time to think it all through and make sure
that nothing has slipped through inadvertently
mr reinhart  there were a couple of statistics in debbies memo in particular
about how it interacts with the standard semiannual testimony schedule
mr poole  another observation somewhat in the same veinregarding the
economic projections as i commented earlier we have been thinking about this during a
period in which the forecast hasnt changed much  the situation has been pretty benign
from the point of view of anybody who has been doing this for very long  one thing that  i
think we need to work on is how this would have workedwould it likely have been
constructiveat a time like the fall of 1998 the time of september 11 2001 or the time in
early 2001 when the economy was sinking really rapidly  we need to work on those cases
and not just think about the projections in the context of the relatively benign period that
weve had  i realize that that involves more staff work but it seems to me essential that we
think all of that through before we start to do it
one other comment  i view the whole communication process that weve been
going through as incremental and im a little worried that were biting off too much at once
here  we should think about a really pared down set of releases here if were going to
expand the process with the idea if all that works well then wed take the next step
chairman bernanke  let me just say that theres going to be a goround
everyone will have an opportunity
mr poole  well im sort of asking him to reflect on that  laughter
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin do you have a question
mr mishkin  yes i do have a questionjust a clarification  one thing that we
talked about early on when you gave us information was that there is the information
regarding our views about whether risk was greater or less than usual and about the
skewness of the risk  you might also want to include in the documents that would go out
information to guide people on what is normal so that you would have the things that we
actually sent out which was either a picture or the table showing the forecast errors  is it
your view that part of it would be not only the charts that we actually responded to but also
the background information
mr reinhart  right  i believe the table of uncertainty was one thing that the
subcommittee viewed as useful to include not the three big fat bars that showed uncertainty
variable by variable  that was useful background for writing the paragraphs in the narrative
that talked about the committees perceptions of risks
mr mishkin  im just trying to rememberdid the table have the uncertainty for
the variables
mr reinhart  the table had historical variability coming from a couple of
different sources
mr mishkin  the greenbook and frbus
mr reinhart  right  that would be a reference table in the writeup  the
narrative would say in the committees view current uncertainty was about at historical
experience  then in the narrative description of the risks wed use the information that
you provided about the asymmetries of those risks  i dont think we envisioned showing a
particular chart
mr mishkin  right but the key idea is that we do have a table with actually
some numbers as part of the document  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  president minehan  im sorry  you had an
intervention
ms minehan  thats all right  i have one question and a plea  the question is
have we decided about how many times were doing these forecasts and i just missed the
decision
mr reinhart  no
ms minehan  will we be meeting four times a year
chairman bernanke  thats what we have to discuss  thats on the table
ms minehan  okay  it didnt seem to fall into this huge list of things  the plea
is please tell us what you want us to focus on first  theres so much stuff here that goes
into the heart of every communication issue that weve talked about over more than the past
eighteen months  do you have in mind a plan of action for which you need us to weigh in
on something first and then other things second and third
mr kohn  our hope was that we could come close to closure on enhanced
projections
ms minehan  okay
mr kohn  that led naturally into the minutes because the projections writeup
would be in the minutes  the statement would be put off for a second round and i
personally wouldnt be surprised if we never got to the second round  laughter  we could
try  i think we should focus first on the projectionswhats in themand then how they
might relate to the production of the minutes
ms minehan  so really to home in on what we all want to see out of the
projections is job number one
mr kohn  right  we would like to come out of this with some decisions made
about the way forward
ms minehan  okay
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  is the subcommittee making a recommendation on any of these
mr kohn  no  all along weve viewed our job as bringing things to the table
and helping the fomc to make the decisions and not making recommendations and weve
stuck with that  janet is rolling her eyes  laughter
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  this may get us slightly ahead of ourselves but i
think its important to what were asked to do now  it makes sense to get people to focus on
how comfortable they are with what has been on the table regarding the range of options on
projections and to say what theyre comfortable with and what theyre not comfortable with
but as i see this plan youre still building in some time for refinement over the next several
months to get this to the point where its ready for prime time  so i dont think youre
asking peopleyou really cant because youre not quite there yetto commit right now to
views on all specific attributes of this  it seems to me youre a step short of that  broad
elements of the package on projections would then provide a basis for the subcommittee and
the staff to refine this further over the next several months  thats what i understood the
plan to be  i think youre right cathytheres a lot here  you can get a lot from asking
people to give that broader orientation and still recognize that this is going to need a little
refinement  is that fair don
mr kohn  yes  as vincent pointed out well have another round a practice
round this time and maybe even another one
chairman bernanke  are there other questions for vincent
mr kohn  i had mr chairman a timing question  vincent you said that
including the writeup of the projections with the minuteseither as a separate document or
integratedmight argue for not shortening the time  but how could we do that with the
chairmans testimony  doesnt that actually force the shortening of the time
mr reinhart  well i would make a distinction between when the committee
approves the document and when the committee releases the document publicly  you
might not want for instance to release the minutes before the chairmans testimony
because it does sort of step on that message
mr kohn  i agree with that
mr reinhart  but if the writeup is in committeeapproved minutes and a
boardapproved monetary policy report youre going to have to figure out a mechanism
by which the committee signs off on the writeup so that it will be the same in the report
the possibilities are that if it is an annex or a dropin portion of the minutes the committee
may very well need to have two editing schedulesthat is comments on the narrative
would have to be finalized by a certain date so that it could go into the report and comments
on the complete minutes could take longer  thats one possibility
chairman bernanke  president pianalto do you have a question
ms pianalto  yes i have a question on the timing of the chairmans
testimony  are those dates set by law
mr reinhart  the law says no later than february 20 and july 20  in practice
the committee sometimes allows for some slippage  the last few times it has tended to be
earlier than that  so that does put a t in terms of your planning horizon  you also have
some flexibility about when you schedule the meetings
chairman bernanke  i understand that the doughnut truck has arrived
laughter  so give us a twentyminute break for coffee and we will continue this
discussion
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene  we had some hurried
consultation during the break about how best to proceed with this discussion  breaking with
our usual practice we decided that it might be best for me to begin and to provide you with
my sense of a broad schematic of how i see us going forward with our communications in
particular with the projections which i view as being central to our plan  i note that people
can justifiably complain that they havent had enough preliminary information for this
discussion which im about to give you  but let me also say first that there will be of
course opportunity to react in the round to follow and second that we will continue to poll
you and to consult with you and that were not going to be finalizing this for some time yet
so in the interest of trying to give you something to react to let me just present an overview
of how i see this going
the extended projections that we have been experimenting with can be a central
critical element of a new and expanded communication strategy that will in fact address
many of the concerns that were raised today  ill be very explicit about that as i go through
this  in particular what are the elements of these expanded projections   first i
recommend that we extend the projection horizon  we have used a third year in our
experiment so far  i think that might be the right solution but let me just leave open for
discussion the possibility of either using a fourth year or replacing the third year with a third
through fifth year average or something of that sortsort of a longterm average  second i
recommend that we release this projection quarterly  that would mean approximately
quarterly because the calendar is not conducive to an exact quarterly release schedule  that
would mean that two of the projections would appear in the context of the monetary policy
report  this is not a central concern but my thought at this point would be that we should
revisit the monetary policy report and try to make it more informative  there is a lot that
we could do to make it betterto include more information include boxes and essentially
make it a moreeffective publication  that would be as now twice a year  perhaps on the
off quarters we could have a small release of some sort or we could include the projections
in the minutes  thats one of the issues that we need to discuss as we go forward
third i think that in our projections we ought to project a total inflation measure
as many people have noted there is confusionand even some resentment i would say
about what appears to be our excessive attention to core inflation  projecting a total inflation
measure throughout the projection would first of all clarify that our definition of price
stability is in terms of total inflation and would give us opportunities to explain in this
document in speeches and elsewhere not only why we do look at core inflation how we
use core inflation and its role as a forecasting mechanism but alsoas president fisher and
others have mentionedthat its not a necessarily sufficient statistic and that we should look
at other things as we try to forecast overall inflation
i would go even further herejust again to be concrete  ive wavered myself on
thinking about which particular measure  ive had discussions with the staff and i am not
wedded to anything in particular at this point but currently i am leaning toward suggesting
that we use the pce deflator as our measure of inflation  its a technically better measure
it uses chain weighting and has a lower weight on shelter costs which have their obvious
problems  it has disadvantages  there is a significant nonmarket component for example
an argument can be made for the cpi on the grounds that it is better known although as has
been pointed out to me if we begin to really focus on the pce it may endogenously
become better known  another point to make here isand i dont want to get too distracted
with thisthat since there is a fairly stable wedge between the pce and the cpi we might
be able to use the cpi in some of our communication as long as were clear that we are not
picking and choosing as far as our objective and our definition of price stability are
concerned
another component of the projections that we have been doing which i think is very
valuable is adding a considerable amount of both qualitative and quantitative information to
our projection  that includes in particular our explanation of the qualitative material that
we have been submittingdescribing the forecast the risk to the forecast the sense of
uncertainty that we have and so onand i think that will be very valuable  as i said we
can combine this with other supporting information  there are various ways to do this
there could be a separate document four times a year  it could be in the minutes  i
suggested one possibility which is to include it in the monetary policy report twice a year
and keep it in the minutes or as a separate document on the off quarters
let me talk a bit about what this would accomplish for us and then i will summarize
that at the end  first of all the public is very hungry for information about the federal
reserves outlook and our sense of the risks to the economy  we have as i have noted
before the best forecasting group in the world  we have useful information to add to the
debate  by providing that information i think we can help people make better decisions and
understand policy and the economy better  in particular the more we are forced to explain
our predictions and our forecasts the more credible well be and well be inviting
discussion reaction and debate that will i think make our projections better  one of the
advantages of transparency is that we begin to interact more with the outside world
second i think we should assume optimal monetary policy  i had some other ideas
before but in the end i think thats the right thing to do  an important implication of
assuming optimal monetary policy is that the projections therefore become essentially as
everyone understands a plan for how we propose to steer the economy if you will
subject of course to all the qualifications of uncertainty forecast problems and so on  it
gives an explicit road map with reference to both sides of our mandate about how we expect
our policies to move the economy toward our objectives over the next three years  i think
thats very important for a number of reasons such as accountability and transparency  but
let me give you an example of where i think its particularly useful
one issue we have been discussing is the appropriate period for achieving price
stability and two suggestions are out there  one is sort of the standard bank of england
approach which says that we have a twoyear horizon  we have certain concerns about
that  in particular it doesnt necessarily take into account at least not explicitly the state of
the real economy the initial conditions how far we are from price stability and so on
another possibility is to say well its just an aspirational number  its a longterm number
we dont have any particular schedule for getting there  people have raised the obvious
objection  wheres the discipline  wheres the credibility associated with that  so as we
understand this we can explain to the public that the projections go a long way toward
solving this problem because they show how far out we think we have to go to get to what
we and the public view as being reasonable levels of price stability  so it does in a very
important way solve the problem of the appropriate horizon
now i should add a point that will come up which is that one could object that the
projections are not the same as a committee forecast  we are not going to come together
and make a single forecast that the entire committee buys into except to the extent that we
do have consensus building which we will have over time in our meetings  that aspect of it
could be viewed as a lack of clarity  however the aggregation process does reflect unique
features of the federal reserve including its institutional structure the large size of
committee the geographical dispersion of its membership and our longstanding
willingness to accept and encourage diverse views within the committee  so we wont be
forcing some kind of artificial consensus  there will be opportunity for disparity  in
particular i would recommend that we provide information to the public about the cross
sectional distribution as we already do  but my inclinationand people can reactwould
be to provide the entire crosssectional distribution to convey the sense of uncertainty or the
sense of dispersion of views and that will be informative in the same way that the votes in
the boes monetary policy committee are informative  however as in the case of the
bank of england and other banks even though we wont be having a common forecast
neverthelessas i think we have already seen the preparation of our individual forecasts
does create a certain amount of discipline and has been useful for us in thinking about our
forecast
a very important question is what is conveyed by the thirdyear projections and i
think that they are at the heart of the innovation created by this step  assuming that were
not too far from the steady state initially which i think characterizes our current situation it
is evident that the thirdyear projectionsor alternatively the third through fifth or
however we decide to do itreveal a lot of information about our views on sustainable
longrun growth our views on sustainable unemployment and of course our views of what
price stability is  i simply take note of the fact that the latest projections show the central
tendency of the committees inflation objectives to be 15 to 2 percent on the core pce
deflator  i actuallyand im speaking entirely for myselfwould be not at all displeased if
that became known as the federal reserves comfort zone or informal definition of price
stability  first its a compromise among different views  second i realize that im
complicit in the 1 to 2 percent comfort zone but i do note that the lowest twelvemonth core
pce in 2003 was 127  i dont think wed be comfortable with inflation rates below 1
percent even though were obviously willing to tolerate inflation rates slightly above 2  its
not symmetrical and i think that the comfort zone revealed by our thirdyear forecast would
be reasonable and would provide useful information
some would be concerned that were also providing information about the
committees views on sustainable growth and sustainable unemployment  i am not that
concerned about it  i think that a transparent committee should do that  however for those
who are concerned about possible risks ill point out that committee projections will have a
lot of dispersion that probably will essentially encompass most reasonable estimates of these
variables  moreover there will be forecast errors around those projections and as we get
information about productivity and other factors we will be able to update those estimates
i dont think that they will be a major constraint  i think that they will in fact just provide
some information to the public
i note that some participants have talked about an opportunistic approach to
disinflation which still seems to have some adherents around the tablethat is people who
may say well im sort of for 2 percent now but i can see over time if the opportunity
arises very gradually moving down to 1 and so forth  obviously the revealed preference
shown by the thirdyear projection doesnt distinguish between those things  one thing that
might happenand i dont think its necessarily a bad thingis that if opportunistic
disinflation happens and those individuals therefore lower their projections the committees
projection might drift down a bit  i dont think it would drift up  i think there would be a
strong resistance to that  but it would be responding appropriately to changing conditions
and i dont think it would change very much so the fact that it would not be literally rigid is
not necessarily a problem to me
some thought will have to be given to vocabulary how we describe these things  i
think that i will myself want to talk about the committees projections  its not quite right
to call them a target because we will not have agreed universally and chosen a number once
and for all  that being said i think that the normative implications of the number will not
be missed by the public and that it will do a lot to clarify peoples views on what the
committee is trying to do and will also be useful for internal discussions  in particular in
testimony speeches and the like i would use the projections as my reference point as i talk
about what the committee is trying to do where we are heading and what we think is the
best way to get there
so let me summarize what i think this component of our communication strategy
could do for us noting that some other things could come in the packageperhaps faster
minutes changes in the statements and so on  but let me just talk about what i think is best
for us  first it is going to allow us to provide considerably more information to the public
and in a more timely way because it will be quarterly  second it will give us an opportunity
to clarify how quickly we intend to move toward our objectives  it will give us a way to
deal with the problem of the horizon  those of you who were at the st louis feds
conference on inflation targeting in 2003 might remember a paper by board staff members
jon faust and dale henderson in which they talked about inflation targeting as being
focused on the mean of the objective but needing also to focus on the variance  what they
mean by that is the speed with which misses are fixed and that some regimes are not
adequately constructed to deal with that  again this would allow us to be very explicit and
very accountable about how we return to our objectives
third it would allow us again to move to total inflation as our objective and to
clarify how we use core inflation as an input into forecasting total inflation  fourth it would
clear up the current confusion about comfort zones and individual views  were not going
to take a vote on the particular number but i think a reasonable way to proceed is to
consider the range of thirdyear projections as being a kind of consensus view of what most
of us think is an appropriate measure of price stability  again i think the normative
implications will be clear  fifth it will improve our internal discussion and decisionmaking
were already seeing that  in fact it has highlighted some problems that we have in our
communications and in our coherence  this will help i think  sixth it respects the feds
unique institutional structure the nature of its committee its governance procedures and its
attention to diversity of views  moreover it builds explicitly on a communication device
that weve been using for thirty years  in that respect it will look in some sense as
incremental even though i think its very substantive  but i think with its incremental
nature the transition risksbe they market risks political risks and so onwill be more
moderate than they would otherwise possibly be
so this is an outline  i know that some of you may think that this is a bridge too far
some of you will think that ive only started on the road to damascus here  laughter  as i
said there will be an opportunity now to go around as you talk to give any reaction you
might have to this  also i have not been very specific about the questions raised in
exhibit 1 that vince put out  these things bear on the details but im pretty flexible about
them  i think id like to see the minutes moved up if possible consistent with doing all of
what ive described  otherwise im pretty flexible about this
let me just say a few other things about going forward  this together with the other
elements is part of an ongoing process  were not going to lock this down  i will ask the
subcommittee to continue in existence  certainly were going to have to move forward if
we all agree that this is the direction that we want to go to implement the details of the
minutes the monetary policy report the collection of this information and so forth
i would like to talk about the whole package whatever we come to in the fallthat
is in the next three or four months  i will surprise don by saying this  it would be very nice
if i could have something to point to in october but its certainly possible and i think its
very important for us to move deliberately  if thats not possible to do in a safe and clean
way then we could wait until january to actually deliver some product  so that is a
question  i think that what will happen is that we will see the reaction we get  we will see
how the public and the markets respond  we may have to take further steps  when we see
how this goes the markets and the public will tell us what they need to know that were not
yet telling them and then we can move it still further if we need to  but my sense is that
with some of the details that we need to work outand your comments are more than
welcome as they are with the entire visionas a central part of a package this would move
us in a good direction  so im going to stop there and well have a goround  did you have
an intervention
mr hoenig  i have just a question  in communicating the projections what are
you suggesting there mr chairman  is it four times a year that we would put the
projections out with commentary
chairman bernanke  yes
mr hoenig  okay  fine  thank you
chairman bernanke  let me give governor kohn a chance to lead off as the
chairman of the subcommittee and then well have a full goround  don
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i agree with and strongly support the path
that youve outlined for us for the reasons youve articulated so nicely  let me add a few
things and then give a few specifics  i think this would be a very important contribution to
enhancing the understanding of the public the markets and the legislators about what were
doing and why  just to emphasize something that you just mentioned mr chairman this
systematic approach to thinking about the risks and the symmetries and the asymmetries
around the risks will be very useful in our communication with the public and a systematic
and regular approach to talking about the changes in the forecast will be very useful to
explaining to the public how our forecast is evolving  from my perspective these
explanations are among the most important things that we can do  the writeup that
president hoenig was asking about is key here  to my mind the forecast is really a
framework for putting all of our explanation our writeup in place and is a disciplining
process for explaining our thoughts about how and why the economy is evolving  i think
its more those explanations than the specific numbers that we use to educate the public
about what were thinking how we think things are developing and looking at the risks and
the uncertainties how were likely to react to incoming information  this would put that
endeavor on a much more systematic track than it has been in the past when it has relied
from time to time on ad hoc speeches by the chairman or on mentions of it in the
announcements minutes or whatnot  so i think this will be very good
i agree with you that the thirdyear forecasts are mostly peoples preferences for the
long run  i admit to being that opportunistic disinflator to whom you were referring  maybe
there are others around the table  i dont know  i wrote down 19 for year three and i might
prefer something a little lower over time  but given the starting place i thought the welfare
benefits of going down to 18 or 17 or even 16 or 15 were less than the welfare costs of the
potential unemployment that we would incur doing that  im also somewhat skeptical about
the credibility bonuses from making announcements  but obviously i wouldnt have
written down a number that wasnt very heavily influenced by my objective over time  so
the public will be correct in interpreting those thirdyear numbers as pretty much where the
individual members of our committee want to go even if its not exactly the right number  i
note that the 15 to 2 thats in our forecast is not that wide a range  its narrower than the
inflation targets of some countries like new zealand and australia  so it wont contribute
that much to uncertainty  i also note that in mike leahys charts yesterday the inflation
compensation changes in the united states over the past couple of months were about the
same as in the inflationtargeting countries  i dont think theres a huge amount of
uncertainty about what were doing  now some people might think that the inflation
expectations are tied at too high a leveli think that president plosser pointed that out  but
i dont think that the public is afflicted with a whole lot of uncertainty about what our
objectives are relative to some other inflationtargeting countries
i see this as sort of a riskmanagement approach to talking about our longrun
inflation objective  we get this out there see what the reactions are see what kinds of
questions there are and then proceed  if it looks as though the right thing to do is to actually
vote in the committee about what our longrun objective is we can do that then  but we
havent gone that extra step which we will never be able to take back again if theres some
sort of reaction that we havent anticipated  the federal reserve is in a very different place
relative to our democratically elected representatives than a lot of other central banks  we
report to the congress  we dont have a minister of finance or a chancellor of the
exchequer that intercedes between us and the congress  the congress has given us goals in
words and not in numbers fortunately  i wouldnt want them to give us goals in numbers
there were some numbers in the humphreyhawkins act which on the unemployment rate
were potentially quite damaging if we had gone for them  they havent asked us to put
numbers on these goals  they havent looked at this for ten years but in the mid90s when
the senate looked at this they didnt go anywhere with it  they rejected it  so i think we
are out in front by doing this  if there were to be a backlash against even this limited step
then at least we wouldnt have committed to something that might provoke a bigger
backlash  so i see this as a step toward possibly specifying price stability numerically a
step that helps to manage the risk that it might provoke some reactions that we would have
trouble living with  so im very strongly in support of the path you outline
i think the subcommittee needs from the rest of the committee some answers even
before we get to the specifics here  so do you agree that we ought to proceed with an
enhanced projections process like the one weve been going through the past two times
we might have some specifics  should we do it four times a year  i think we should but
not everybody might  are we doing approximately the right variables noting that well
have to adjust our price variables  i agree with you mr chairman that adding total
inflation to the core is a very good idea and we ought to use the same index for both of
those whatever it might happen to be  so well do some adjusting
do you agree that there ought to be a writeup of these projections more or less like
the one that the staff has produced approved by the fomc so that it is an fomc document
and released to the public  now we might discuss exactly whats in that document  like
you mr chairman i kind of like the histograms of how many people were lined up at the
particular answers to give a sense of the dispersion of views on the committee they are
much easier for me to look at than the central tendencies and the broad range things but not
everybody might agree  so i think there are some questions even before we get to are you
satisfied with the general thrust of where were going  i think thats what we really really
need to know more than other things
let me address some of the things in exhibit 1  i like the sharing of forecast
submissions anonymously  i guess im concerned that if it was by name it would
potentially be harder to change your mind at the meeting  it would put pressure on those
submitting to have moreelaborate submissions  my sense was that i got the information
that was important to me about where people generally were  i thought the way we
provided information on the federal funds rate path was useful as well  we need to
recognize that as we go forward with thisi hope we go forward with thisthere will be
public pressure on us to release the underlying federal funds rate path  i think we need to go
into this with our eyes open  that pressure will be there but we need to resist that pressure
the process that we used last time worked pretty well  but lets be aware that there are risks
associated with releasing what we think is the path of the federal funds rate going forward
some central banks are doing that now small central banks or small countries in the north
and the south in the antipodes and up in scandinavia  let them experiment with this for a
while and see how the market reacts and how that interfaces with their own decisionmaking
processes before we go down that path
i also like the change in characterizing uncertainty in the risks around the forecast
that is heres a table  include that table  how do you feel relative to that table  i think the
table will help the public understand how little we know about the macroeconomy
laughter  one thing that concerns me about the projections process and delivering these
things is the decimal pointto the right of the decimal point  theres a bit of a risk that we
would be perceived as knowing that theres some difference between 17 and 18 percent
inflationthat we can really determine itand i think that including the table will tell
people thats not really the case  so i think it is important that the table be in there
regarding in what form the projections should be released your thought for two
times in an enhanced monetary policy reportin february and julyand two other
timeseither in the minutes or in a separate document released around or just before the
minutes but really just being that enhanced writeupstrikes me as right  so two updates
that are very compressed and not much more than what we agree on and then the two
monetary policy reports in which they would be embedded strike me as the right way to
go
in terms of finalizing the projections as i think vincent noted im of the view that
we shouldnt be updating our projections except from what we hear at this meeting  the
projections we release are how we explain what we did why we did it and when we sat
around this table how we saw the path forward that influenced our decision  as for
information that comes in after we leave this table we will not have had an opportunity to
digest it or to discuss it and its implications among ourselves  so yes if we want to update
our projections after the meeting i would have a very narrow window and the update
would be based on the information you heard at the meeting
in terms of the minutes as indicated by my question to vince as a general principle
id like to shorten the time before they come out  president poole i cant speak to a specific
advantage of dodging one piece of data or another but the minutes are a very good nuanced
view of what we discussed and why we made the decision  i found it always very helpful to
have them out there when i give a speech or answer questions particularly when i answer
questions from the audience and i cant control what im saying  laughter  right
freudian slip  lets see  well clean that one up in the transcript  laughter  i think the
sooner we get the minutes out there the more helpful they will be for the public and for all of
us who are out in the public but we cant put so much pressure on this process that we dont
have an appropriate review  the words will be even more important particularly four times
a year  im not quite sure how all of this fits together with your testimony and all that but if
we can i think we ought to shorten the time  i think the minutes have approximately the
right level of detail in them now  some central banks give much more detail about what one
view was and another view was and what one person said and another person said but with
nineteen people sitting around the table that would be impossible  so i think were there
also i like the idea that president poole suggested a couple of years ago and i think vincent
did as well of taking that stuff about the past the first eight pages or so through the staff
forecast and making that a staff document  so we could say as background for the
meeting the staff prepared or supplied the committee with the following information
however they want to do itif they want to make it part greenbook or whatever it is their
thing  at the least that takes it out of our hands  it helps us with the editing process  it
helps them with the editing process  so i think that would be a helpful innovation  thank
you  i am sorry to have gone on so long
chairman bernanke  thats okay  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  we were asked to comment on a long
list of questions concerning economic projections the minutes and the statement  in
addition governor kohn has put out the broader question of the general thrust of the
direction were going in and id like to focus my remarks on the latter  frankly right now i
think the most important question regarding the release of our projections concerns the
relationship of these communication devices to our inflation objective  everything else is
more or less small potatoes right now  i believe it would be a mistake to release our
projections without agreeing on it and communicating a committee inflation objective  its
inevitable in fact its intended the way you described it mr chairman that participants
thirdyear inflation projections will be interpreted as the equivalent of an objective  i think
this would be problematic without an explicit statement of an objective for a number of
reasons
first our projections display a nontrivial dispersion admittedly a narrow range but
market participants are going to have a keen interest in whether we believe a 19 percent
inflation rate say is too high or just about right  financial market participants already
believe that theres a dispersion of the committee members preferred inflation rate and that
it lies between 1 and 2 percent  i note that showing that every individual preferred
inflation rate spans a range of 1 to 2 percent is not equivalent to the committees deciding
that its collective preferred inflation rate is for anything within a band of 1 to 2 percent
so i dont think this is going to enhance the clarity of the publics understanding of our
intentions much at all
second communicating our inflation objective via threeyearout projections would
accomplish little by way of enhancing any commitment since wed release the projections
anew three or four times a year with the implication that our implied objective could change
over time  ill remind you again about my brotherinlaw doing retirement benefit
projections just to make the important point that a significant part of the value of an
announced objective is to reduce longrun uncertainty about inflation
third our inflation projections would be displayed alongside exactly analogous
projections for unemployment and gdp growth in an exactly analogous way  this would
confuse people about the economics of monetary policy  in that context how do we convey
that we do not have numerical targets for unemployment or growth  how do we convey
that inflation is a variable that we control in the medium and long run but we cannot peg
growth or unemployment at any one number in a sustained way  in other words how do
we remind people that the longrun phillips curve is virtually vertical  a related
consideration is that if we present our projections this way and do not clearly state our
inflation objectives its not hard to imagine someone in the congress trying to hold us as
accountable for our unemployment projection as for our inflation projections  this would
be a dramatic step backward for us i think
fourth and probably the most pressing and immediate problem in my view
publishing our projections this way will do nothing to improve the clarity of our internal
deliberations or to alleviate the problems we have and will continue to have in writing
statements in the absence of an agreedupon objective
for these reasons i believe that the release of economic projections containing
participants forecasts for inflation three years out would be a poor and ineffective substitute
for an explicitly articulated objective and would be problematic without such an objective
now let me be clear  i do think we should move ahead in this direction and i applaud your
leadership mr chairman for putting something on the table today at the outset of the
discussion  i just think we should do this in conjunction with the inevitable other step of
agreeing on what were about here in the committee  i can appreciate the sensitivity to the
likelihood that various politicians may react to our communication of an explicit numerical
objective but over the past thirty years politicians have reacted to many of our actions that
were integral to our successes over that period  we should decide honestly what we believe
is best for the country and communicate it clearly and with confidence  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may i
chairman bernanke  im sorry  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  so president lacker is it your view that if were
not at this point prepared to announce a quantitative definition of the committees longterm
objective that we should not do a thirdyear projection
mr lacker  yes
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i very much support the proposal that
youve outlined here  i think it does not tie our hands as individuals which was one of my
concerns originally  it allows us to do our work as members of this committee and to put
our information out there for our colleagues and for the public to judge and i think thats
very important as individuals on the committee  i think that the thirdyear projections are
helpful  they do take on the tone of a goal  theres no question about that but i dont think
that its necessarily bad at all for us as individuals and i dont necessarily think the fact that
we have differences is bad for us as a committee so long as were clear about our analysis
for that  so im very supportive of that
i would move the minutes up if at all possible  i think they have served us well  we
still work very hard on the statement but the minutes have deemphasized the importance of
the statement because they clarify and the sooner you can clarify through the minutes the
better the public is served  so yes we should proceed  i like four times a year  now how
do we do it in terms of the description and so forth  thats something i think well
experiment with over time  i really do like the histograms  i think they give a very clear
piece of information to the public and to each of us  so im very supportive of them as well
the variables you have are just about right  i prefer the cpi as i have in the past but i
certainly wouldnt fall on my sword about it  i think getting this out is more important than
whether we do the cpi or the pce  i do think total inflation is very importantit helps
clarify things for the public and allows us to explain the difference between it and core  if i
had my choice id stay away from the fed funds rate path  appropriate policy or the way
you have described it is fine  using uncertainty in explaining it is extremely important
because it is an uncertain business over time
i would not have revisions they distort what we had coming in  the minutes should
describe parts of the discussion and clarify things for us as we go through it  so redoing the
projections afterward serves no real useful purpose to my mind  i think we should move
forward on this as youve described it here  i like your summary of what doing it
accomplishes  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i too want to thank you for putting
this proposal on the table  i think it will help this discussion and i find myself agreeing with
everything you recommended actually  im a little frustrated  i cant find anything to
disagree with  laughter  but let me mention a few nuances  on the question of whether it
is helpful to do this in the absence of a quantitative inflation objective i think that on
balance it is  it does move the ball forward  in line with bill pooles question earlier its an
incremental step but a very significant incremental step forward and one that on balance
will help provide more information  if at some point in the future the committee decides to
have a quantitative objective it would be an important part of that process  in any case
youd have to do it as well
on the questions that don kohn asked us to comment on specifically i think that
yes we should proceed with the enhanced projections and four times a year is a good way to
do it  i like the total inflation approach looking at it on a longterm basis because it
clarifies the confusion between core and total and over time they should clearly be the
same  regarding the writeup my recommendation is to put it as an appendix to the
minutes to keep it as simple as possible  i think that putting it as an appendix simplifies it
because then you can just lift it out and use it those two times a year for the monetary policy
report and it just eliminates any possibility of confusion between the two  if the timing of
your testimony before the congress is such that you need an expedited process for that
appendix its easier to do it that way  it just simplifies it for everyone and theres just less
risk of confusion  i think it would be easier for the staff as well
i like the idea of the three to five years by the way for the longer term  that is
helpful in terms of explaining this to the public  i know some people are concerned that it
raises questions about what potential output is and so on but youre giving a range and i
think it helps just to explain the complexity of this  having the longerterm period would be
helpful as well
getting back to vinces specific questions hereshould we share them  yes  i like
the way youve used the fed funds rate path and i like the uncertainty and risk  about
finalizing projections i agree completely with what don said  the information should be
what we have in hand at the time of the meeting because we all should have the same cutoff
point for the projection and thats the logical cutoff point and then maybe give people a day
or two to update them or modify them based on what they heard at the meeting  but it
should be a very clear cutoffthe day of the meeting
about expediting the minutes i guess i would have one disagreement here  i
disagree with don on this  the benefits of expediting them would be very minor compared
with the potential costs in terms of additional staff resources that would be needed  i think
we have it just about right now  again if you shorten the schedule you cant lengthen it
again  so i would just keep it where it is now
i just mention one other little aspect and that relates to the histograms  i agree we
should use themthey will show the outliers in the projection which is fine  again using
them shows the diversity of views  there is a risk here that some of the outliers may over
time want to move more to the center but so be it  i dont think that is a great risk but i
think it is something we should recognize might occur here  so on balance i think the
proposal you have put forth is very very good and i agree completely with it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i like president moskow find it very
difficult to find any disagreement with what you propose  im very supportive of the
approach youve laid out for the reasons that you articulated so clearly  i support extending
the forecast period  you mentioned going to a third year you also suggested maybe a three
tofiveyear average  im leaning toward the threetofiveyear average because i had
proposed a fiveyear extension of the forecast periodthe two years that we currently use
and then adding the fifth year  but your threetofiveyear average makes perfect sense to
me
im very supportive of using a total inflation number  president hoenig mentioned
that he had a preference for the total cpi and so do i for the reasons that you mentioned  its
a measure that the public currently understands and it gets a lot of publicity  but as you
point out if we start using the pce deflator the public will start to focus on that measure  i
like the approach of having quarterly releases of our projections  that seems appropriate
last year we saw that when we release our forecasts only twice a year they can become
outdated rather quickly  so giving more information on a quarterly basis would allow us to
keep our forecasts more current  i would like us to spend more time talking about whether
we assume an optimal policy because as governor kohn pointed out were going to get
pressure to release our fed funds rate path because people are going to want more
clarification of what we mean by appropriate monetary policy or optimal monetary
policy  finally i like the fact that your approach retains the current structure of the federal
reserve system and allows us to give our own forecasts letting the public see the diversity
of opinion around that forecast  we are going to have to discuss when it will be appropriate
for us to talk about our individual forecasts because once we start to give the public more
information about the committees views on certain things the public will want to find out
where the differences are  then we will have to have some agreement about whether its
appropriate to talk individually about how we see our differences from the committee  but
these are details that we can talk about with more time  in general im very supportive of
the approach that youve laid out today
i know weve been asked to answer some of vincents questions and respond to
some proposals that governor kohn put out and ill just make a few comments  i do want
to proceed with the projection  i mentioned that quarterly would be fine  regarding when
the projections should be finalized i support doing it at the end of the week and using the
same rules that we use for the minutes currentlynot to bring in new data that we receive
in terms of the benefits and costs of further expediting the minutes i think like president
moskow that the benefits are minor compared with some of the costs  the current process
is giving more time for members to give thoughtful input into those minutes and i wouldnt
want to change that  those items complete my comments  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  as some others have said i want to
applaud your leadership in laying out a proposal for how we think about this  its important
to have a framework on the table for thinking about where we want to be  i would add that
generally i agree with almost everything you said  i think its a good way forward  i view
this as a step not the end game  its part of a process in which we evaluate what were
doing and how we do it  while i share in principle president lackers concern about the
potential risks associated with doing this without agreeing on explicit objectives im willing
to bear those risks because since most people around this table know where id like to be in
terms of that i think the risks are acceptable in the short run as a means of getting us to that
ultimate objective  i think that this will help us as a committee become more comfortable
with being more transparent and more communicative and that the process in itself will help
us get to where i think we ought to be  so from that standpoint im very supportive of this
direction  i support going through with it under the guidelines and broad outline that you
described
as to some of the specific things that governor kohn mentioned and we talked
about as i said i want to proceed  i think four times a year is right  the details of the
monetary policy report to the congress are just a detail  we can work them out
somebody is better at figuring that out than i am  i think that shouldnt be considered a
stumbling block  i support moving to total inflation  as i said both yesterday and earlier
today i think thats important  im marginally indifferent between total pce and total cpi
earlier i had advocated the cpi  im still perhaps at the margin but to me thats not a big
issue one way or the other  i agree on the timingthe forecast and the projections ought to
be based on information available at the meeting not subsequent information  in fact thats
very important in what were trying to communicate about our decisionmaking process  im
fairly happy with the way the staff has crafted the language  i think they have done a pretty
good job of capturing the sense  im rather indifferent about whether we incorporate it into
the minutes directly or we make it an addendum  again i think the markets and this group
can live with it either way and people who read the minutes will come to understand and
accept it one way or another
the two points with which i have some trouble or perhaps a little disagreement with
governor kohns comments concern the optimal policy and whether we reveal whats
implicit in the fed funds rate forecast going forward  i think that revealing a dispersion or
the varying underlying policy assumptions that people are using going forward helps on the
issue of uncertaintythat the world is uncertain and that our understanding of the way the
macroeconomy works is uncertain  by revealing that some underlying sets of assumptions
that we on the committee are making to get to this set of objectives are different could
actually be very helpful in reinforcing the view that the future is uncertain  therefore rather
than locking us into some path it may end up in fact opening up options to us in a way that
we might not have had before  so i think theres actually potential information there that
were providing to the marketplace that may be valuable  giving this area a bit more
thought might be worthwhile
the second point is one that president pianalto just mentioned and it just occurred
to me after she mentioned it  i realized that if we submit these forecasts anonymously and
if theyre reported anonymously even though the dispersions and so forth are reported in the
minutes we as presidents and as board members are out giving speeches all the time about
our outlook for the economy  at the end of the day we are unlikely to stop giving out
information about what our views are  its a little like hiding it over here but everybody is
out talking about what their view is anyway  so im not sure we are buying anything real by
being anonymous about our forecasts  i guess im in favor of revealing more rather than
lessrevealing more about our uncertainties or our assumptions underlying the future path
of the fed funds rate and having that information convey some uncertaintyand being more
transparent because we are anyway about what our individual forecasts may have been in
talking about that outlook  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  may i ask a clarifying question before i speak
chairman bernanke  sure
vice chairman geithner  this really goes to the remarks of president
moskow and to the relationship between a narrative to accompany the projections and the
description in the minutes  if you did that model which as i understood it president
moskow is to incorporate a narrative as an appendix to the minutes how then would the
description of the outlook that is in the minutes nowthe narrative description of the
central tendency of the committee that now goes in the minutesrelate to the narrative
description about the projections  what would be the relationship be between those two
things if you did them as separate but linked documents
mr moskow  obviously the two would have to be drafted very carefully to
make sure that they are in concert and that there are no inconsistencies in them  but i
think doing so is clearly manageable because one is a set of longerterm projections and
the other is a discussion of the shorterterm outlook
vice chairman geithner  so that is the distinction  you would say the
minutes are the description of the nearterm outlook that underpins our judgment about
the decision at the meeting and the annex would be more of a focus on the description of
the medium term
mr moskow  yes whatever the timeframe is for the projections
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  isnt there a third alternative  the minutes are what we actually
discussed and the other thing is a story  i think president moskows question really
relates to whether or not we are going to try to weave what we actually discussed into
some coherent story or try to make the minutes really be what i suspect they were
originally intended to be which is what the color and commentary of our discussion
were
chairman bernanke  i think i would just note vice chairman geithner
that jim clouse wrote a version of the minutes that did a pretty good job of integrating
them  it gave the projections with the longterm overview and the underlying forces et
cetera and then the rest of the minutes as is our wont in sort of a sectorbysector
discussion of mostly developments in the near term  but you raise a good question  i
think we should keep that in mind
mr fisher  mr chairman may i askwas that the draft that ms danker sent
around
mr reinhart  yes the appendix to debbie dankers memo is the draft that
jim clouse prepared  i think the vice chairman is correct in that of course there would
be some repetition in the discussion of the minutes just because the sectorbysector
discussion of the nearterm conjuncture is going to be somewhat similar to the longer
term structure of the threeyear or the threetofiveyear forecast  but they would serve
different purposes and that repetition might not be unhelpful
vice chairman geithner  okay  so mr chairman i am very supportive
of the path you laid out  i think it basically is the optimal balance today between what
the consensus of the committee will bear now on the merits and what our unique
institutional structure as a central bank permits  now your view and the committees
view of that balance may change over time but i think what you described has to be
pretty close to the optimal balance of those needs today  what is the objective of this
exercise  i think i am completely comfortable with what you and don said in terms of
the broad objectives of what we are trying to achieve through these enhanced projections
but i think fundamentally that it is important to recognize that we are not principally
trying to give a lot of detail about dispersion and variance within the committee  what
we should try to do mostly is to give more texture around the central tendency view of
the committee about the likely evolution the desirable evolution of the economy over a
twotothreeyear maybe longer period so that people have a better sense of what
informs our basic judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy  we should
make sure that we keep to that objective as we think about what to put into a proposal
regarding enhanced projections
on the specifics i am fine with a third year  i would like to discuss a little further
the merits of three years versus three to five years  i think the tradeoffs between the two
are very interesting and i want to say something about that in a bit  i am fine with
quarterly  i agree that we should have projections on both headline and core and that
they should be based on the same index not different indexes  before we decide to go to
pce and core pce again we should discuss how to think about what it will be like to
live in a world where we still have tips paying the cpi  we still have a whole bunch of
surveybased measures reporting the cpi  if were going to give a lot more emphasis to
the mediumterm implicit objectives of the committee in some quantitative sense like
this we should think through whether it will work or be comfortable over time  i agree
that this should be done on a view of optimal policy that is undisclosed for the reasons
that have been put in favor of that although i think president plosser did a nice job of
explaining the alternative view
i would also be in favor of expediting the minutes on the grounds that i think
there is a lot of virtue in saying that you want to have a short period between what we say
about what we did and why we did it and the greater narrative texture that has to come in
the minutes  the longer the gap between those two things is the greater the risk that you
have two events with signaling impact on monetary policy rather than one  this is
complicated to do and must have some cost but id say that a bias toward collapsing the
two as close as possible is the right bias
on the thirdyear question mr chairman you talked about how you would
describe what people should infer from the thirdyear projection about the objectives and
preferences of the members of the committee individually  my own bias would be to
still try to qualify heavily whatever we say about the meaning of that third year  if we
believe as youve said many times i think that one wants to think about the period for
bringing inflation back down to objective as something that will probably have to vary
based on the circumstances it is really important not to set up a dynamic in which people
view that thirdyear projection as our fixed objective for that horizon  we want to have a
fair amount of flexibility for a view of the appropriate path of inflation over time to
change meeting to meeting and not be too locked into a judgment about that  so i would
say that i am inclined to keep that softer for all the reasons the proponents of a flexible
horizon have laid out
there is virtue in laying out the central tendency of the committees view about
what the appropriate path is likely to be today but there may be circumstances in which
we want to be above target or objective for a longer time than three years  again our
view about that path might actually vary meeting to meeting  so i would want to soften
that up a little  but as we elaborate the package and the drafts of how this gets presented
people will have a chance to look at whether the balance is right
on dispersion and what we say about dispersion across the committee i think the
histograms have a lot of appeal and i have been in favor of them and of disclosing them
in the past  but i am a little worried about the following  there is some risk that they are
demystifying  either the dispersion is going to look too wide or it is going to get kind of
narrow  if we had to decide today i would be inclined to say for this next step that we
should use the narrative description rather than the histogram to characterize dispersion
one reason is that we dont have nineteen people doing independent fully fledged
internally consistent forecasts with a fully elaborated view that is independent of the
greenbooks view of the structure of the economy and its evolution we are not like the
respondents to the survey of professional forecasters in some sense and so to have a
histogram presented of nineteen different views with this degree of diversity and what
goes into that gives probably a bit too much emphasis to the quantitative number of the
individual views with which people come to the table  but they are very appealing as a
device for conveying uncertainty so thats the virtue  i would say maybe start with
trying to put more texture into a narrative description rather than in a histogram
the issue about the relationship between the narrative description that would
accompany the projections and the minutes is something we need to think through more
carefully  im still uncomfortable in that i think what we want to do is to try to give
people a little more sense of the story that defines the central tendency of the committee
about the likely desired evolution of the economyof output and inflation  the part of
the minutes that talks about the outlook shouldnt be too narrow and shouldnt be too
short in its horizon  in many ways we are making a broad judgment about the forecast
horizon at every meeting  i dont know what the solution to this is but i would think
through the relationship a bit more carefully and my inclination is to go for integration
four times a year we do minutes like today and four times a year we do something that
has more texture more detail and a little bit more on the medium term and has some
tables accompanying it  again what we should try to do is give people more of a sense
of the view of the central tendency of the committee that informs that judgment about the
appropriate stance of monetary policy over time  to view them as separate distinguished
things leaves me slightly uncomfortable so i think the topic deserves some more thought
on timing mr chairman in terms of it launching in october versus january i
think we should defer to your basic judgment about what makes sense  my view is that
you should set a dynamic in motion now that gives you the option of doing it in october
if people are comfortable enough by that time and if it looks as though the state of the
world at that point would be conducive to this kind of announcement  but i think that
you want to make sure before we go forward that you have a good sense of how were
going to describe this what its really going to mean and how we handle all the obvious
complicated questions that were going to get
is this enough  will it leave us with an unmanageable set of problems internally
in how we think about decisions on monetary policy or externally in terms of the
ambiguity it still leaves in the market about what our objective is  let me just say a few
things about that  i dont think it is right to say that the market is fixated particularly on
the question about whether our implicit view about what wed like to see inflation do
over time is 15 175 or 2  i think what the market wants really more than anything is
to know what we are going to do with the fed funds rate laughter at the next meeting
the meeting after that and the meeting after that  they would like to know more about
what we think about the economy but really what they want to know is what we are
going to do with monetary policy tomorrow  it is very importantas you read that
people complain about the ambiguity we live with today have lived with for several
decades and are likely to live with in the future about what we are going to do to
inflation over timeto remember that what they want to know is what we are going to do
with the fed funds rate tomorrow  my own sense is we can manage as we have managed
in the past with a framework that leaves the present degree of ambiguity about our
objective unresolved  there is a lot of value and flexibility in that ambiguity  i dont
view it as a particular vice  i dont think that there is any compelling evidence to support
the view that the burden that ambiguity presents today is unmanageablecertainly not
relative to the past two decades  of course we can evolve further  as the chairman
said we should view this as an evolutionary process  we should be prepared to revisit
over time each judgment we make and to continue to explore whether there are things we
can do beyond this to improve the way monetary policy works in the united states  so i
think its not right to think about this as the beginning with a clear evolution for
something beyond this  it is also not right to view this as the end  i think you should
view it as this is what is next and well continue to think through things that might help
us do monetary policy better over time  thats all ive got
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much mr chairman  i too would like to
thank you very much for presenting your thoughts at the beginning of this discussion  it
was extremely helpful to my thinking through what comments i wanted to make at this
meeting  i have also found governor kohn vice chairman geithner and everybody else
who has talked very helpful in thinking through some of these issues
i am very much in favor of the forecast process that we are working on  i dont
think we have it totally right yet but i think were headed in the right direction  its a
great balance because as opposed to establishing right now an inflation objective that
would sit out there for all timemaybe thats the direction in which you want to head in
the futureit characterizes over a longish termand i am attracted more to three years
than to three to five yearshow we see the balance of things working out in the economy
and what we think it is possible to do with our inflation objective over that period given
the other factors that we need to think about in the economy and that are important both
to us and to everybody within our economy  so using these forecasts and putting a third
year out there that describes what the balance of things would be given an appropriate
policy path is something with which i could be very comfortable
i like the way that vice chairman geithner talked about beginnings and ends
one thing that ive been struck by in this whole communication process is how hard it is
to move backward once one starts to do something  it is nearly impossible to take it
away  so as we think about beginnings and ends we need to be very careful about taking
a step at a time  even though it might seem reasonable to take five steps we should try
one see how it works and then move on from there  giving a forecast four times a year
going to three years not three to five and showing the balance of things and the range in
which the committee would see those things turning out would be i would say in
harmony with vice chairman geithner a good step
i agree with four times a yearthats a good frequency  i was kind of drawn to
some of vice chairman geithners thoughts about whether or not to integrate this with
the minutes  i came into the meeting thinking that it would be better as a separate
document appended to the minutes that if the timing worked out well could be put into
the monetary policy report or could stand on its own  i tend to think of the minutes as a
discussion of what happens at the meeting focused on what we used to think of as the
foreseeable future which never was three years  it was always two or three meetings
ahead shaping the stance of policy over the near term  so i was on the same wavelength
as president moskow  the minutes describe a set of circumstances around which one is
shaping current policy  of course they are related to the longer run but that is a story
that can be told somewhat independently and might be told better independently than
woven into the minutes  but i think there is a need to think more about thatvice
chairman geithner had some interesting thoughts
i think anonymity is useful at this timeagain i am thinking that once one takes
a step forward its hard to go back  i like the histograms myself  they are personally
informative  however i think if we accompany at least the first round of these forecasts
with histograms it will be somewhat like throwing red meat at a tiger  we have had
those boring tables in the monetary policy report for thirty years  laughter  you
know the variance in the range the outliersthey have been there the whole time  the
market could have made a lot out of that but it never did not too much anyway  i think
that we might be better off with a more boring approach as a first step into this four times
a yearsay we did it write what it was about give the table but dont give all these red
histograms that seem to beg everybody to worry about the outliers  i dont think that is
going to be helpful to us in terms of discussing things
i know we are probably running short of time and i cant go through all these
questions in the same amount of detail  lets see on that basis i think that we should go
forward four times a year and forecast a threeyear time horizon  i like the idea of total
inflation  every time we have talked about this i thought that if we are going to set a
target it should be in terms of a longish term in total inflation  i would be more inclined
to the cpi  i should mention that i heard your comment that if we focus on pce sooner
or later everybody else will  thats what we thought about ten years ago when we started
talking about pce and over time people havent  pce is there but the cpi still is very
very common in terms of how people talk about inflation and the economy and things
are still linked to the cpi  i do think that we need to give a little more thought to either
the cpi or pce and looking at the total as well as the core is very valuable  i dont think
that we should update our forecasts on anything other than what we heard at the meeting
there havent been many updates in the past  i wouldnt expect there to be that many in
the future so i would think either the same day of the meeting the next day or the
following friday depending on when the day of the meeting is  fine give people time to
update their forecasts based on what they heard at the meeting but not on new data that
are out there
okay  let me see if theres anything else  in terms of the benefits and costs of
further expediting the minutes i agree that there would definitely be costs to doing so
there may however be a benefit in that we might be able to get to the objective that we
initially had of trying to make the statement after the meeting more streamlined  to me
that would be a significant benefit of expediting the minutes  we could focus the
statement on what we did and why we did it and not try to make that a vehicle for some
longerterm reference but rather leave that to the minutes and then four times a year to
the forecast  so i think there is a benefit to expediting the minutes  from a process point
of view people have to be able to get encrypted information on their blackberrys and not
be forced to carry their laptops with them every single place they go  if we expedite the
minutes that will become even more of a burden i think  in a memo vince talked about
delegating approval  i would not do that  the principals have to be the ones to approve
the minutes  if we decide to expedite them we have to facilitate that process so that the
principals can weigh in in a timely way on the minutes  did i miss something that
somebody wants to hear about
mr kohn  the yankees  laughter
ms minehan  probably not  okay  thats it
mr kohn  well ring you up in retirement  laughter
mr mishkin  how about the red sox
ms minehan  my prediction is that they will stay in first place through the
allstar break  laughter  i think thats safe enough
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks  i also want to say that i am very supportive of what
the chairman and the vice chairman said  i really think this threads the needle for
getting as vice chairman geithner said the right balance  we get to provide more
information with greater clarity and greater accountability and i think it will also lead to
greater credibility without being perceived as inflexible or challenging the dual mandate
some of the questions and concerns that i raised in my interventions earlier indicated that
i was supportive of an inflation goal but i said it was a close call  for me this is not a
close call  it really addresses a lot of the potential concerns that i had  i also think its
extremely good in putting us on the proper evolutionary path  as you well know
everything at the fed moves at a pace that is likely to be measured laughter and so this
should operate on that same pace  it allows us to understand how the new numbers will
be perceived  as a number of people said it is very hard to move back but this gives us
some experimentation and a clear movement forward  it allows us to think about
appropriate risk management as the vice chairman said at least at this stage
particularly given that not everyone is on board with a particular number  even if
everyone were on board with a particular number i think a more difficult thing would be
that if you are away from that number what the right path is to get to it  i actually think
that is the most difficult thing to get consensus on  this gives us a little more flexibility
on that without making any particular commitments  it provides some credibility without
raising something that could potentially be more problematic  also it allows us to
harden this if we so choose  if were finding that were not getting the credibility
benefits that we might hope from this we can go forward
on the specifics i think there is consensus on many of the things that have been
said so i wont go through the individual pieces  just let me mention a couple of things
actually along the lines of what the chairman said about focusing on pce and the
endogenous response that there will be more focus on it  i think that is to some extent
correct  i also think that there may be some issues on existing contracts and so it is an
important point to think about
the point that president lacker raised is also an important one to think about
how are these different numbers going to be perceived  obviously we are focusing a lot
on the particular number for inflation but we are putting these other numbers out in the
same format in the same way  this raises questions about growth goals employment
goals the nairu and phillips curve tradeoffs about which we certainlyor at least i
certainlywouldnt feel comfortable in making commitments  that actually leads me to
desire to put out just a thirdyear forecast rather than a threetofiveyear forecast at least
at this point because i think it reduces the chance of misperception and allows for greater
flexibility of how we want to characterize it  it allows us to go forward and characterize
it more as a goal if we so choose and there isnt confusion  but if we say three to five
years it is hard to step away from that being a particular goal  i am not saying that we
dont want to do that down the line  but at this stage i think id feel a bit more
comfortable in sticking with the pace that is likely to be measured and just adding a year
on that
again on this endogenous response if we do this quarterly we are likely to
generate a request for quarterly testimony from the chairman and that response becomes
more and more likely the more independent we make this document  im not saying that
anything is wrong with that but i think we should just be aware of it  the chairman
should be aware of what he is getting himself into laughter and make sure that he feels
comfortable with that although i dont see any problem with it  i just think that it is
important to think about  with respect to the question about whether or not it should be
anonymous i think it is valuable to have the projections out there but to have them be
anonymous  the main reason for anonymity is as you well know that a reporter will
ask dont you think that president x is completely wrong  talk about red meat in
front of a tiger  that is exactly what people like to look for  they like to look for
dissent  although there could be some benefits i see attribution as mostly a downside
trying to generate dissent among people which i think is not particularly productive
i do broadly like the idea of expediting the minutes  getting information to the
market sooner and when it is fresher is more valuable  but i am sensitive to concerns
about the downside risks of people being unable to weigh in and of excess burden on the
staff  so we have to get that balance right  but all other things being equal i prefer
sooner rather than later  making sure that we are available to give feedback or can get
minutes securely in a more expedited process is a relatively small price for the nineteen
of us to pay to provide fresher information to the public  with that i would also say that
we shouldnt revise our projections beyond the day of the meeting because the minutes
should be about the meeting  they shouldnt step on or confuse things and expediting
them makes that kind of revision even more sensible  so i am very much on board with
this type of proposal  thanks
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman you spoke of the road to damascus  i was thinking
about the movie what about bobnot because of my own neuroses about this
exercise but because i think it is important to proceed with baby steps step by step
president minehans point is cardinal  its very hard to go back once you move forward
as i wrote in my memo of june 4 i believe it was i think that you have summarized one
of the most important things that we can do as a committee and that is to get a useful
and credible inflation metric  not only do i applaud the overall outline that you started us
off withand again thank you for bringing that outline to the table because it organized
the conversationbut also i am a big believer in the need for us to come up with an
inflation metric that is credible  tims point on the pce versus the cpi is very important
to consider  as i have said before i am more in favor of the cpi but i do think we need
to think that decision through in terms of the different instruments that are out there in the
market and the precedent that has been set
now i just want to make a couple of points  on the road to damascus we have
to think of what the milestones are going to be  i want to be careful that we dont labor
under a conceit of false precision  i worry sometimes that when we look at these
histogramsand i want to come back to the histograms in a secondthe reality is that
only 20 basis points separate these things  the further we go out in the time horizon
you know the old saying that you only put something three points to the right of the
decimal point to show that you have a sense of humorwe have to be very very careful
not to imply that we have ultra precision  we dont have ultra precision this is a
judgmental business  so that is one point i would like to make
i have very mixed feelings about the histograms  after listening to this
conversation i would suggest that we start with the central tendency analysisthe table
that was put together  the problem with histograms besides giving us a sense of false
precision is something that a couple of the presidents and governors pointed out or
hinted at and governor kroszner just pointed to but i thought that he didnt go far
enough  even if we do it anonymously if we were to publish these the press is going to
poke and poke and pokethe red meat argument that president minehan gaveand ask
who are the outliers and why  once the press starts doing this it is just a matter of
time before a congresswoman or a congressman does the same thing  we row as a crew
as a team and i want to be very careful that we dont take any risk to undermine the
unique aspect of this body  we sit around this table  we have differences of opinion  i
noticed governor kroszner pointed to me when he said this guy is wrong  it was just
the way you were pointing  laughter  i realize that sometimes i am a total outlier here
but that is in the spirit of the comradeship that exists at this table  you put this out for the
public and i think you run certain risks of undermining the authority of this committee
the authority of the chairman and the integrity of the process  the federalist process that
we have is of value  lets be careful that we preserve it and dont make this like every
other washington institution because we are unique in the nature of our integrity
just a couple of other comments  im very wary as i outlined in my letter of
being open about the fed funds rate path we envision  this is our central policymaking
instrument  if we were to forecast it i worry that we are going down a slippery slope
we would be under pressure to validate our forecasts by our actions and i think we need
to preserve some of the mystery that surrounds them  i remind you that ff does stand for
full frontal so i want to be careful again not to give the markets a full frontal view but
to preserve some of our power
with regard to the frequency with which we do this exerciseagain if we do it
baby step by baby step i would like the governors to be mindful of the fact that the
presidents run businesses  we have other things to do  i think vice chairman geithner
pointed to that indirectly  this is not the only thing we do  we dont have our own
models  if governor kohn and the bank affairs committee are willing to give us a few
billion dollars more to build our own models then we are happy to take the money
laughter  but the realism is that we key off the staff and off the frbus model  if you
really look at all these numbers that were given out not a whole lot of variation is there
we need to acknowledge the fact that we dont have the wherewithal and that a lot of this
is guesswork  the further we go out the more it is guesswork
one last point  i like your suggestion mr chairman of the three to five years
as i have made clear i have the opposite fear of president lackers  i think that what
president lacker suggests puts us right into an argument with the political authorities
about what our employment target is  this is a nice way to skirt the issue of formal
inflation targeting and in my view inevitably being forced by the congress into
employment targeting  i support your suggestion that we use a threetofiveyear range
it is a nice elegant way to get us out of a possible box  yet if we decide to go down that
road in the futureagain in this what about bob babystep approachwe can do
that later  i wouldnt start out there  i think there are too many risks  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  clearly from the discussion so far
and my prediction is that it will continue this waythere is a tremendous amount of
support for the outline that you have presented and i share that  i want to focus on two
points that richard raised and maybe hit them a little harder  first on the fed funds path
the fed funds rate is the policy instrument  we dont want to confuse the public about the
difference between the policy instrument and the policy goals  if we want to present
something we ought to present the policy rule by which the fed funds rate is determined
we dont know how to do that beyond the broad outlines of the taylor rule and that is
the point that we should be emphasizing  so i am very opposed to presenting a fed funds
rate path because i think it is really going to confuse our communication
now on the issue of false precision i want to use an analogy because i hope that
it will help to explain this issue  let me use a gps analogy  if i did my calculation
correctly gps coordinates usually show up on your instrument down to a thousandth of a
minute of longitude lets say  if i did my calculation correctly thats about six feet  for
some policy purposes perhaps locating the piers on a suspension bridge you would
really like another digit  but the gps instrument cant produce that other digit  if you
were to try to do it with repeated trials you would just get random garbage therefore if
you are locating bridge piers you have to use a different measuring device  now don
said what is the difference between 19 and 18  well that is beyond the
measurement accuracy of a lot of the data  it is not just that it doesnt have very much
policy relevance but it is really beyond the measurement accuracy and we have multiple
measures of inflation  we take the pce index and we look at it with and without the
nonmarket components  those relationships change and therefore we are really making
a mistake if we force ourselves to make these judgments to 01 percentage point  in the
projections we ought to round these things off to the appropriate number of significant
digits  standard scientific practice is not to present measurements that run beyond the
accuracy of the measuring instruments  so what is the appropriate number of significant
digits in this business  if you look at the nature of the revisions the multiple measures
and so forth i would propose that for gdp and inflation it is probably 05 percentage
point  for the unemployment rate it is maybe 025 percentage point  but we are really
going to tie ourselves in knots over stuff that is like the fourth digit on your gps
instrument  it just doesnt have any measurement validity to it
part of the problem in presenting the histograms that are organized around these
very fine intervals is that they will display differences that are totally insignificant and
dont amount to anything  but if we present it people will start thinking that we must
think it means something  so i think we really will aggravate the communication
process and therefore we ought to look at what the appropriate number of significant
digits is  i am not trying to obfuscate the differences  i am trying to make sure that we
focus on differences that are genuine  if we have a real difference that is 05 percentage
point apart well so be it  there is no reason in my view that we shouldnt present it and
explain it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i strongly support the proposals that
you have laid out  i appreciate your doing so  they have helped focus this discussion
besides agreeing with the proposals i also agree with the reasoning that you have set out
as to why this is the right step and why it is an important step  it doesnt go all the way to
having a single agreedupon inflation objective but i do think its a major step in that
direction  given the political realities and sensitivities and the differences of opinion and
comfort level with moving wholly in that direction i think this is a very constructive
step  it moves us forward and it doesnt preclude other measured steps later on  it
would worry me to take this step if there were a huge difference among us about the
quantitative definition of an appropriate price stability objective  but it is clear that the
range of difference is not very broad 1 to 2 in the grand scheme of things seems to me
to be very minor  certainly at this point going out to a third year it seems to me will be
very informative to the public
i really like the idea that having talked about our individual comfort zones we
will be able to get out of the current phase of being very reluctant to talk about this topic
at all  it would be good to express in our own speeches something that reflects a
committee objective  i think that 1 to 2 as a range of what we think of as price stability
is adequate and will be useful  it will let us clearly explain our objectives and our
strategy for using monetary policy to achieve them which is something we really havent
done much of and i think thats a good thing to do
i am really torn about your proposal about whether or not we should go beyond
three years  we are lucky at this point that we are awfully close to the range that we
think we would like to be in  but if at some future date we were a lot further from the
objective i could easily imaginegiven my own view of the tradeoffs between the
employment and inflation goalsthat three years would be an insufficient period for you
to look at my projection and see what my view of price stability was  so at some future
date having a range as short as that could be problematic  however going from three to
five years has a disadvantage in that we will in effect be laying out something that the
congress is likely to view as an employment goal or an unemployment goal and i am
worried about taking that step  so i am really torn about it
just a bit on a few specificsi think that four times a year is appropriate  i like
our sharing our projections among the committee members it has been helpful in
understanding what other people think and in facilitating our own discussion  i think the
staff has done a wonderful job of producing the narrative  a major thing that we can
provide to the public is to lay out our reasoning about the economy  it is being nicely
done and i think we really have that in good shape  i like the idea of a total inflation
number  i like the cpi because of its familiarity but could certainly live with the pce as
well  i like appropriate policy  there have been a lot of concerns in the committee
about projecting the fed funds rate  in the past i have been where president plosser is
now in terms of wanting to reveal that to the public but many good reasons have been
advanced in our discussions about why we shouldnt do that at least for now  with
respect to the concern that if we are very specific in our own submissions it will
eventually become public my own feeling is that in this round just asking people do
you agree with greenbook or are there any significant differences has been quite
informative and is sufficient
i like the treatment of uncertainty in this round  asking people to put down their
own numbers was false precisioni really didnt like that  providing some table of
modelbased or forecastbased historical averages is very helpful if combined with some
qualitative discussion  i am a little worried about the histograms  they are nice
graphical devices  but are they really informative about something we want to inform
the public about  i share some of the concerns that have been expressed about outliers
and whether or not we want to focus attention on them  with respect to timing of the
forecasts i really think we should not be adding information in those projections that
goes beyond what we had at the meeting  it will be very confusing if we try to do so  i
feel that we should have the projections finalized either on the day of the fomc meeting
or shortly thereafter but not based on any additional information
with respect to publication i agree with president moskows thoughts that
putting the projections out as an appendix to the minutes is desirable though we will
have to be careful about what we say in the discussion  we can then also include them in
the monetary policy report  i do like the idea of expediting the minutes especially if we
figure out a way to be able to read them on our blackberrys  we ought to be able to do
thatmost of the compression in time to cut it down to two and a half weeks comes in
terms of our own response time  i think that we can respond quickly especially if we can
get them while were traveling  i like the idea of being able to use the minutes in our
speeches  we have not yet talked about the statement but i think getting the minutes out
more quickly will also take a little pressure off the statement  if the staff can find a way
to write the first part of the minutes and we can present it as the staffs information that
they brought into the meeting that will also take a burden off the minutes and i hope it
will take some burden off the staff
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i also think that your strawman
proposal really does strike the right balance and i strongly support it  we probably owe
it to you between now and the fall or whenever you feel appropriate to be able to go
forward with an announcement to keep our discussion in this room  our confidentiality
around this discussion for the past year has been incredibly helpful and it does strike me
that your ability to frame something that fairly represents your views and our views
without having any of it previewed by us wittingly or unwittingly is awfully important
in terms of additional reasons that i think we have the right balance in your
proposal there has been a discernible difference in the markets in putting data
dependence into practice  in seeing how the financial markets have reacted to data sets
and how they have struggled with what those data have meant i think that they seem to
have come a long way from a year or two years ago in understanding how we process
data rather than looking at the width and depth of our briefcases or the winks and nods of
our statements  i cant help but think that we have really made some progress down that
path  by putting the projections first and foremost on our list of deliverables to come we
are going to continue to ask them to do their own homework as opposed to relying on us
if we were to go a step or two beyond that at this point we might undermine some of
those good market practices that are starting to bear some fruit
the markets judge us by our actions and not by our words and that is why i must
say that i dont think any of these iterations or any of these proposals that we have
discussed is a panacea in and of itself  these proposals and iterations constitute an
appropriate framework for us to continue our dialogue with the markets  by taking this
next step we are going to put some of our words into action by generating these
projections quarterly and seeing what responses we get  i tend to think that we are going
to learn quite a bit through that process  as others have said while the economic
environment is apparently benign i think that the political environment and the financial
markets are probably somewhat less so  maybe that suggests to me another reason for
taking appropriate steps and not going beyond them at this point  finally i dont think
the financial markets are asking for more than your proposal suggests  i think tim has it
right in some waysthey are still just asking for the answer key  what we are doing
here is finally telling them that we are not going to give them the answer key but that we
will tell them more about what were thinking  that will be more than sufficient to that
constituency and over time we can revisit what we are doing
in terms of details i will refer to only three items  first on whether we should be
making our projections under appropriate policy or sharing a fed funds rate path i am
incredibly concerned that policy forecasts would be misunderstood to be policy
commitments  again i think that would undermine much of the good work that weve
done  second regarding the anonymity of projections and the points that president
fisher made i am a little uncomfortable with even these numbers of 1 through 19 with
each of our projections because i think that the veil that we have around us could well be
pierced  another way for us to get the benefit of that might be for us to individually
submit our projections to the staff  then when the staff circulates them for us to review
they would have the projections aggregated to the extent that we can see granularity but
not be listed as numbers 1 through 19  obviously that can be done a lot of ways  but i
am very concerned that if we were to go with individual projections we would have
calls and speculation that would make us all hunker down and somehow explain why we
are where we are and be somewhat less interested in hearing where our colleagues are or
in modifying our projections over time  so i would favor even a step back on
anonymitybut only enough obviously to give us a view of where our colleagues are
third the question that requires probably the most time among the issues that
have been raised is the third year versus some threetofiveyear average  i could change
my views on this but my instinct is that if we were to adopt a threetofiveyear window
for that set of data it might look just a little too cute  i would prefer that we all do our
best to say this is about projections  as we get into a third year our crystal balls are
cloudier than they are over shorter periods  over time if we were to do that with a third
year in our own ways and our own speeches we could be elaborating on what that third
year means to us  to some of us it might be aspirational  to some of us it might be
opportunistic  but i would hesitate to go further than that at this point  but again i
think this is the right path forward and obviously discussion will continue  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser had an intervention
mr plosser  yes  i just want to make one comment about the issue of the fed
funds path  both vice chairman geithner and governor warsh made a comment about
the markets  when i hear you talk about the markets i am struck that it is a very narrow
definition of what the markets care about  you are looking at it in the context of what the
financial markets care about is only what the funds rate iswhat our path is going to be
i think that is much too narrow a way to think about what we are trying to do here  to
say that they dont care about inflation and that they care only about the funds rate is a
slippery slope  whether it is just a financial adviser who is worried about inflation
planning for his clients or people who are investing long term and trying to make
decisions about housing or other things i think it does go back to inflation  it is not just
about what the markets think the fed funds rate is going to be  in that regardi am going
to go out on a limb a bit hereto the extent that longerterm decisions or the prices of
longerterm assets such as longerterm bonds move frequently with shortrun funds rate
decisionssometimes more sometimes lessthat really tells us something about what
they are expecting the path to be in the future  they are trying to infer something about
our future path from one decision  to the extent that we can provide some more certainty
or shape to that path as it relates to our inflation objectives or our inflation ranges that we
want to talk about we are going to change that dynamic between short and long rates in a
way that will remove some of that uncertainty and some of that speculation about what
the path is going to be even though we can at the same time convey some uncertainty
about our individual perspectives about that  so i think we want to be careful not to
become too focused on what tomorrows market response will be and what they care
about because i think it goes beyond just that  i just wanted to share that with the group
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  if i could just add to that  i had a similar reaction to vice
chairman geithner  when we targeted money supply growth markets reacted to money
supply growth figures because they thought we were going to react to money supply
growth  if red sox victories influence a fed funds rate setting the market would react to
the red sox  obviously we are going to manipulate the fed funds rate in response to
inflation  i dont think that is going to drop off the table anytime soon  so it sort of
sounds great to say that they dont care about inflation that they care about the fed funds
rate  well they are going to care about inflation if they care about the fed funds rate
vice chairman geithner  perhaps i could say my piece again just so he
didnt misinterpret it  of course they care about inflation and of course they care about
whether we are going to competently deliver acceptable inflation outcomes over time
my only point was to say that even if you gave them clarity on an objective at a certain
horizon in quantitative terms fundamentally they would still want to know how you are
going to achieve that and you are still going to leave unmet their principal demand  of
course they care about inflation and we care about inflation  but i believe that the
differences they are concerned about todaya central tendency that has a 50 basis point
spread on itare small compared with the uncertainty that they would like us to resolve
about how we are going to react to stuff  what they really want is something that i dont
think we can fundamentally give them  they really want more certainty than we have at
any given time about how we are going to react to a changing world and they would like
us to resolve the mystery in what the future will hold about the evolution of the economy
it is important to recognize that  but you are right of course they care about inflation
and how were going to react to inflation
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  i would just like to add a comment in favor of uncertainty for
the markets  uncertainty is important in how markets work  uncertainty is critical to
market participants forming their own views about the future and managing the risks as
they see them in the future  everybody talks about the famous greenspan put  we know
greenspan is going to be there to save us if the market overdoes it so lets just play into
the rising market because the fed will save us if everything tanks  that is an overdone
argument but i have heard it made  if we give people a policy path no matter how we
characterize it they are going to take that as far more a given than we could ever really
commit to and they are going to make bets on that basis  when those bets dont work
out it is going to be another version of the fed leading them down the garden path  i
really think we should not go there  we should encourage some uncertainty in markets
about what our actual policy path is going to be given that over a threeyear period or a
threetofiveyear period the range of the committees preferences around inflation is
within some narrow band  let the markets figure out what they think incoming data
prescribe in terms of policy and make their bets on that basis  i think a certain degree of
uncertainty is absolutely healthy for markets
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i thank vice chairman geithner for clarifying his views  i
couldnt agree more that there is a vast range of uncertainty out there about which we
cant help markets and they cant help us  we would all like to know more about the
future  that is why it is imperative to me at least that we focus on resolving the
uncertainty we can resolve  foremost on that list would be our coming to terms with
decisions that we eventually will have to make about our intentions  just leave it at that
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  well i too strongly am in favor of the direction you have
proposed mr chairman and the reasons that you laid out for moving in this direction  i
would urge us to move as promptly as is practical down this path  i am fairly flexible
about many of the specifics that would accompany this path because i think there is more
than one way to skin the cat and i think it is important that we get there
before i get to some of the specifics let me just say that i went back and looked
at a fairly recent chronology of our changes to communication going back to 1994  i
dont know whether i got everything all actions were not equally significant and of
course we dont have the counterfactuals so we dont know what would have happened
had we not taken these steps  but i think it is fair to say that all our increases in
communication beginning with the press releases back in 1994 up through the expediting
of the minutes and so forth with the benefit of hindsight have worked out well  they
have worked out well in part because we give these things pretty careful consideration
and long deliberation before we move ahead  i think we have done that in this case as
well and so we are well positioned now to move ahead with this
as far as some of the specifics go yes i would be in favor of the quarterly
frequency  for now i would favor sticking with the threeyear horizon  i am not
particularly opposed to a longer one but at least to date i think the threeyear horizon
would be a significant advance  it seems to have worked out reasonably well as far as the
trial runs are concerned and i would do that  in terms of the general shape of the latest
trial run the level of anonymity and so forth that was all fine with me so i wouldnt see
any need to make any particular changes with regard to that  with regard to the form in
which the projections should be released i think i would come down in favor of
president moskows suggestion as some sort of appendix to the minutes  i think that will
give us more flexibility over time and it will not be a big problem to make sure that
whatever we say in the minutes is consistent with those projections  i think that is a
manageable issue so i would favor that  i would also favor cutting off the projections as
soon as possible after the meeting for a couple of reasons  one is that not doing it raises
the potential for confusion of what we know and when we know it which we can and
should avoid
i also think that we dont really want to put much emphasis on highfrequency
data  just because you get one or two more observations most of the time they dont
make much difference but even when they seem to indicate a significant departure from
what we had expected they are subject to revision or the next observation we get a day or
two later may work in the opposite direction  it just doesnt seem to me that there is a lot
of advantage to emphasizing them
i would be in favor of expediting the minutes but i think i would defer that for
now just because we are talking about some major steps  we ought to get those in place
first and we can come back and think about expediting the minutes shortly thereafter
assuming that this all works out well if thats what we want to do  there are probably
good reasons to do it at the end of the day but i dont view that as quite as important as
some of the other things were talking about at this point  with that thats all i want to
say  i think we are in the process of making some significant progress here and i am
encouraged by that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i too applaud your putting a
concrete proposal on the table  with a committee of nineteen and as many moving parts
as this could have we could end up with a camel when we wanted a horse and therefore
having something concrete to react to is very helpful
having said that i have looked at this question both at the strategic level and at
the tactical level  let me just comment on the strategic level first  the way i process the
question is that it is based on principles in some respect and some of the principlebased
objectives are 1 transparency in governance is a best principle in general and this
moves in that direction 2 it should enhance accountability 3 it should enhance public
confidence in our credibility and 4 it should enhance the influence on outcomesthat
is to say it should have a grounding in results and the optimal outcome should involve
somewhat less risk  i am trying to process the thrust of my decisions through that
strategic prism  so i asked myself under what circumstances this could backfire and i
think the answer is perhaps that in periods of very rapid change volatility turbulence
severe shocks and the aftermath of severe shocks we could find this degree of
explicitness and degree of openness problematic  but i dont think we can manage to
those kinds of contingencies  i think we have to manage more with a view of normal
times
i see here in the committee some tension as we address this question between a
mystique model of effectiveness which perhaps optimizes flexibility and gives us an
opportunistic posture and therefore is built around closed deliberation and a transparent
explicit exposed out there model  they both have some benefits in terms of our
ultimate effectiveness  so i view it as a bit of a balancing act between those two  but as
i said i support the thrust because i think the principle of transparency and accountability
trumps that of maximum flexibility if those two things under certain circumstances are
opposed  i am influenced mr chairman by your and don kohns sense that this is
incremental  it is a step and therefore is adjustable  it may not be reversible but it is at
least adjustable and that means that we can tweak the overall tactical aspects of it to get
it to work as efficiently and as effectively as possible
as to some of the specifics yes we should proceed  four times a year seems
right and i think we have to line it up with the monetary policy reports  i like the idea
of total inflation because i think that is where people live for the most part  i see the
narrative best done as an addendum  regarding anonymity i would say that not being
anonymous might be too much disclosure so i support anonymity  on the third year i
think of the third year as a statement of intentions  it is our intended steady state if we
can get there  i do see a tradeoff there  having a single third year is more consistent with
accountability but it puts credibility a bit more at risk  so as i listen to the debate on
that i am somewhat influenced by vice chairman geithners approach of allowing for
more flexibility in the outyears  this is not a moon landing  we cant be precise in
where it comes out in the thirtysixth month  we are in a world of shocks and
uncertainty so i on balance favor the idea of buying us some flexibility in the threeto
fiveyear timeframe  i like the qualitative characterizations particularly of uncertainty
for the same reasons  i am not terribly in favor of accelerating the minutes for now  we
could do that at a later date after we have refined and nailed down some of the other
moving parts here  i dont think it buys us enough at this time so i would view that as a
refinement that might be made at a later date  let me leave it at that
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i share many of president lackers
concerns but i come to a different conclusion because i strongly support this proposal  it
is a major step but it is incremental  but id like to go through some of the issues that
president lacker discussed because i think that they relate to where we may be heading
in the future and how we may have to handle things now  the concerns that he raised are
very very important ones
the first is that a thirdyear or a threetofiveyear projection does not reflect a
commitment  we know that there are some very strong benefits to having a commitment
a particular thing thats important here is that being opportunistic in terms of changing
what our view is of where we will head in the future creates very bad expectations
dynamics  in fact it creates an antistabilizing influence rather than a prostabilizing
influence because when you overshoot you might tend to have higher projections
similarly when you might undershoot you might lower projections  this has become an
issue by the way in other countries  in countries that have inflation targets when they
were undershooting for a long time people actually pushed them to lower the inflation
goal  doing that turns out to have very negative effects on the economy because when
you get a negative shock to the economy people lower their expected inflation  that
raises the real interest rates and means that you have a contractionary impulse  thats
very problematic and a serious concern that we have to worry about  ill talk about how i
think we can deal with some of these issues
second i also very much worry about the issue of the projections  although they
have the benefit of giving information about what peoples views of our inflation goals
are they could be interpreted in relation to output and unemployment as also being speed
limits goals or whatever  in the end that is a very dangerous thing to happen
the third thing that i think is an important concern is that without a consensus of
this committee it is much harder to deliberate  it will be much harder to write our
statements  i have been struggling with this  i am willing to go along on this for a period
of time because we are still not there yet and a question is whether we can get to a
consensus  so i am willing to hold off  but there will be a point at which some of us
may say gee i cant sign on to that statement unless a consensus is built  i think that
problem could become serious in the future
so how do we deal with these issues  the reason that im comfortable with this
step at this point is that through speeches we can clarify some of these issues  so for
example if we go with this approach i would give a speech and say that although some
information is here about inflation objectives we should not think about it as having
information about unemployment or output objectives because we have much uncertainty
about what potential gdp or the nairu is and furthermore we cant control either  so
i think that we can clarify some issues in speeches  im sure that the chairman will do it
the point that i think is relevant and the reason i am discussing these issues is
that people have to realize that even though this step is exactly the right way to proceed
it will still leave us with problems and the reality is that we will have to deal with them
the advantage of proceeding this way is that it gives flexibility particularly to the
chairman for dealing with the political considerations
eventually we will have to go to a numerical inflation goal  not doing so will get
more and more untenable over time  a question is what is the right time to do it  what
is the right time in terms of the political environment  what is the right time in terms of
where the economy is  so people have to be aware that this is really a first step  to be
honest i will not be satisfied with this as the end game  at the same time the question
is when would be the appropriate time to move forward from here  we will have to use
our best judgment on this question and the chairman will have to use his judgment as
well  so i am very supportive of this proposal but i want to make clear that i think that
were not settling the issues  im sure we will have to deal with them in the future and i
think we will deal with them in the future  so those are the general issues
let me go to some of the specifics  the issue about the horizon is really very
tricky  i am very comfortable right now with a threeyear horizon because things are
working out pretty well  thank goodness the economy has been coming out pretty much
in line with our forecaststhat we actually have inflation coming down and that it is very
close to what the goal of anybody on this committee would be because we are all
between 1 and 2 percent  given a goal of 1 or 2 percent and a threeyear horizon we
should get approximately there  so i do not think theres a problem now with a three
year horizon  however i dont see this as stable because god forbid there could be
cases when we get shocks and where we are substantially away from where we want to
be and then a threeyear horizon will not be adequate  president yellen and vice
chairman geithner made this point  the issue here is that doing three years now is fine
but we will have to rethink this in the future  at some point we may have to go to a
longer horizon or the alternative will be that we will have objectivesso it is one or the
other  i think people know where i stand on that issuei have a preference  right now
im actually very comfortable with three years because three years plus a longrun
inflation goal will provide the information that people need  if we dont have a longrun
inflation goal then at some point if things dont go right we may need a fiveyear
horizon as well
i get concerned about providing a federal funds rate path  i am known as a person
who is very protransparency but i wrote a paper called can central bank transparency
go too far  the problem here is exactly the one that governor warsh and others have
mentioned  even though we know that when you put out a path it is completely
contingent on events and a lot of uncertainty is around it making that clear to the public
is very hard particularly to politicians who want to use things in their own way  its
amazing when you testify in the congress youll say something and then they will try to
use whatever you say in a way exactly opposite to what you said  everybody knows it is
exactly opposite but they will do it anyway  so you have to be very careful with what
you put out there  this has been a problem with other central banks  the swedes
actually had problems when they first announced their path because they didnt clarify
the uncertainty and some problems arose in the marketplace  we shouldnt rule it out in
the future but it is a tough thing to think about  for the time being i would certainly not
advocate it and i have serious concerns about it
on the issue of the cpi versus the pce a lot of details are here and my view is to
let the subcommittee decide  ill go with whatever they want here  i do have a
preference for the cpi but it is very slighti dont even think its a second order issue
maybe third order its not really critical  an advantage is that cpi is better known  vice
chairman geithner mentioned it is actually involved in a lot of contracts  one reason
that the cpi is used is that it is not revised  that turns out to be the reason that i lean to
the cpi rather than the pce  i think the pce is a slightly better measure but the cpi is
not revised which will make our lives simpler because we know that were making
decisions exante with the information we have now  however when the pce gets
revised people can secondguess you  weve had this in the past when our pce was
getting very close to 1 percent  it turned out to be revised quite a bit upward and then
people said gee why werent you tougher on inflation  so i think that using the cpi
has a politicaleconomy advantage even if there is a slight disadvantage from a technical
viewpoint
i share some peoples concerns about the histograms  but i love to see the
histograms  they were very useful to me  i like them because they provide information
and actually show that there is less diversity  what was remarkable about themand i
dont think that this will be a problem in the futureis how close we generally are  i
think that actually will help dissipate some of the issues in the press  but again i dont
feel particularly strongly about this issue
a very important issue that comes up here is where we put the enhanced
projections into our documents and their relationship to how quickly we do the minutes
i lean toward having the projections as a separate document in some form either as an
addendum or whatever because i think it gives us a lot of flexibility  i am going to say
something that may get me an ied improvised explosive device in my office later on
but well talk about that in a second  laughter  there is also an issue about the times of
the testimonies which are happening two times a year  i suspect that we will end up with
testimonies four times a year and in that context it may be difficult to have the full
minutes done within three weeks  we will definitely need to expedite the enhanced
projections  in fact if we have the flexibility of having a separate document we may be
able to do one and then do the other that way we can basically relieve some of the
pressure on people  were going to end up having to speed up the process on that part of
the picture so separating them to some extent has the advantage of giving us more
flexibility
so the last issue for which i may get the ied in my office and which i think is
going to happen even if i didnt propose it is that i think there really is an advantage to
having these enhanced projections as part of a monetary policy report that is issued four
times a year  my suspicion is that we will be in a situation when we do this that the
congress will likely want testimony more often  i am sorry for the chairman here but i
would welcome the increased testimony because it gives us a bully pulpit from which to
provide more information to the markets and to tell them our point of view  i wouldnt
have to do the testimony but there is a little work because as a board we have to go
over the testimony  im going on vacation so we have to do a conference call about the
testimony  i will have to do that four times a year so there is a little cost for me but more
for the chairman  having a monetary policy report with these enhanced projections will
actually be a plus  again it gives us an opportunity to express our views and i suspect
that it will actually end up improving the quality of the monetary policy report  it could
be an important part of our communication process
now let me mention an issue so that i dont get the ied but instead just a water
gun shot at me by the staff  we have a really serious problem right now in that our staff
at the board is getting severely overwhelmed by work  that is of great concern to me
and i think to other members of the board  the situation is such that if we dont fix it i
think the staff will break  this means that we have to think about the products that the
staff produces for us  do we absolutely need them  even if we like them a bit if theyre
very costly to produce do we need them  this will be an issue going forward  the
process that we are talking about now will increase work for the staff  if we do a
monetary policy report four times a year it will be even worse  we may need to think
about what goes on in terms of fomc documents  can they be done in a more efficient
way  do we need certain information  what is the most efficient way to run a research
operation  the issue here also is that there has become a discrepancy in terms of the
workload for the board staff versus the research staff at the banks  i think that it is great
that the banks actually have the research that is coming from them which has greatly
improved over time  that is a major positive for the system  but the discrepancy in
terms of workload which is killing our staffif in fact their work is increasing relative to
that of the banksis not a healthy situation for the system in the long run  so one of the
things that i am proposing is more work in a sense but the committee will need to think
about the issues of how we can use our staff more efficiently to continue to provide us
with all the services we need so that the quality of work does not decrease  if its done
right it can improve the quality of work for us and can actually take some of the pressure
off the staff  so im doing this so that i dont end being a victim of jihadism but i
actually strongly believe it  thank you very much mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you governor  well first of all let me
thank everyone for extremely thoughtful and helpful remarks  we will be looking at
them the staff will be looking at them we will proceed with this process and we will try
to converge to the document that ultimately will be the one that will be the format that we
will be using  so we will be in touch with you about perhaps further questions and we
will be doing another trial run for the next meeting
we do want to have a few thoughts from you on the statement  let me propose
the following  lets take a halfhour break for lunch  when we come backive
conferred with governor kohn about thislet me just ask you to answer two questions
one in light of these proposed changes are you happy with the statement or is there a
change that you would make  two are you happy with the approval governancethe
process by which we now construct the statement  the answer could be yesyes nono
laughterclearly 300 pm is the dropdead deadlinebut i hope that we can have a
very quick and efficient goround on those two questions  so lets take a break for lunch
now and come back in half an hour
lunch break
chairman bernanke  let us reconvene  again thank you for the very
useful discussion before lunch  let me just remind you that we need to keep this discussion
within this room  it would be destructive to the whole process if we had it leak out in the
next few months  so we appreciate your doing that
the last item of business is just to do a goround on the statement  remember there
are two questions  first given where we seem to be going on using projections and the
other elements we discussed do you think that the statement is okay  what suggestions do
you have for changing it  second do you have any comments on the consultative
governance issues  who would like to begin  president hoenig
mr hoenig  as far as the statement now goes the way i would phrase it is that i
can live with what we have  if i may anticipate president minehan just a little bit i would
like to see it simpler and shorter as we go forward especially if we can move the minutes
closer to the meeting date as we discussed here earlier  that would enable us to do that
thats my first comment  on the governance i think the way we do it right now is fine  if
we are going to have the statement as it is now structured the process seems to be working
and i dont see any need again to vote on it
mr kohn  could i add to the governance question the issue of what we vote on
as a committee  should we vote on the whole statement or just the first and fourth sections
as we do now
mr hoenig  well i guess the way i would answer that is i would not change the
way we do it now because im not sure if its the first or the fourth section  laughter
chairman bernanke  so the practical implication is that it really wouldnt be
legitimate if we agree with that to dissent on the description of the economy or inflation
mr hoenig  thats right
chairman bernanke  if we agree on thatbut we will hear what people
have to say  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you  im basically happy with the statement as it is now  its
not exactly where i thought i would come out honestly  but if you look at it its really
pretty straightforward and does what it needs to doby which i mean that it provides a
concise but i would say valuable rationale for the decision  that has to include and it
does something thats forward looking a bit because obviously with the lags in policy were
not just making decisions based on looking in the rearview mirror  i dont think its too
long  its only if i counted this up right seven sentences or something like that  that
doesnt strike me as excessively long  in fact other things being equal i would probably be
in favor of adding to it rather than reducing it but i dont think its worth the effort based on
my experience around this table in recent years  laughter  so i think it does what it should
do and does it reasonably effectively  i have no inspirations i guess for how to improve it
in any significant way  i do think it will continue to evolve just as the economy the outlook
for the economy and the position of policy do  thats inevitable
as far as governance is concerned i would prefer voting on the entire statement but
i dont think that the current system is so badly broken that we absolutely positively need to
do something about it  but it seems as though we spend a fair amount of time on it so i
dont know why we wouldnt at the end of the day vote on it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you  i think the statement is okay  i am a little concerned that
we modify it case by case  today we had this issue about elevated or somewhat
elevated and how would we change that without giving a message that we dont intend  i
dont know whether we can craft language that would avoid that sort of casebycase issue
it seems to me that after we go through the projections exercise we might want to come
back to that  on governance i could go either way  i think its okay the way it works
because we fully discuss the issue  if theres sentiment to vote on the full thing thats fine
too
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you  im basically happy with the statement the way it is
now  like president stern i was leaning on the side of making it shorter but when i started
to look at where i would cut it was very hard to come up with places to cut  i dont think
that adopting some of the changes that you outlined earlier will shorten the statement  it
could change how we characterize elements of the statement especially the rationale
section  when we talk about economic growth we can characterize it more as it relates to
the central tendency projections that weve provided  then when we characterize inflation
rather than using words like remains elevated or will moderate further the public will
have the benefit of our projections on a quarterly basis and it might be easier then to
describe how we view the inflation situation  then also by adopting a total measure for
inflation it will be easier and again clearer when were saying words like inflation or
inflationary pressures  the public will better understand what measure were looking at
so i dont think that the new approach or the revised approach would change the length but
it might help us in the communication process and im happy with the way that were doing
the risk assessment in the statement now
in terms of governance i think that the public views the statement as a product of
the committee deliberations and for that reason i think having the committee vote on the
full statement would be helpful  in that regard vice chairman geithner made a comment
earlier about if we go that approach lets make fewer changes at the table and focus on
giving our input to the statement before the meeting  if we do some of the editing at the
table we dont have time to reflect on how those changes will be interpreted  so having
fewer changes at the table would be helpful  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  i like the statement as is  i was one of those who when we
considered accelerating the release of the minutes thought that it would take some weight
off crafting the statement which we could shorten  alas i was incorrect and that was sort
of hopeless  so im giving up  i sort of like the length the statement is now  it does a
reasonable job with what it does with one exceptionthe last section the socalled
balanceofrisk assessment  ive argued this many times when weve talked about this  the
intention is to convey the likely next direction of interest rate changes  our general practice
has beenthere have been some exceptionsto describe the risks to the things we care
about and we invite people to deduce what we think of as the likely next direction of
interest rate moves by inverting our policy reaction function somehow  i always thought
that was problematic needlessly obscure and i liked the times when we crafted that
statement fairly directly and explicitly with phrases like policy firming
about the balanceofrisk assessments i hesitate to put something else on the table
but we ought to think about the directive too because the balanceofrisk assessment came
into the statement because it was in the directive and there was a tilt statement in the
directive that originated in the 80s as a way of providing the committees sense of
constraint on the chairmans discretion to make intermeeting moves  thats my
understanding of how it arose  then it came to be about the next meeting when we did
intermeeting moves and now its just sitting there in the directive and i dont know what
good it does in the directive really  you know we dont make intermeeting moves   i dont
know what our understanding is about discretion about intermeeting moves  i think that
were supposed to have a conference call with everybody  so i dont know why we need
this little directive in there and it seems to me you could just take it out of the directive
about governance im in favor of voting on the whole thing  i remember talking at
one point with i think it was you mr chairman and others about how it is backward for us
to talk about the statementto do negotiations about the statementa week before we even
talk to each other or read the greenbook  but i dont think thats so problematic  it doesnt
end up putting our feet in cement really and i think weve been able to have sufficient
flexibility during the meeting despite what we said the week before  so i dont view that as
terribly problematic
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  regarding the first question the statement i think the process is
working well at this point and so i dont see any need for major changes in it  given the
consensus on moving forward on these projections i think that fits in quite well with the
existing process we have for the statement  my feeling is to minimize forwardlooking
comments in the statement  we never used to do this and then we got into it with phrases
like considerable period and patience and so forth and then we evolved to a statement
in which we say future policy adjustments depend on the evolution of the outlook for
inflation and so forth and the data coming in  so we dont really have a forwardlooking
statement currently but my preference is to use forwardlooking statements only when it
really is important to serve a specific purpose for the committee  i tend to agree with jeff
lacker that you could drop the last part of the statement
on the governance issue it seems artificial not to vote on the entire statement
because we spend so much time talking about all parts of it  so on balance i would say yes
we should vote on the entire statement  one issue was raised in the background material
about whether the statement should be the chairmans or the committees  i think it should
be the committees  it would put the chairman in an awkward position not to have it as a
statement of the committee  if it wasnt a statement of the committee people would try to
pull us apart by asking us questions individually as to whether we agree with the
chairmans statement  so i think the process we have now is just right and that it should
be a committee statement
chairman bernanke  just to clarify your comment on forwardlooking
language your examples were about policy like considerable period or whatever but not
necessarily  does your comment apply to statements like output is going to grow at a
moderate pace
mr moskow  no i should have clarified that  no in terms of comments in the
statement about the outlook for the economy yes i think thats fine  i was thinking of the
outlook for policy
mr kohn  i also had a twohander on that  so in terms of things like
predominant concern which is kind of forward looking for what our concern is in the
future would you have that or would you cut out the whole fourth section
mr moskow  no when appropriate i would keep that  but i was thinking
primarily of the last sentence that we had happen there  my recollection is that it evolved
from a considerable period to patience and so forth and then we got into it will depend
on the outlook for inflation and economic growth
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  im not sure i heard you clearly mike but i want to clarify  i was
advocating eliminating the risk assessment from the directive but i would keep that section
in the statement
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  well thank you mr chairman  i think the statement is just about
right  i like the current length and structure  i would not want to see a great deal more detail
in it about our assessment of the economy  i think that should wait for the minutes but i
dont think theres anything thats in the statement now that we should cut  the statement
has evolved and we have in practice avoided doing something formulaic in terms of the
balance of risks  we do not have the same language all the time  we sometimes use
forwardlooking policy language and sometimes we dont  thats good  i think we should
avoid anything formulaic and just do whats appropriate in the given conditions  when we
were on a path of raising the fed funds rate from 1 percent and we had every expectation
that we would be involved in a series of steps over time it would have been highly artificial
to avoid indicating in the statement that this was our expectation  it was important to signal
it using forwardlooking language  so i wouldnt want to take forwardlooking language off
the table  it doesnt seem too important now when our own expectation is for a flat path  so
i think the statement is working well  im really amazed at how well the process of drafting
the statement is working too
mr mishkin  well considering the group  laughter
ms yellen  initially when we started getting into circulating ideas about it
before the meeting i thought oh this is going to be chaotic and spin out of control  ive
been amazed at how thoroughly constructive it has beenthat by the time we walk in here
and have the statement it has actually evolved a fair amount  i think it has always been an
improvement and we have been able to have drafting sessions and they have worked out
surprisingly well
on the governance i think this thing has accidentally fallen into a governance hole
and it needs to be cleaned up  the committee should vote on the whole statement  thats
what the outside world thinks now they just havent noticed that we dont
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much  im relatively happy with the statement
along the lines that presidents yellen and moskow discussed i would try to stay away as
much as possible from forwardlooking language or commitments  theres a time and a
place2003 going forward  moving from 1 percent up was a unique occurrence i think
so i would really focus the statement as we mostly do now on what we did and why we did
it  why we did it has a forwardlooking component to it  it has to depend on what we
expect the economy to look like in the future and where we expect inflation to go
something referencing both of those things has to be in there  if i had my druthers id be
agnostic about whether or not we do an assessment of risk each and every time rather
consider what that adds to or possibly subtracts from in terms of the statement  so i
wouldnt be committed to doing a section 4 each and every time  its really good to the
extent we can do it to stay away from formulaic language and to focus the statement as
much as we can on what the realities are at the time of what we did and why we did it
in terms of process with anything edited by nineteen people the process is not
always optimal  getting a little sense of where the staff is the week before is helpful  it has
allowed people myself included from time to time to weigh in to actually be heard before
the meeting and to make some changes to the draft statement that we look at in the meeting
i can understand the desire not to do too much editing around the table  however i thought
that one of the reasons that we went to more twoday meetings was so we could all get a
read on what others were saying and thinking on the one day think about it and any
implications it had for what we said and how we said it overnight and then bring those
thoughts to the table the next day  i always thought that there was a lot of logic to the
process and that it probably adds to rather than subtracts from the amount of comments
around the table particularly when you find yourselves in a bit of a tenuous or dicey
situation with regard to how to characterize how people are feeling about things  so i think
id be willing to bear a little more noise around the table rather than a little less
on the governance issues i think this started as the chairmans statement because
nobody had the stomach for nineteen people editing  so it was better to let it be the
chairmans statement and therefore we didnt have the right to edit it  now of course we
edit it so it doesnt seem reasonable to me not to vote on the entire statement  i think its
easy enough to make that change  the whole thing is so esoteric anyway that i cant
imagine that anybody aside from us knows that we dont vote on it or has even focused on
it  the idea that people are going to dissent on the statement  were not dissenting on
policy  i find it difficult to think that dissenting on the statement is going to be a big issue
but it is always possible i suppose  were there any other governance issues  i think i
probably said this  the current approval process is difficult but given the ability to look at
some form of a draft the week before to be able to think overnight and provide some
substance to the editing process the next day i think it works okay
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i think the statement should be a statement of the
committee  i dont have any problem with the current governance structure although i
think it does make sense for everybody to vote on it since we hammer it out anyway  i
wouldnt change the language  we do have one sentence that we always repeat which to
me is a giventhat our future policy actions will depend on the evolution of the outlook et
cetera et cetera  i guess we should say that every time but im not sure we have to say that
every time  its a given  otherwise id keep it the same although i promise to continue to
lobby for the word global from here to infinity  laughter  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like the others i think the statement has
basically evolved into a very good place  i sometimes worry that the process of putting a
statement together by nineteen people will mean that theres too much inertia in the process
but so far maybe because the economy hasnt jerked around very much recently weve
been able to keep up  but i do think we need to make sure that the language doesnt lag the
events or if events start to move weve got to be willing to change the language even
though its hard here  i like the way the balanceofrisk section has evolved from talking
about whats going to happen to the funds ratei agree with president yellen that it was
appropriate in the particular circumstancesto talking about the righthand side of the
taylor rulethat is whats going to happen to the output or inflation gaps  so i think thats
positive  it gives a little very vague guidance about what the committee is most worried
about and i think thats probably helpful to the markets  that is then elaborated in the
minutes but it fills a threeweek gap before the minutes come out  certainly if we changed
our minds about where we saw the risks to the economy we would probably want to tell
people about that before those minutes come out  so basically youre in a pretty good place
here and it will continue to evolve  we just have to allow it to continue to evolve
on the governance side i think the editing is also going pretty well  when we got
into the premeeting editing i was a little concerned that the decisions were going to move
outside the room  but the process has evolved in a way that we get close to what the final
statement is in these premeeting sessions and then we can finetune the language at the
meeting  thats probably where we need to be if were going to put out a statement  so im
comfortable with where we are there  i think that most people outside this room think that
the committee is responsible for the whole statement and we probably ought to
acknowledge that by making the committee responsible for the whole statement  but if we
do that we ought to understand among ourselves that the hurdle for dissenting on words
should be very very high or else we will get ourselves into a governance mess  those are
my thoughts
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i like the statement format and process
and like governor kohn think that the governance while it is not urgent to change will
catch up with the reality and with the expectation  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks  much as gary stern has said as an academic i was
never particularly enamored of the statement  but actually having seen how it evolves how
it is builtusually when you see the way the sausage is made that upsets your stomach but
it has actually been the opposite  laughter  maybe i have been eating the sausage for too
long now  i dont know  laughter  ive been taken in by it  but i think as governor
kohn has said it has evolved in a way that many of the elements that i was more critical of
a few years ago are not there now  i think it operates in a perfectly reasonable way
some people have mentioned how the statement could change if we speed up the
minutes  were never going to speed up the minutes beyond say a week  even if we were
to get it to a week which i dont think is feasible the statement cant change all that much
we have to convey the information thats in the statement  i dont think we can say well
gee because next week were going to say something we can just cut it down to two
sentences or three sentences  as long as theres a week in between and i cant imagine
there being any less than a week in between the statement is going to have the kind of
information that it has in it which i think has evolved in a perfectly reasonable way
on governance since the process is working i dont really see the need to change it
theres a possibility that down the line that concurring opinions could be put out so that
people agree to whatever the monetary policy movement is but like the supreme court
write their own statement  since the process seems to be working well without leaving that
possibility for coming in i dont see that its necessary to make the change although im
open on that  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  in terms of this issue of forwardlooking language im quite
comfortable with the statement and with forwardlooking language so long as its on the
righthand side of the taylor rule in terms of whats going on with output and inflation  im
actually not a fan of forwardlooking language in terms of the federal funds rate and in fact
i differ from some people on this  i really didnt like it even during the unusual period
when there was some concern about deflationin that context it did have elements that
people might have interpreted as a commitment  it turned out that nothing bad happened
because the economy evolved in a reasonable way but i can think of scenarios during that
period particularly in 2004 and so forth when it might have been a real problem  so you do
have the statement at the end that were always contingent on events  i like that statement
but what i dont want to see is moving from that to what we did in that period except in the
most unusual circumstances  at the beginning it was justifiable in terms of concerns about
deflation but it actually had real potential problems that did not arise but i think we got
lucky  so im very comfortable with where we are right now  i think the editing process is
going well in terms of the meetingthere is finetuning going on but its done in a very
constructive way and i think its working well
in terms of governance i guess i lean toward the idea that we should vote on it for
the following reason  when you think about doing policy its not just what you do today
thats important  what you are signaling about the future is every bit as important  this is
the whole issue that the chairman has worked with mike woodford onthe issue of
managing expectations is not just what you do with the federal funds rate now its also the
path  in fact the projections that we are talking about doing are very much consistent with
that way of thinking  so the reality is that from a policy viewpoint what we say in the
statement is as important as what we do in voting on the federal funds rate  indeed since
ive been on the board thats been really the only issue because we really havent had much
debate about the federal funds rate decision  so in that sense if it is really important and it
is a key part of policy it makes sense for us to vote on it  im not worried about the issue of
dissents because the point that you made governor kohn that there should be a very high
barrier is exactly the way people have been proceeding  the barrier is fairly high for the
federal funds rate decision but in this case even more so  its just a couple of words and if
you dissent well to be honest then youre a jerk  laughter  i dont see any jerks here
so my feeling is that i dont think were going to have a big problem
mr stern  not anymore  laughter
mr mishkin  so im actually quite comfortable with moving in that direction
thank you very much
mr kohn  we have to put those words in the minutes so that they get out there
sooner than five years  laughter
mr mishkin  ill be an outlier in terms of the transcripts five years from now
theyll say oh god rick is here
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  it may horrify everyone at the table
that before i joined the committee i didnt actually parse this statement every few weeks
laughter  i dont have a lot of historical perspective but im basically okay with the way
the process works now  i think that the inclusions in the statement all serve a purpose  im
not sure i fully understand the right and the left side of the taylor rule rick but maybe
afterward you can explain that to me  i view this statement as having a short term  if there
are forwardlooking statements they are short term  they signal the next meeting or two
but not much more than that  regarding the governance or the voting issues i think we
should vote on the whole thing and if we ever need to have a tie breaker i guess i would
revert to its being at that time the chairmans statement  but in normal circumstances we
all vote and agree and thats it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i too am relatively new to this
process of watching the sausage being made  i have to confess up front that im a bit
schizophrenic about this because im really of two minds in terms of the direction i think
about and im persuadable either way  part of me as jeff said has argued that maybe the
forecasting exercise is going to take some pressure off all the nuances and the time we spend
on the statement  as governor kroszner mentioned no matter how soon we get the minutes
out its going to be tough to do that  so im sympathetic to that argument  my view is that
the minutes really provide the nuance of what goes on in the committee and i think thats
incredibly important  the only thing i worry about in terms of the statement is that it cant
provide that nuance and it gets so much attention in the marketplace so immediately so that
part of me says either we want to enrich the statement and get rid of some of the inertia
thats in it and make it longer or just make it shorter  so a part of me says that maybe what
we really ought to say in the statement is just section 1 and section 4 and let the nuance of
how we got there and what our views are be elaborated in the minutes  so a part of me says
that it would be a simplification that tells the markets what we did and how we view the
assessment of risk as we look at the economy but it doesnt try to tell them all of the details
of what went on  we let the minutes do that  i can live with the statement with way it is
but i think there might be some advantages in simplifying it so that we dont spend so much
time arguing over the nuances of the rationales and other things  besides that wed get
capacity utilization out of there if possible and just go with the overall assessment of the
risk and then let the minutes speak for themselves in terms of the nuances of the discussion
on the governance question i agree with everybody else  i think that it has been
implicitly a statement of the committee  the committee ought to vote on it  if you took
sections 2 and 3 out there would be a lot less wordsmithing and a lot less worrying about
whether the words were exactly right and what each of us might have meant or preferred to
say  so it might even make it easier to have a committee vote on that and theyd have to
worry about fewer things  those are just some thoughts
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i think the statement
has been evolving sensibly  the process is basically working  i dont think we need to lock
ourselves into any fixed view of the optimal structure of the statement over time  we should
be open to changing it if it suits our purposes in specific circumstances  obviously shaping
expectations about the stance of monetary policy is a vital part of what we do  im
pragmatic on all the questions about whether or not to have forwardlooking language
there are some circumstances in which it may make sense in the future as it has in the past
those should be exceptional circumstances and using it should be done very carefully and
thoughtfully  but we do not need to commit not to use it  i also think the basic structure of
saying something implicitly about the forecast the outlook on which our decision is based
is very important  so we should have something in there that refers to the expected path of
output and inflation and the risks to that generally as part of the signal  without that youd
lose a lot of value  i think id still be open to experimenting further as we have been doing
with introducing a bit more forwardlooking view about the outlook for demand and
inflation as part of the statement even though that will be hard to do well
on governance i have a very different view  i think that we really should stay in
this governance limbo that we now have  its very important to recognize that weve had a
huge amount of turnover in this committee  its important to give the chairman the
flexibility to ultimately be the arbiter of the nuance in the statement without having to go
through a process in which he will have to figure out whether hes prepared to have a vote
with significant dissent in that context  right now we have a process in which the
committee has substantial input into the shape of the signal thats in the statement  the
minutes actually say that the committee agreed that the statement should say x  its clear
that the committee is implicated in the statement  the chairman is obviously very
deferential to the views of the committee in shaping it but were close to 80 percent of the
way in having a formal endorsement by the committee of the statement  i dont see any
virtue in going the next 20 percent and a lot of virtue in preserving the possibility for the
chairman to say my sense is that we should do x i know thats not acceptable to all of
you and not have that come with something that forces a vote in that context  i just dont
think the balance we have now is problematic but i can envision a circumstance in which
the state of the world the state of the committee or a bunch of other things might make a
formal vote unnecessary and tilt the balance in a way that may not make sense for the
institutional structure we have  you know we have a group of nineteen not of seven
fundamentally the fed model institutionally is based on a strong chairman and id preserve
that particular remaining piece of that model
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any other comments  well
again well review the transcript and see what steps we need to take  once again thank you
for your very useful comments  the next meeting is tuesday august 7  if there is no other
business then were adjourned
end of meeting
