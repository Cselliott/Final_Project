transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of january 3031 2007
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everyone  let me be the first to welcome
bill dudley to the table
mr dudley  thank you  applause
chairman bernanke  today is our annual organizational meeting so we have a
few items to take care of
mr kohn  ill start if thats okay with you
chairman bernanke  go ahead governor kohn
mr kohn  before we get illegal here i am honored and pleased to nominate ben
bernanke to be chairman of the committee
chairman bernanke  thank you  objections  laughter
mr kohn  i need to interrupt again
chairman bernanke  yes
mr kohn  i am as pleased and as honored to nominate tim geithner to be vice chair
chairman bernanke  are there any objections  thank you very much  ms
danker will you read the list of staff officers of the fomc
ms danker  secretary and economist vincent reinhart deputy secretary debbie
danker assistant secretary michelle smith assistant secretary dave skidmore general
counsel scott alvarez deputy general counsel tom baxter economists karen johnson and
dave stockton associate economists from the board tom connors steve kamin brian
madigan larry slifman and david wilcox associate economists from the banks charlie
evans jeff fuhrer bob rasche gordon sellon and joe tracy
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any questions or comments
approved without objection  next on the agenda is a proposed change to committee rules  we
received a memo from scott alvarez and debbie danker which concerns how a backup would
be appointed in case the desk manager was unable to serve  are there any questions for our
colleagues on that memo
mr poole  i have a question  it has nothing to do with the changes but something
struck me this morning as i was reviewing this material again  let me refer you to the fomcs
rules of organization page 1  if a member or alternate ceases to be a president or first vice
president of a reserve bank a successor may be chosen in a special election by the boards of
directors of the appropriate reserve bank or banks and such successor serves until the next
annual election  now if jack guynn for example had retired last year in march atlanta had
filled the position and a president had been in place as of september lets say would he have
come back  this says no because it says until the next annual election  am i reading that
wrong  im not sure that has been even the practice in the past
ms danker  our general counsel can probably comment on that but i can try
mr alvarez  theres a little lawyer in all of us  laughter
ms danker  i believe the election that statement refers to is if a new president is
appointed and that person is then elected as a member by the boards of directors of the three
reserve banks he or she would serve until the next annual election at this time of year at which
point the successor would be elected from one of the other banks
mr poole  then i was not reading it correctly but you understand where my
confusion came from
mr alvarez  thats exactly right
mr poole  okay  so the alternate would serve until the next president was in office
that has certainly been the practice my question was about the wording  thank you
chairman bernanke  are there other questions about the memo  i need a vote
in favor  opposed  thank you  third we need to select a federal reserve bank to execute
transactions for the system open market account  governor kohn would you like to make a
proposal  laughter
mr kohn  i nominate the federal reserve bank of new york once again
chairman bernanke  comments  objections  without objection  the fourth
item is that we need to select the manager of the system open market account  governor
kohn
mr kohn  id be very pleased to nominate bill dudley as the manager of the system
open market account
mr fisher  you have to put your head down bill  laughter
mr poole  second
chairman bernanke  thank you  without objection  thank you
vice chairman geithner  i think we should rule out humor  laughter  this is
an important annual process and new york plays an important role
mr reinhart  so it will not say laughter in the margins  laughter
chairman bernanke  i think weve started on the wrong tone here  laughter
item 5 we need authorization for the desk operations  we have two items to vote on separately
on the domestic side we have a memo from bill dudley proposing to change the accounting of
repurchase agreements so they will be booked on the soma rather than on the books of the
frbny  are there any questions for bill  if not without objection  thank you  on the
foreign side mr dudley is proposing no change to the authorization directive or procedural
instructions  any questions  without objection  thank you  bill youre up
mr dudley1  thank you  in terms of market developments i would like to focus on three major topics  first is the sharp adjustment in market expectations concerning monetary policy since the last fomc meeting  second i will talk about the persistence of high risk appetites in credit markets with a focus on what may be the most vulnerable market in the united statesthe subprime mortgage sector
third i want to discuss the possible factors behind some of the sharp shifts we have seen in commodity prices since the last fomc meeting in particular whether these price movements reflect a shift in risk appetite among noncommercial investors or fundamental developments in supply and demand
first there has been a sharp shift in market expectations with respect to interest rates since the last meeting  at the time of the december meeting the consensus view among market participants was that the fomc would begin to lower its federal funds rate target this spring and that this easing process would continue into 2008 with cumulative rate cuts of about 75 basis points  as you can see in chart 1 which looks at the federal funds futures market and chart 2 which looks at the yield spreads between the march 2008 and the march 2007 eurodollar futures contracts expectations have shifted very sharply over the past month  there is now no easing priced in through midyear 2007 and a residual of only about 25 basis points of easing priced in beyond that  this shift in expectations can also be seen across the treasury yield curve  as chart 3 shows the treasury yield curve is now slightly above where it was at the time of october fomc meeting  since the december fomc meeting there has been a rise of about 35 to 40 basis points in yields from twoyear to thirty year maturities  the shift in expectations is reflected predominately in real interest rates  as can be seen in chart 4 breakeven inflation rates have not changed much since the last fomc meetingthe decline in breakeven rates that occurred early in the intermeeting period has been reversed more recently and so we are at or slightly above where we were at the december meeting  this upward shift in real rates appears to reflect a reassessment by market participants not only about the nearterm path of shortterm rates but also about what level of real shortterm rates is likely to prove sustainable over the medium and longer term the buoyancy of the recent activity data may have caused some market participants to reassess what level of the real federal funds rate is likely to prove neutral over the longer term
regarding the issue of risk appetite there appears to be no significant change since the last fomc meeting  risk appetite remains very strong  corporate credit spreads remain very tightespecially in the highyield sector as shown in chart 5 and implied volatilities across the broad market categoriesequities and interest rates see chart 6 and foreign exchange rates see chart 7remain unusually low
moreover the turbulence in some emerging debt and equity markets experienced

1  material used by mr dudley is appended to this transcript appendix 1
early this month was mostly transient and has subsided as well  so things appear calm  but what are the areas of greatest risk
in the united states the subprime mortgage market appears to be a particularly vulnerable sector  the vulnerability stems from four factors  first this market is relatively new and untested  chart 8 shows the overall trend of first residential mortgage originations and the share of these mortgages by typeconforming jumbo subprime and alta which is a quality category that sits above subprime but is not quite as good as conforming  as can be seen in this chart subprime mortgage originations have climbed in recent years even as overall originations have fallen  in 2006 subprime mortgages were 24 percent of total originations up from a share of about 10 percent in 2003  the second factor is that credit standards in this market appear to have loosened in 2006 with the proportion of interestonly loans and low documentation loans climbing as a share of the total  as a result there are some signs that strains in this market are increasing  as chart 9 shows delinquency rates have moved somewhat higher  in contrast chargeoffs remain low held down by the rapid house price appreciation that we saw in recent years  most noteworthy as shown in chart 10 the most recent 2006 vintage of subprime mortgages is showing a much more rapid rise in delinquencies than earlier vintages showed  the third factor is that most outstanding subprime mortgage loans have adjustable rates  there is significant reset risk given the rise in shortterm rates in 2005 and the first half of 2006 and the fact that many of these loans started with low teaser rates  fourth housing prices are under some pressure and this could contribute to further credit strains  i see some risk of a vicious cycle  if credit spreads in the securitized market spike because loan performance is poor a sharp downturn in lending could result as the capital market for securitized subprime mortgage products closes  this constriction of credit could put downward pressure on prices and lead to more credit problems among borrowers the result would be additional credit quality problems wider credit spreads and a further contraction of credit  fortunately to date the news is still fairly favorable
the strong demand for the credit derivatives obligations created from subprime mortgage products has restrained the rise in credit spreads  as can be seen in chart 11 spreads are still well below the peaks reached in late 2002 and early 2003  thus the economics of making such loans and securitizing them into the capital markets still work  but this situation could change very quickly especially if the labor markets were to become less buoyant and the performance of the underlying loans were to deteriorate leading to a surge in delinquencies and chargeoffs

let me now turn to the commodity markets  the issue i wish to examine here is whether some of the sharp movements in commodity prices that we have observed since the last fomc meeting represent shifts in the risk appetite among noncommercial investors who have put funds into commodities as a new asset class versus the contrasting view that these price movements predominantly represent changes in the underlying supply and demand fundamentals  to get a sense of this lets look briefly at three commodities that have moved the most and are representative of their classescopper corn and crude oil  as chart 12 shows the sharp decline in copper prices appears linked to the large rise in copper inventories at
the london metal exchange  if anything the price decline appears overdue  for corn the rise in prices also appears consistent with declining stocks both in the united states and globally see chart 13 as well as the growing demand anticipated for corn in the production of ethanol  for crude oil the decline in prices is more difficult to tie back to inventories  although us inventories remain high relative to the fiveyear historical average as shown in chart 14 this situation has persisted for some time without having a big effect on prices  instead the shift in oil prices appears to be driven mostly by longerterm forces  this can be seen in two ways
first as shown in chart 15 the change in oil prices has occurred in both spot and forward prices  the oil curve has shifted downward in mostly a parallel fashion which also calls into question the role of unseasonably warm weather as the primary driver  if weather were the primary factor then the decline in prices should have been reflected much more strongly in the spot and very shortend of the oil price curve  second as shown in chart 16 opec spare production capacity has been increasing and is expected to continue increasing in 2007  this growing safety margin reflects both slower growth in global demand and the expansion of nonopec output  the improved safety margin may be an important factor behind recent developments in the energy sector
finally there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the december fomc meeting
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for bill  president poole
mr poole  i was astonished when i saw the notei think it was in the wall street
journal a couple of weeks agothat oil consumption actually fell worldwide in 06 relative to
05 which really surprised me  i dont know quite how to explain that because the economies
around the world are pretty strong  im assuming that the longerrun price elasticities are taking
hold and that a lot of the traders probably believe the elasticity is zero and they pushed prices up
pretty high  does that make sense
mr dudley  i think that is definitely part of the story  another part of the story is
that in some countries especially emerging market countries the oil was heavily subsidized and
some of those subsidies are now coming off because continuing to subsidize as the oil price
climbs entails a rather heavy budgetary burden  so youre also seeing a sort of normalization of
oil prices in a lot of places  think about the oil that russia used to sell to eastern europe or
some of the surrounding countries at preferential prices  they are no longer getting those
preferential prices so there is a demand response  i think it is happening on both sides  there
has been a demand response to higher oil prices and there has been a supply response coming
out of places like africa
ms johnson  if i may add a footnotei think you also need to watch the pattern of
how inventories have behaved  when prices were being pushed up in the process from say the
end of 2003 to their various local peaks the incentive to hold inventories rose  at some point in
2006 inventories were very highwe had basically filled every bucket we could find with crude
oiland inventories feed back  its a dynamic  price changes create the demand for inventories
the realtime value of inventories feeds back on the price  so i think you saw some of that
going on as well in 2006 in terms of driving the price versus driving usage  purchase for
inventory is not well measured  we have inventories only for the oecd so separating
production from consumption is not perfect because we cant always capture the inventories and
they are measured as consumption in some cases
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  bill if you talk to the producers and the refinersyoull find out that i
like to do that kind of thingthere has been some concern although one cant measure it with
any precision that the socalled city refiners in london or on wall street meaning the
speculators do affect prices  we have had some discussions with your predecessor but im
curious as to what your views on that phenomenon are
mr dudley  as you know this topic is undergoing a lot of further research  the
academic literature that ive surveyed has yet to uncover a strong causal relationship between a
climb in speculative open interest and the effect on price  one reason that is hard to imagine
happening to a powerful degree in the end is that the speculators really dont want to take actual
delivery of the physical commodity and so the price really should clear in the spot market on
whats happening to underlying supply and demand  but this topic certainly remains under
investigation by a number of researchers  i dont think we have the definitive answer to the
question at this point
mr fisher  but were still working on it
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  bill could you or dave remind us what share of the
total outstanding stock of mortgages consists of subprimes or what share of the housing stock do
we think is financed at the subprime level  my recollection is that the share is still small even
though it has been a large part of the recent flows
mr dudley  its quite a bit smaller share of total outstanding because the average life
of the subprime mortgage loan im told is only two or three years  in other words if your credit
quality improves you will refinance out of your subprime mortgage into a higher quality
mortgage  so originations are 24 percent but the actual number of subprimes that are actually
outstanding is much lower
mr reinhart  we reported in yesterdays briefing that subprime borrowers
constituted only about 13 percent of all mortgages outstanding
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  ex post subprime mortgagebacked securities seem to have been
overvalued in the sense that they underestimated default risk for some market segments  so the
presumption would be that such information gets taken on board and reflected in the prices of
new mortgagebacked securities and that it would translate into higher credit spreads at the retail
level  in your remarks you seemed to suggest that there is a chance that this process of
adjustment might cause markets not to work  im wondering what you meant by that
mr dudley  its not that markets wont work  its just the economics of originating
subprime loans and selling them into the market would no longer work  in other words at some
point if the actual capital markets are not willing to accept those subprime mortgages at the right
price then the ability of the person to originate the mortgages and sell them into the market goes
away   now would this wreck the market  well it depends because some subprime originators
can carry these loans on their own books  but the industry is quite fragmented with a lot of
these issuers not having the ability to carry these subprime loans on their books  so that part of
the subprime origination market would go away  some of the monoline subprime originators
would be unable to exist if there werent a securitized demand for those assets
mr lacker  so quantities would go down
mr dudley  you could think of the situation as credit availability to that sector
diminishing which could have feedback effects on price  thats the risk
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  we need a vote to ratify
domestic operations
mr kohn  so moved
chairman bernanke  without objection  we turn now to the economic situation
mr slifman
mr slifman2  thank you mr chairman  ill wait for my colleagues to come to the table  well be using the chart package that you all should have on the economic outlook  separating the signal from the noise in the recent economic data has not been easywhat with the motor vehicle anomaly the defense spending pull forward and the transitory swings in oil imports  we tried to cut through the clutter by highlighting in the greenbook real private domestic final purchases or pdfp that is the sum of consumption residential investment and business fixed

2  material used by mr slifman mr wascher and mr gagnon is appended to this transcript appendix 2
investment  we think this aggregation which is shown on line 3 of the table in exhibit 1 currently is giving a fair representation of the thrust of aggregate demand the data that we have received since the december meeting have been stronger than expected  as a result we have revised up our estimates of the growth of pdfp in both the fourth and the first quarters to annual rates of about 2 percentroughly the same rates as those in the middle two quarters of 2006
the remaining panels of exhibit 1 highlight some of the indicators that have informed our judgment about the current pace of activity  starting with the labor market the middle left panel increases in private payroll employment averaged 119000 in the fourth quarter close to the average pace in the preceding two quarters as you may remember at the last fomc meeting we commented on the stronger signal for activity coming from the labor market compared with the spending data
that tension seems to have been largely resolved not because of weaker employment but because of stronger spendingespecially consumption  retail sales increased briskly in november and december accordingly in this greenbook we boosted our estimate of fourthquarter real pce growth the middle right panel to an annual rate of about 4 percent  the fundamentals for consumption remain quite solid  steady employment gains recent declines in energy prices that have raised real income well maintained consumer sentiment and further increases in stock market wealth  that said at least according to some of our models the fourthquarter pace of consumer spending was stronger than would have been consistent with those fundamentals
our forecast for the growth of real pce in the first quarter at 36 percent reflects a bet that some of the surprising fourthquarter strength will carry forward for a while turning to housing sales of new and existing homeswhich are not shown in the exhibitappear to have stabilized in recent months and the ratio of new home inventories to sales has moved down a bit  as shown in the bottom left panel the apparent stabilization of housing demand may now be starting to show through to permits and starts for singlefamily homes  of course the unusually warm weather in december makes a definitive assessment at this time particularly difficult  in the business sector investment spending slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter  in particular shipments of nondefense capital goods the red line in the panel to the right have been unexpectedly soft recently including the december figure that we received after publishing the greenbook  part of the recent weakness in this category appears to be for purchases of equipment related to construction and motor vehicle manufacturing  with orders remaining above shipments we expect real equipment spending to rise modestly in the first quarter

exhibit 2 takes a closer look at some recent developments starting with an examination of the effects on the industrial sector coming from the recent sharp declines in the production of light motor vehicles and residential investment  by our reckoning production of light motor vehicles the top left panel tumbled nearly
20 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter of 2006 and dropped further in the fourth quarter  meanwhile we estimate that residential investment shown to the right plunged at an annual rate of about 20 percent in both the third and the fourth quarters  in thinking about the effects of these developments on industrial
production we need to keep in mind the upstream effects  as noted in the bulleted items in the middle left panel the drop in production of light motor vehicles affects ip not only through its direct effect on light motor vehicle manufacturing but also indirectly through its influence on production in upstream industries such as primary metals tires and nowadays semiconductors  in the case of construction of course all the ip effect comes through the influence on upstream industrieslumber concrete plumbing fixtures and so forth  the table to the right shows the estimated effects on ip growth including upstream effects associated with the declines in the production of light motor vehicles and residential construction illustrated in the top panels  we have used inputoutput relationships to estimate the direct and upstream effects and then translated these effects into their ip contributions  lines 2 and 3 show that after we account for upstream influences motor vehicles and residential construction were sizable drags on ip in the third and fourth quarters  yet as shown in line 4 the drag from those two sectors was not the whole story  even so we think the more likely track from here forward involves modest growth rather than a cumulative weakening of industrial activity in part because we think that most producers have been moving reasonably promptly to address any emerging inventory problems
the bottom panels widen the scope from the industrial sector to the economy as a whole and address the question of whether developments in lesscyclical industries have been helping support economic activity  my colleague stephanie aaronson divided the establishment survey employment data into three categorieshighly cyclical industries moderately cyclical industries and acyclical industriesbased on the correlation of individual industry employment changes with the gdp gap  the bottom left panel presents some history with the highly cyclical grouping plotted by the black line and the moderately cyclical plotted in red  to keep the chart easier to read the acyclical group is not plotted  the chart shows what you might have expected ex ante  fluctuations in both series are highly correlated but the amplitude of swings in the moderately cyclical is more damped  the panel to the right puts a microscope on the past few yearsnote the change in scale  as you can see despite the stepdown of employment gains in the highly cyclical industries employment in the moderately cyclical industries has continued to grow apace  this suggests that the softness weve seen lately in residential construction and some parts of manufacturing has not spilled over to other parts of the economy
that conclusion is an important factor that has shaped our view about the longer run outlook for the economythe subject of exhibit 3  as shown in line 1 of the table in the top panel later this year the growth rate of real gdp is expected to move back up toward our estimate of the growth rate of potential and it stays there in 2008 this basic pattern is unchanged from the last greenbook  the bullets in the middle panel highlight some of the major forces shaping this projection  the most important is our forecast that the restraint from housing will diminish this year and that its contribution to gdp growth will turn slightly positive next year  second the recent declines in oil prices plotted in the bottom left panel have raised real income we believe that the drag from the earlier increases in oil prices should dissipate in the
near term and over time the stimulus from the recent price declines should begin to predominate  third federal fiscal policy the bottom right panel also is a bit stimulative although the impetus is projected to ebb over the next two years  finally given our conditioning factors the assumed path of the nominal federal funds rate is consistent with a real funds rate that closes the output gap over time
exhibit 4 focuses on the components of pdfp  as i noted earlier the levelingoff of home sales the uptrend in mortgage applications and the improvement in homebuying attitudes suggest that housing demand may be leveling off  the top panel shows the historical relationship between housing demand as measured here by sales of new homes the red line and housing construction shown here by single family housing starts the black line  the shaded areas highlight previous housing downturns as well as the current situation  as you can see cyclical recoveries in sales and starts have generally been fairly coincident historically  youll have to take my word for it but this has been the case even when the inventory of unsold homes has been high  accordingly we think that the recent stabilization of sales should be accompanied soon by a stabilization of starts  then as sales move up so should starts  the middle panels focus on the consumption forecast  we expect real pce the red bars in the left panel to increase 2 percent this year and next  the forecast reflects two main crosscurrents  on the one hand real income growth the blue bars is projected to be robust reflecting in part continued increases in real wages as well as further employment gains  on the other hand the wealthincome ratio plotted by the black line in the panel to the right falls in our forecast as house prices appreciate only about 1 percent per year  with slower gains in wealth and spending gradually coming back into line with fundamentals after the current period of unexplained strength the saving rate should rise
the bottom panels present some details on the outlook for business fixed investment  as illustrated in the bottom left panel total real outlays for equipment and software excluding the volatile transportation equipment component are projected to increase about 6 percent both this year and next  you can see from the red portion of the bars that the bulk of the support comes from spending for hightech equipment as telecommunications service providers further expand their fiber optic networks and as businesses continue to invest in information technology equipment and software  we expect the contribution from the other equipment category the blue portion to narrow this year and then to edge up in 2008 largely reflecting the pattern of changes in the growth of business output  the bottom right panel shows our forecast for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining  the incoming information on construction outlays for nonresidential buildings and the forwardlooking indicators that we monitor suggest that spending growth has downshifted  accordingly after rising 12 percent in 2006 real outlays for this component of nonresidential structures are expected to decelerate to a pace of 5 percent this year  our projection for 2008 brings growth in this component of nonresidential structures down to its longrun average  bill will now continue our presentation
mr wascher  the top panel of exhibit 5 summarizes our assumptions about the supply side of the economy  as indicated in line 1 we assume that potential output growth will edge down over the forecast period from 27 percent in 2006 to
25 percent in 2008  this slowing primarily reflects our assumptions about trend hours growth line 2 which steps down from about  percent last year to  percent in 2008 because of a steepening downward trend in the labor force participation rate and a gradual slowing of population growth  although we are comfortable with these assumptionsand indeed have not made any changes to them in this projection we do see risks on both sides of our point estimates  for example as shown in the middle left panel many outside forecasters are basing their projections on a significantly higher estimate of potential outputin some cases above 3 percent per year  we suspect that these differences at least in part reflect different views about the underlying trend in the labor force participation rate
the participation rate and our estimate of its trend are shown in the middle right panel  as indicated by the black line labor force participation has risen about
 percentage point since its trough in early 2005  some forecasters appear to have taken this increase as a signal of faster labor force growth going forward  however we see it as largely a cyclical response to steady employment growth and a tighter labor market and we expect it to be reversed in the near future as the pace of hiring slows and the underlying demographic forces show through  in part our view reflects the fact that the participation rate tends to rise above its trend when the unemployment rate is low  periods in which the unemployment rate was below the staffs estimate of the nairu are denoted by the yellow shaded areas in the chart and the current gap between the actual participation rate and our estimate of the trend does not appear to be outsized relative to historical norms  in addition as shown in the bottom left panel the increase in the participation rate over the past couple of years has been fueled by a rise in the percentage of individuals who moved directly from out of the labor force to a job this flow also exhibits noticeable sensitivity to labor market tightness  that said some groups have behaved differently than our models would have predicted  on the one hand the participation rate of older individuals shown by the red line in the bottom right panel has risen steadily for some time presenting an upside risk to our forecast  on the other hand participation among teenagers the black line has remained surprisingly low and there are undoubtedly downside risks to our forecast of an upturn for this segment of the population
exhibit 6 describes another source of tension in the recent data that may have implications for our estimate of potential output  as shown in the top left panel our standard okuns law simulation the red line suggests that the unemployment rate the black line fell more last year than would have been expected given our current estimate of real gdp growth in 2006  in the baseline forecast we assume that an increase in the unemployment rate causes that gap to disappear gradually an assumption that does not seem unreasonable given that the error in okuns law at the end of last year was within the bounds of historical experience  however other interpretations are possible as well  one possibility is that current estimates of real
gdp understate economic growth last year  one piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is shown in the top right panel  we currently estimate that real gross domestic income rose 4 percent in 2006 about  percentage point more than real gdp  as shown by the green line in the top left panel if we replace real gdp growth with our estimate of real gdi growth over the past year and rerun the okuns law simulation the actual unemployment rate in the fourth quarter lines up very closely with its simulated value
an alternative interpretation of the recent error in okuns law is that potential output growth was weaker last year than we have assumedperhaps because of a downshift in structural productivity growth  the middle and bottom panels address this possibility  as shown by the difference between actual productivity growth the black line in the middle left panel and a simulation from our standard model the red line labor productivity decelerated much more last year than the model would have expected  as shown in the panel to the right a purely statistical model based on a kalman filter would have responded to the incoming data since march of last year by cutting its estimate of structural productivity growth by a full percentage point  in contrast because we place less weight on the recent data that have not yet been through an annual revision we have reduced our own estimate by only 06 percentage point  the bottom panels provide a couple of reasons for our reluctance to lower our estimate of structural productivity growth as much as the statistical model would have lowered it  first as shown on the left labor productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector was quite strong last year  in part the better performance of productivity in this sector reflects the fact that its output is measured from the income side of the accounts and thus incorporates the difference between gdi and gdp noted above  in addition this component omits some sectors that are notoriously difficult to measure  second as shown on the right a measure of productivity that excludes the residential construction industry also held up fairly well last year suggesting that much of the deceleration in nonfarm business productivity may be cyclical  as shown in the middle panel all told we expect actual labor productivity growth to step back up to an annual rate of about 2 percent by the middle of this year as businesses reduce the pace of hiring in lagged response to the slower rate of output growth in recent quarters
the implications of this forecast for the labor market are shown in the top panels of exhibit 7  in particular gains in nonfarm payroll employmentshown by the black line in the top left panelare projected to slow to about 60000 per month by the second half of this year  this pace is somewhat below our estimate of trend employment growththe red line  as a result the unemployment rateshown in the top right paneldrifts up to just under 5 percent our estimate of the current level of the nairu  to help gauge whether the estimated gap between the unemployment rate and the nairu is sending an appropriate signal about the degree of tightness in the labor market i have included some other measures of slack in the remaining panels of this exhibit  as shown in the middle left panel the job openings rate from the blss jolts job openings and labor turnover survey rose over the second half of last year to its highest level since early 2001  because the job openings rate
has such a short history its equilibrium level is difficult to estimate  however we can learn something by combining the openings rate and the unemployment rate to form the beveridge curve shown to the right  the curve is estimated using data from the first quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2006 with the openings rate on the vertical axis and the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis  the relationship between job openings and unemployment appears to have been fairly stable in recent years which suggests that the nairu has not changed materially over that period
moreover the latest data point is in the far upper left portion of the graphthe segment of the curve indicative of a tight labor market  two other margins of slack are shown in the lower two panels  the bottom left shows the percentage of employed persons working part time because of slack work at their firm or because they couldnt find a fulltime job  this measure has moved down over the past couple of years and is currently below its average level in the second half of 1996 an earlier period when we thought that labor markets were roughly in equilibrium also as shown to the right the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing remains a little above its longrun average level
exhibit 8 presents the inflation outlook  despite our view that labor and product markets are tight other influences on our inflation projection have been more favorable than we were expecting at the time of the last greenbook  perhaps most notably the recent data on core consumer pricesshown in the top left panelhave been lower than expected  core pce prices were about unchanged in november and based on the latest cpi reading we expect an increase of only 02 percent in december  as a result as shown in the second column of the table we have marked down our estimate of core pce inflation in the fourth quarter by  percentage point to an annual rate of 21 percent  as shown in the top right panel the lower path of oil prices led us to revise down our projection of consumer energy prices  these lower prices directly pull down our forecast for total pce prices they also imply somewhat smaller indirect effects from energy costs on core prices over the forecast period  as shown in the middle left panel a higher exchange value of the dollar in this forecast led us to reduce the projected path of core nonfuel import prices  the combination of these various influences led us to shave our projection for core pce pricesline 4 of the middle right panelby 01 percentage point in both 2007 and 2008 to 22 percent and 20 percent respectively  as before the slight downward trajectory to core inflation reflects our projections of waning indirect effects of the earlier increases in energy and other commodity prices declining relative import prices and a deceleration in shelter costs
in light of my earlier discussion of the risks to our assumptions about potential output growth the bottom panels present one alternative simulation from the greenbook in which we assume both a higher trend for the labor force participation rate and slower growth in structural productivity  specifically we calibrated the simulation so that overall potential output growth was essentially the same as in the baseline forecast but with structural productivity growth  percentage point weaker and trend hours growth  percentage point stronger  as shown in the bottom left panel this change to the composition of potential output growth has little effect on
aggregate activity and the unemployment rate  however the implications for inflationthe middle panelare noticeable with core pce inflation moving up toward 2 percent next year because of the effects of lower structural productivity growth on trend unit labor costs  joe will now continue our presentation
mr gagnon  your first international exhibit exhibit 9 covers recent market developments  as shown by the green line in the top left panel oil prices dropped further this month bringing the west texas intermediate spot price back to pre katrina levels  the imf index of nonfuel commodity prices the red line was little changed this month after a year of remarkable increases  readings from futures markets imply a flattening out of nonfuel commodity prices and only a moderate increase in oil prices going forward  the top right panel shows that our real trade weighted dollar indexes declined on balance last year  in recent weeks the dollar rebounded modestly against the major industrialcountry currencies the red line but we estimate that it continued to decline in real terms against the currencies of our other important trading partners the green line  as usual our forecast calls for a small downward trend from current levels reflecting our belief that the risk of significant depreciation is slightly greater than the risk of significant appreciation owing to the unsustainably large us trade deficit  the bottom panels report equity market indexes with industrial countries shown on the left  the lines are set to equal 100 in march 2000 the previous peak month for the wilshire 5000  equity prices have risen broadly across the industrial countries over the past two years and are now just above their march 2000 levels in the united states the united kingdom and japan but not in the euro area the red line  for major emerging markets on the right equity indexes are well above march 2000 levels  in mexico the blue line equity prices have more than tripled over this period  in thailand the green line the governments recent attempts to slow capital inflows and relieve upward pressure on the currency have taken their toll on equity prices but contagion to other emerging equity markets has been minimal  overall commodity and financial market developments are consistent with expectations of strong global growth
exhibit 10 focuses on financial flows between emerging markets and industrial countries  as shown in the top left panel the major developing regions have continued the downward trend in their reliance on external borrowing  fiscal deficits have declined in most countries and many governments have turned increasingly to local rather than external borrowing  the panel to the right shows that yield spreads on dollardenominated sovereign debt of emerging market countries have dropped to historically low levels
but emerging markets in the aggregate have gone much further than just reducing their borrowing  in recent years emerging markets have experienced record outflows of official capital the gold bars in the middle panel  these official outflows are composed of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves the servicing and paying down of sovereign debt and the purchase of foreign assets by governmentrun investment funds such as the kuwait investment authority  in all the emerging market regions official capital outflows have recently exceeded current
account surpluses the blue bars which are themselves at record levels  for example the imf estimates that in 2006 governments in emerging asia invested on balance 270 billion outside their borders a sum that greatly exceeds their combined current account surplus of 185 billion  most of these official flows have taken the form of additions to foreign exchange reserves as governments have built up war chests against future financial crises and sought to counter upward pressures on their currencies
the bottom panel looks at these flows from the point of view of the industrial countries plotting aggregate emerging market net official flows the gold bars relative to industrialcountry gdp with negative values denoting net flows into the industrial countries  the statistical accounts do not report the destinations of all these flows but the available evidence suggests that the overwhelming majority is destined for the industrial countries  before 2003 net official inflows or outflows from the emerging markets had never exceeded 1 percent of industrialcountry gdp  but since 2003 things have changed  net official outflows from emerging markets are now estimated to equal 2 percent of the combined gdp of the industrial countries as shown in the panel the timing of this unprecedented increase in net official flows corresponds well with the puzzling decline in real shortterm interest rates in the industrial countries the green line that persisted long after industrialcountry gdp growth the purple line rebounded from the slowdown early in this decade  the evidence suggests that aggregate policydriven capital flows from the emerging markets may be an important factor behind low real interest rates in the industrial countries  moreover low real rates are not limited to shortmaturity instruments
the top panels of exhibit 11 show that tenyear indexed bond yields are also low and have been for several years in the major industrial countries  these rates have ticked up over the past month or two but only by a small amount  longterm inflation compensation shown in the middle row of panels remains contained
indeed in japan and canada the two panels on the right inflation compensation has moved down in recent months  in the euro area and the united kingdom the two panels on the left where inflation compensation lingers above policymakers targets we project modest additional policy tightening early this year shown in the bottom row of panels
despite recent and expected future inflation rates close to zero the bank of japan seems poised to tighten gradually over the next two years  in canada policy is expected to remain on hold  if these projections prove to be the peak policy rates for this cycle they will be the lowest cyclical peaks for shortterm interest rates in these countries for at least forty years  nevertheless we judge that these policy stances are likely to be consistent with low and stable inflation this year and next  the large capital inflows and low real interest rates in the industrial countries have contributed to rising housing prices in many of these countries  higher home prices in turn have stimulated housing construction  the top panel of exhibit 12 shows that the extent and timing of the houseprice boom differs markedly across countries  the netherlands the blue line was one of the leaders of the global housing boom with
prices rising continuously since the early 1990s though at much slower rates in recent years  japan the green line on the other hand is a notable exception to the trend of rising house prices in recent years reflecting the lingering effects of the bursting of the 1980s asset bubble and japans extended economic slump  the middle panels focus on two countries that experienced strong houseprice increases the purple lines early in this decade but where houseprice increases subsequently halted at least temporarily  in both australia and the united kingdom as in the united states residential investment the green lines responded positively to higher house prices
in australia on the left real house prices have been flat for the past three years and residential investment has declined gradually about 1 percentage point of gdp though it remains above its historical average  in the united kingdom on the right house prices stabilized in 2005 and picked up again modestly last year  despite lower houseprice inflation residential investment has continued to rise toward historically high levels  the relevance of these foreign experiences for the united states is difficult to gauge but they provide some support for larrys forecast that the downturn in us housing is nearly over
in light of the signals from financial and commodity markets as well as other realside indicators we project continued solid growth in the foreign economies at rates that are not likely to strain resources or to put upward pressure on inflation  as shown in the bottom panel total foreign growth line 1 is estimated to have stepped down last year from 4 percent in the first half to about 3 percent in the second half and it is projected to remain around 3 percent over the forecast period  this projection is about 1 percentage point stronger than the staffs projection for us growth shown at the bottom of the panel  the foreign industrial economies line 2 overall are projected to grow at about the same rate as the united states japan a bit slower line 4 and canada a bit faster line 5  the emerging market economies line 6 are projected to grow at nearly twice the pace of the industrial economies
over the forecast period  we expect that emerging asia line 7 will continue to grow very rapidly and that latin america line 8 will grow at a solid though not exceptional rate  our forecast assumes that the chinese government will take additional measures if necessary to reduce the growth rate of investment and we project that chinese gdp growth will be slower this year than last  but the risks to our growth forecast for china are probably greater on the upside
exhibit 13 provides an assessment of what all these foreign influences mean for the us economy  overall import prices the black line in the top left panel fell sharply last quarter and are projected to continue to fall in the current quarter primarily owing to the drop in the price of imported oil  as oil prices stop falling and begin to move gradually back up overall import price inflation should turn positive prices of imported core goods the red line which exclude oil gas computers and semiconductors rose at a rate of nearly 4 percent in the middle of last year primarily owing to sharply higher prices of nonfuel commodities  with commodity prices projected to stabilize and with only a small depreciation of the dollar in our forecast prices of imported core goods should increase at a subdued pace over the next two years
the contributions of exports and imports to us gdp growth are shown in the lower panel  we now estimate that the external sector made a positive arithmetic contribution to growth last year the first positive annual contribution since 1995 import growth stepped down from previous years as us gdp grew more slowly export growth benefited from robust foreign economic activity but exports turned out even stronger than our models project  line 1 in the top right panel shows that for the first eleven months of last year at an annual rate exports of goods grew
10 percent from the previous year in real terms  lines 2 through 4 show that three categories of capital goodsaircraft machinery and semiconductorscontributed nearly half of total export growth  although it is possible that blistering growth rates in exports of these goods may continue we base our forecast on a return of export growth to a rate more consistent with historical relationships  with the vast majority of aircraft production being exported in recent months and with aircraft factories running at high utilization rates further large increases in exports from this sector at least do not seem likely
returning to the bottom panel we project that the negative arithmetic contribution of imports the red bars to gdp growth will outweigh the export contribution the blue bars in 2007 and 2008 by about  percentage point the black line  this projection is driven by the historical tendency of us imports to grow at a much faster rate than us gdp  in addition the larger value of imports relative to exports means that even if imports and exports were to grow at the same rate the negative contribution of imports would be greater than the positive contribution of exports
the projected strong growth rates of foreign gdp discussed in your previous exhibit are not large enough to outweigh these factors over the next two years  on balance relative prices have little effect on net exports over the forecast period as the real tradeweighted dollar has moved in a relatively narrow range over the past couple years and is not projected to move substantially over the forecast period  and now larry will complete our presentation
mr slifman  the final exhibit presents your forecasts for 2007 and 2008  ill be mercifully brief  the central tendency shows real gdp increasing 2 to 3 percent this year and roughly the same next year with the unemployment rate holding in the range of 4 to 4 percent during both years  the central tendency of your projections sees the core inflation rate falling  percentage point over the next two years  that concludes our prepared remarks mr chairman  ill be happy to take your questions
chairman bernanke  thank you  that was very interesting  i have a couple of
questions about your counterfactuals  in exhibit 6 you look at the simulated rate of
unemployment assuming that gross domestic income is the true measure of output and you find
that unemployment fits okuns law  but then below you also use gdi to measure productivity
youre not doing the same thing in both simulations right  if you assume that gdi measures
output and use it to calculate both okuns law and productivity i think the puzzle comes back  i
think you just increased potential output and youre back to where you started
mr wascher  thats right  the potential output measures are based on a gdp
concept and productivity in the nonfarm business sector is the measure of structural productivity
that were using for potential gdp  the upper panel is just to illustrate what might happen if for
example the real gdp numbers for last year were revised up to show the same growth rate that
gdi shows now
chairman bernanke  okay  the other question is about exhibit 8 where you
consider a simulation with a decline in productivity and an increase in labor participation and
you get a higher rate of core inflation  in that simulation the decrease in productivity and the
increase in participation offset each other on both the aggregate demand side and the aggregate
supply side and the result is of course that the unemployment rate doesnt change so that
demandsupply balance is unchanged  i assume the reason you get inflation is that nominal
wages are sticky and therefore as productivity slows labor costs go up and firms can push them
through  i guess i would question whether thats realistic for two reasons  one is that this
increase in unit labor costs is clearly temporary and i think we tend to believe that longer
increases are needed to affect pricing  the other reason is that with the demandsupply balance
unchanged why would firms be able to pass through those costs in this scenario when they
couldnt raise prices absent that increase in unit labor costs
mr wascher  well real wages wouldnt be different but the adjustment could come
either through flexible nominal wages or faster increases in prices  in the frbus model which
is used to generate these simulations trend unit labor costs do cause an increase in the rate of
price inflation which is what you see here and that helps equilibrate the labor market
mr stockton  for a given level of resource utilization youre getting more cost
pressures and youre getting more upward pressure on prices  so its not a matter of their
absorbing all of it in their profit margins when theyve got that increase in costs  youre
absolutely right  in our basic framework we dont think that actual yeartoyear unit labor costs
influence overall price setting  it is in some sense a trend unit labor cost measure and that
actually was incorporated in frbus through a moving average or a set of lags  so there is still
some upward pressure on trend unit labor costs coming about through the slower productivity
growth some of which in essence would be perceived to be lower trend productivity
chairman bernanke  you also have to assume that the fed accommodates with
increased nominal gdp growth as well
mr stockton  correct
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there other questions for our colleagues
president fisher
mr fisher  just to follow up on your point and go to exhibit 12 about foreign gdp
growth rates which joe talked about  in terms of any pressures on unit labor costs that you see
developing i didnt quite catch your statement or i may have misinterpreted it but basically i
thought i heard that these growth rates are not likely to lead the inflationary pressures
mr gagnon  thats correct
mr fisher  so i would be curious as to what your observation is in terms of trend unit
labor costs in our important trading partners
mr gagnon  actually im not sure of the answer about unit labor costs per se but
these growth rates are close to what we think these countries can sustain without exceeding their
capacity limit
mr fisher  so its a gap analysis
mr gagnon  they are close to what we think their potential rates are and they dont
seem to be above or below their potential rates by very much in the aggregate  there are a few
exceptions of courseargentina perhaps and venezuela
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  i want to see if i understood something you said that pertained to exhibit
13  i think you said that us exports were stronger than expectedstronger than the models
would have predicted in 06even though growth abroad turned out to be quite strong  is that
right
mr gagnon  yes
mr stern  by about what order of magnitude  im just trying to determine whether
this was really significant or were talking about a tenth or two
mr gagnon  well the export contribution to gdp growth last year was about
 percent and i would have to check but im guessing that it might have still been zero if we
hadnt had this surprise  it would have been close to zero  i can check on that
mr stern  well you can let me know later
mr kohn  may i follow up on that
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  on the same chart joe i was wondering whether there is any evidence that
the foreign demand for our exports that elasticity is coming into closer alignment with our
demand for imports  that difference has really been driving the trade imbalance and i was
looking for little clues that this wasnt all special factors that maybe theyre catching up to us in
their appetites for imports
mr gagnon  this topic is actually close to my heart in terms of research and i wish
i could say it was so and maybe it will be so  laughter  i thought it was so around 2000 when
we had really strong exports we couldnt explain and then it all went away with the recession of
200102 and its only now coming back  but i looked at a lot of other countries and it does
seem that you can explain these differences between export and import elasticities based on
potential growth rates  the one country that seems to fit the worst is the united states and i
have never understood why the most important country is the one that doesnt fit  i wont go
into details but there are theoretical reasons to believe that indeed you shouldnt expect such
elasticities to be structurally different
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  i have two questions  the first is about our inflation
forecast  weve discussed several times the basic question about whether the nowprevailing
level of longterm inflation expectations in markets is likely to provide support for forecasts of
further moderation or likely to constrain the prospects for further moderation in core inflation
my recollection of that discussion although a little hazy is that expectations might be a bit of a
constraint  am i right in my recollection  has your view on that changed
mr stockton  well your recollection is correct i think  that was probably just a
hazy answer not a hazy memory on your part  in some sense our basic view is that getting to
2 percent is the gravitational constant that we currently see  we havent really seen any evidence
to suggest any significant shift in that view in recent months  something below that number on
a sustained basis is harder for us to see  in some sense implicit in this forecast is that at the end
of 2008 and into an extended greenbook forecast we get 2 percent without creating an output
gap that would actually drag things down further  then the question is how quick the dynamics
might be to take you to 2 percent  the view in our forecast is that the movement would be slow
over the next two years  but one could imagine a faster adjustment especially if it were aided by
a stronger dollar and by weaker oil prices  so there are reasons for thinking that the adjustment
would be faster but its also possible that some of the recent incoming data have given us a bit of
a head fake  maybe were not quite as far along in the process of getting back to 2 percent and
maybe were too optimistic in that regard
vice chairman geithner  this is a different question for joe  your exhibit 10
describes broad trends in net official capital flows from emerging markets to the united states and
global real interest rates  has your view about the relationship between them changed  i thought
we had sort of the conventional view  the accepted view within the system was a little skeptical
that there was much of an effect and i didnt think the research that looked at the relationship
between these two things suggested that the effect was that large  has your view about that
changed or is this exhibit consistent with it
mr gagnon  the relationship between the official flows and the current account
surpluses
vice chairman geithner  no between official flows and globalreally industrial
countryreal interest rates
mr gagnon  people often talk about chinas reserve accumulation affecting us
interest rates but they are only two countries in a big world and you may think that the united
states europe and japan have relatively open financial markets with a lot of mobility  if you look
at all the industrial countries together and the flows to all of them together however maybe theres
less mobility between the industrial countries as a group and the emerging markets as a group  that
might be more believable  thatalong with the fact that these flows are big even when you
distribute them over all the industrial countriesis what makes me think that there may be an
effect  that may raise a doubt in your mind  its not just to the united states or just to europe it is
in the aggregate
to answer president stern it looks to meand ill double check with our expertsas
though according to our forecast our model would have predicted negative real net exports last
year  so all the growth is a surprise
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  just to clarify the responseoverpredicted what
mr gagnon  the positive contribution from net exports last year about  percentage
point is entirely a surprise  in fact it would have been negative if i am reading our model
correctly
ms minehan  so it was an upward surprise in terms of what your model would have
predicted
mr gagnon  yes
ms minehan  im interested in the risks you see around the gdp growth rate in your
forecast  i note a couple of things  first some of the growth rate depends upon consumers getting
the message that they really ought to be saving for the future instead of spending as they have been
i wonder why theyd do that this year if they didnt do it last year  second i notice that if you
compare the greenbook gdp forecast with the central tendency of the members of the committee
growth is a good deal slower03 or 04 slower which in this realm is a lot  im interested in how
you see the upside risk to this particularly given that even with your slower growth rate you get to
zero output gap relatively quickly
mr slifman  let me first comment specifically on our consumption forecast and the
larger question that we raised  dave may want to add some comments  with regard to our
consumption forecast as i had mentioned and as we suggested by the alternative simulation that we
showed in part 1 of the greenbook clearly the unexplained strength that weve been seeing in
consumption spending in the second third and fourth quarters is an upside risk to the forecast
weve carried some of that through into 2007 as we noted in the greenbook and i noted in my
briefing and we think that it will eventually correct  we base that forecast just on the historical
patterns in the data  in the past when spending had gotten out of line with what we think of as being
the fundamentals for consumption it eventually corrected over time  there are a couple of
possibilities  one is that weve got the timing wrong and that the correction is going to take longer
in which case there would be more consumption  another possibilityand this goes back to the
point bill madeis that we could be wrong with regard to income growth  that might be revised
up and we will find that a lot more income growth is out there  now taking our forecast rather
than the alternative simulations at face valueyes we are slower than the fomc  i suspect that
part of the reason may be that the staff has a lower estimate of potential output growth than most
members of the committee probably have in their minds we cant know for sure but i suspect that
it probably goes a good way toward explaining the difference
ms minehan  youve got seven alternative scenarios there if i recall correctly
mr slifman  we were busy
ms minehan  yes you were  all kudos to you guys  four of the simulations have
slower gdp higher unemployment and a lower fed funds rate  in a couple of cases you had even
in the context of slower growth and higher unemployment somewhat higher inflation  then you
have three or so that show stronger paths  im wondering do you weight these alternative scenarios
equally  you know how dri dri is the wrong name now but i mean the successor company
does it  they give their baseline forecast a certain rate of probability and then they give alternative
rates of probability to the various scenarios  do you have a sense of that  would you weight the
stronger consumption scenario somewhat higher than the rest or no
mr slifman  i dont think so  personally i could think of equally plausible reasons that
we could get stronger aggregate demand growth or somewhat weaker aggregate demand growth
over the next year  we highlighted one possibility in the greenbook with regard to the weaker
investment scenario  another could be the housing forecast  housing could turn out to be weaker
than were forecasting  so on the aggregate demand side id give them equal weighting  with
regard to the aggregate supply side i suspect there too the weighting probably is equal  its a little
harder for me to judge  i dont know whether bill wants to add something
mr wascher  i think thats probably right
mr stockton  at the time of the last fomc meeting we were feeling as though the
incoming spending data were coming in pretty darn close to our expectations and were pretty
consistent with our story about entering a period of belowtrend growth  as we noted and
president moskow quizzed us about the big fly in the ointment with respect to our story was the
labor market and its ongoing strength  since then as larry noted the spending data have moved
toward the labor market data rather than the labor market data moving toward the spending data
the developments have certainly brought into sharper focus the upside risk associated with buoyant
consumer spending  if we made an important policymagnitude type error it might be that the third
quarter was just a period of low measured gdp growth but basically we havent moved much
below trend  i think that you would need to take that risk very seriously as you thought about the
current setting of policy
there are some critical reasons for remaining patient about whether in fact we have or have
not moved below trend  i think that we still havent seen the full effects of the housing shock that
we had in the second half of 2006  i suspect that we are going to see more of the employment
effects associated with that going forward  i dont think that weve seen the full multiplier
accelerator effects of that and we certainly havent seen if our estimated econometric models are
anywhere close to right the lagged effects of the slowing house prices and consumer wealth that we
think will be part of the reason for motivating a higher saving rate  so weve raised the forecast
and weve raised it significantly but i dont think were yet surrendering the notion that this current
setting of policy can produce a period of modestly below trend growth  now i think that the upside
risk continues to be the labor market strength
as larry said even given the overall dimensions of the housing shock weve been
encouraged about our story of stabilization  but i remember that as we went into the investment
shock earlier in this decade we just didnt have enough imagination about how bad things could
get and we kept thinking that we were seeing signs of slowing or stabilization that the new
technology was still great and that there should be reasons or underlying motivation for investment
perhaps what weve seen recently as stabilization are the beneficial effects of the drop in longterm
interest rates that occurred from last summer into the fall and pulled some people forward but really
we may not have fully made the adjustment yet  the overhang of unsold homes out there is very
large and we could be underestimating the size and duration of that  so even given the recent
stronger data on spending i still dont see all the risks on that side of things  i still think there are
some significant downside risks that you ought to be at least concerned about
ms minehan  thank you
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i just want to follow up on vice chairman
geithners first questionon inflation  it seems to me that most of the factors that are leading to
lower inflation in this forecast period are temporaryenergy prices owners equivalent rent and
import prices  the longerterm factors are the pressures in the labor market that weve talked about
and maybe some followthrough from the earlier accommodative financial conditions that weve
had  as you said chart 6 of the bluebook when you look past the forecast period doesnt show
inflation coming down  inflation actually goes up a bit with both the 1 percent target and the
2 percent target  doesnt this mean that expectations have moved up a bit when you see inflation go
up in 09 and beyond
mr stockton  many of the factors that youre citing as temporary on the downside
regarding inflation we see as having been temporary on the upside regarding inflation as well  the
higher energy prices and the pickup in import commodity prices were some factors explaining how
we got above 2 percent and their dissipation is principally the reason that we go back to 2  now
for the extended greenbook scenario that we show in the bluebook one reason for the upward
pressure on inflation beyond the near term is that part of the construction of that forecast is an
assumed 3 percent depreciation of the dollar that has to go on almost forever  so we have built in
some upward pressure on inflation  we have to do that in the model simply to begin making some
progress on the external balance  whether that happens in 2009 in 2015 or tomorrow would be
hard to say but it is one reason that the pickup is not principally the dissipation of the temporarily
good factors  its really more of that builtin dollardepreciation effect
mr moskow  so thats a key variable
mr stockton  to go back to what i said to the vice chairman implicit in that long
run scenario is a 2 percent inflation expectation that is sort of pegging inflation  obviously we
could be seriously wrong about that  we could also be seriously wrong about the degree of resource
utilization in the economy right now  that 2 percent comes about because we dont have a big
positive or negative output gap either now or going forward  if the nairu is more like 4 percent
then you might in fact make some progress in longrun inflation expectations  if the economy
slows you push the unemployment rate to 5 percent and you get a bit of output gap then you might
get some good behavior there  another issue with which i know youve been grappling is that
headline inflation has been high in recent years  if that condition were to persist it could lead to
some deterioration in inflation expectations that might raise us from 2 to something above 2 going
forward  we havent seen the evidence of that in measures of inflation expectations either from
surveys or from financial markets but thats something were watching to see whether or not our
story is right
mr moskow  thank you
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you  i have a question that is related to this issue but it comes out
of the bluebook  i think i understand how this model is working but then i get a surprise and i
realize i really dont understand how it works  i noticed in the bluebook that there was a jump of
50 basis points in the greenbookconsistent estimate of the real funds rate  at the same time in the
model and the simulations you keep the fed funds rate constant which would be slightly below
what that greenbook real rate might suggest  the unemployment rate remains somewhat below
your nairu estimate and yet you still have inflation modestly declining  im trying to figure out
how that works  is there something that im not understanding or can you clarify the mechanism
by which those things fit together
mr stockton  well i can speak to the greenbookconsistent measure and perhaps
vincent will want to talk a bit about the simulations of the bluebook  one thing that you have to
keep in mind is that the greenbookconsistent measure of r is the level of a real interest rate that
would be required for the output gap to return to zero in twelve quarters  in some sense given that
is whats built into the greenbook forecast the current level of the real interest rate is delivering that
particular outcome  its not that we have those longerrun estimates of r which are in essence
the monetary policy that is assumed to return the economy to equilibrium over the next three years
and then beyond that to stabilize the economy  thats a different construction  the greenbook
consistent r is answering a very specific question that is of limited value  those longerrun
simulations give you a clearer picture of where we think real interest rates would have to be to
equilibrate the economy over the longer haul not just over the short run
mr reinhart  the 05 percentage point increase in the greenbookconsistent r is
really due to a collection of factors  in the model the estimated bond premiums come down a little
and the equity premium came down over the intermeeting period  that just means you need a
higher real interest rate to get the same level of policy restraint  also they take the model and force
in the errors to get the greenbook simulation  effectively the model is less enthusiastic about the
economy than the greenbook and so the model errors tend to raise r  as to why inflation is
coming down we do have the lagged effects of the drop in energy prices inflation expectations are
contained and the output gap is closing
chairman bernanke  other questions  president lacker
mr lacker  ill follow up on the question of vice chairman geithner and president
moskow about the gravitational point of 20 percent  i remember asking you about the nairu and
getting a response that suggested i should think of a cloud of probabilities surrounding that estimate
im essentially asking you for your characterization of the cloud you have in your mind around the
idea that 2 percent is the number to which core inflation is going to have some gravitational pull
what comes to mind here is that vince told us several meetings ago that 2 to 2 on core pce
inflation was the range that he thought expectations were lying in and tips numbers and survey
numbers havent come down much since then as i recall  i am also interested in your commentary
on the kind of technical adjustment factor that traverses the cpi which the tips are based on and
the core  when you plot that it moves around a lot  so im wondering whether you have sharp
views about that going forward or how youd characterize your uncertainty about that factor in
helping us understand what the tips spreads imply about gravitational points
mr stockton  im not sure i have an empirically based response  we can actually
estimate from the model a confidence interval around a parameter estimate of the nairu which as
i indicated is wide but i dont have a similar thing for inflation expectations  however i would
argue that if you just look at the confidence intervals around inflation forecasts over the longer
haul they are pretty wide  obviously you control inflation over the longer haul  if you would tell
me what your tolerance is for five years from now given our ability on a yeartoyear basis to
forecast inflation plus or minus 1 percentage point actual inflation would fall plus or minus 1
percentage point around whatever you tell me your longerrun inflation objective would be  in
terms of the measures that we look atand i think those probably have not changed much since
vincent presented them in the bluebook a while back05 percentage point is just on the difference
in the measures alone it is not actually a measure of uncertainty around any individual measure  so
its wide  i dont know if you would want to add a confidence interval around that
mr reinhart  the intervals are no doubt wide  in the materials we sent to you in
october when you were talking about your inflation goal a staff memorandum looked at the gap
between the cpi and the pce price index  from 1994 to 2004 the minimum is minus 02 and the
maximum is 12  they do move around  we found in the regressions that we reported in the
bluebook box that theyre not very precise at all  the standard errors were quite large  so i think
the answer is that we dont have a measure of inflation expectations that we could put much
confidence in
chairman bernanke  seeing that there are no further questions i propose that we
start the economic goround  remember we do have the twohanded option if anyone cares to
exercise it  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  recent data on economic activity have been
loaded with upside surprises for most spending categories and also for labor markets  our response
like the greenbook has been to boost our estimate of growth last quarter and our forecast for
growth this quarter  for 2007 as a whole we have revised up our projection for real gdp growth
about  percentage point to about 2 percent which is just a bit below our estimate of the trend
which is a bit higher than the greenbook  this performance continues to reflect the socalled
bimodal economy with weakness in housing and autos coupled with strength almost everywhere
else
looking beyond the first quarter we interpret recent data as suggesting that the drag from
both weak sectors is likely to diminish providing impetus for an acceleration of activity later this
year  even so the greenbook forecasts and we agree that other factors will likely offset this
acceleration so that gdp will grow slightly below trend in 2007  in particular the greenbook
hypothesizes that the growth of consumer spending will slow with the saving rate rising from
minus  percent at the end of last year to plus 1 percent at the end of next year  this forecast
strikes us as quite reasonable  houseprice appreciation has slowed dramatically and the impetus it
has given consumption should diminish over time  in addition the greenbook notes and larry
emphasized that consumer spending has grown more rapidly than fundamentals can explain and
its sensible to predict some unwinding of this pattern  such an outcome however would represent
a noticeable change in the trend of the saving rate  so to me the possibility that the saving rate will
not in fact rebound to the extent anticipated in the greenbook constitutes a serious upside risk to
the outlook  of course the staff has emphasized this
an alternative simulation in the greenbook illustrates that if spending instead advances in
line with income the unemployment rate would decline noticeably further from a level that is
already low  it is precisely because we are starting from a situation in which labor markets are
already arguably tight that the upward revisions to growth during the intermeeting period
particularly concern me  some period of belowtrend growth may ultimately be necessary to
address inflationary pressures emanating from the labor market
in december i emphasized the puzzle presented by the combination of an apparently
sluggish economy and a robust job market  upward revisions to estimated growth in the fourth and
first quarters resolve a portion of that discrepancy  even so okuns law still suggests that the
excess demand in labor markets as reflected in the low unemployment rate is abnormally large
relative to that in goods markets as reflected in estimates of the output gap  the current low
unemployment rate may turn out to have benign implications for inflation  for example labor
market tightness may well diminish somewhat over time given that the lags between output growth
and labor market adjustments can be quite variable  another benign possibility is that the
unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets  for example some
indicators of labor market conditions like the conference board index for job market perceptions
suggest a bit of softening  indeed available indexes of labor compensation do not provide
compelling evidence of cost pressures emanating from the labor market  however compensation
data are mixed and i must admit that the signal from them is somewhat confusing
while i remain concerned about the risk that labor market pressures could boost inflation
over time im still fairly optimistic about the outlook for inflation overall  core inflation has come
down in recent months which is welcome although we must be careful not to overreact  recent
favorable data could reflect the dissipation of pressures from energy prices and owners equivalent
rent these sources of disinflation are inherently transitory and once they are fully worked through
the system we will be left with the influence of moreenduring factors such as the extent of excess
demand or supply in labor and product markets  if these markets are in fact unduly tight we could
eventually see rising inflation  inflation expectations also matter for the inflation outlook and i see
the stability of inflation expectations as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis  as i
previously mentioned my staff and other researchers find some evidence that inflation has become
less persistent over the past decade a period during which inflation and inflation expectations have
been low and stable  both survey and marketbased estimates suggest that longerterm inflation
expectations remain stable and well anchored
so to sum up i continue to view a soft landing with moderating inflation as my bestguess
forecast conditional on maintaining the current stance of policy  we expect core pce price
inflation to edge down from 2 percent last year to about 2 percent in 2007  while there are risks
on both sides of the outlook for growth im a little more focused on the upside risks after the recent
spate of strong data  its encouraging that the recent inflation news has been good  however
theres a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward and to me these risks remain biased
to the high side
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you  mr chairman some of my colleagues have told me they
expected me to brag today because both teams in the super bowl are from the seventh federal
reserve district but i assured them i would not do that  laughter
chairman bernanke  i notice that theyre not playing in the seventh federal
reserve district though  laughter
mr moskow   some day well have the super bowl at the seventh federal reserve
district  but turning to the business at hand business activity in our district continues to expand at
a somewhat modest pace but the tone of my business contacts was more positive than at our last
meeting  manufacturing activity in the district is currently a bit soft  the chicago purchasing
managers index fell from 516 in december to 488 in january and this number will be released
tomorrow morning
many of my contacts are expecting a significant pickup in activity in the second half of the
year  we heard this from manufacturers of building materials agricultural equipment construction
machinery autos and steel temporaryhelp firms and even from several retailers  though a
number of manufacturers thought that the recent softness was temporary and reflected the need to
work off some modest inventory buildups they said the final demand for their products remains
solid  the steel industry is a good example of this kind of dynamic  industry production has fallen
sharply since the summer but when i recently talked to the head of a major steel company he noted
that demand from end users had remained quite stable and he expected it to stay that way  the
production cutbacks were mainly the result of inventory fluctuations at the service centers which
buy bulk quantities of steel to process and distribute to final customers  the analysts in the industry
are divided on when this inventory correction will be complete but even the pessimists think that it
will be done by late spring  with the steady demand from enduse customers my contact thought
that production and prices would definitely be rising by the second half of the year  there was an
article in the paper today that mentioned that nucor is trying to raise prices by 20 a ton in march
my auto contacts had mixed views about 2007  last year was especially tough for the big three
high gas prices shifted sales from suvs to cars and then the mix of sales shifted from retail toward
fleet sales where their margins are lower  gm thought that gas prices probably have fallen enough
to stabilize the market share of light trucks and that retail sales were now down near their longterm
trend levels  ford was not as sanguine about either of these developments  finally the strength of
foreign demand and the weaker dollar seem to be showing through to increased export demand for a
number of our districts manufacturers and this situation supports the comments in the chart show
the national economy is clearly showing more underlying strength than we thought in
december  moreover the downsiderisk scenarios now seem less likely  the housing markets look
to be nearing the bottom and the spillover to other sectors now seems likely to be minor or is being
offset by other positive factors  importantly tight labor markets and lower energy prices are
boosting consumer spending  we continue to expect that growth will be modestly below potential
in the first half of the year but like my business contacts we expect activity to pick up in the second
half and growth to be a touch above potential by 2008  unlike the greenbook this projection is
conditioned on market expectations for interest rates which impart some degree of accommodation
next year  so currently i see the risks to the growth forecast as being fairly well balanced  on the
downside we could be wrong about the stabilization in housing and on the upside consumer
spending could remain robust or demand from abroad could accelerate
overall the recent data on inflation have been positive  as a result the forecasts from our
inflation models are lower by a tenth or two  the models estimated using data only since 1984
predict that core pce inflation will be flat at 23 percent through 2008  so im less optimistic about
inflation than the greenbook  in my mind there are two key questions concerning the inflation
outlook  first what happens in 2009 and beyond  as we were discussing before in chart 6 in the
bluebook for whatever reason inflation is moving up and i think thats a concern  second theres
the issue of longerrun inflation expectations  in the greenbook forecast by the end of 07 inflation
would have been at or above 2 percent for a year and a half with no change in the fed funds rate
and a reasonably strong economic environment  i think markets might interpret this inaction as a
signal that were satisfied with 2 percent inflation not the 1 percent to 2 percent comfort zone that
many of us have said we prefer  this view was shared by the participants at our recent gathering of
academic and business economistswe have an advisory committee that meets a few times a year
indeed several academics thought we were already at this point  in their minds the current policy
stance and inflation picture revealed that we were satisfied with inflation stabilizing at or a bit above
2 percent  the business economists also were predicting that we would find ourselves in the
position of needing to increase rates some time this year in order to put inflation on a pronounced
downward path
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  trends evident in the district economy for some
time fundamentally are continuing  specifically employment is increasing moderately and steadily
most components of aggregate demand are expanding and i would note in particular strength in
nonresidential construction  there has been no significant acceleration of inflationary pressures or
of wage pressures  the housing sector is subdued but the district data on sales and starts suggest
stabilization as do the national data  the data on the inventory of unsold homes perhaps are
contradictory to that statement because there are still a lot of unsold properties at least those data
suggest that it will be some time before there is any pickup in housing activity  in any event as bill
dudley mentioned mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are rising albeit starting from a fairly
low level and though that probably wont have a significant effect on economic performance it
could be a political issue in minnesota and elsewhere in the district
as far as the national economy is concerned it seems to me that the incoming data over the
past several months underscore a couple of things  first the data demonstrate again the underlying
resilience of the economy  second they bolster the case for sustained growth over the next year or
more accompanied by steady to diminishing core inflation  let me elaborate briefly on those
observations  the economy apparently grew better than 3 percent in real terms again last year
despite the significant runup in energy prices the appreciable decline in housing activity and
problems in the domestic auto industry  as i think about the prospects for 07 i see little in the
broad scheme of things to suggest that overall real growth over the next year will be much different
from that over the past year or for that matter much different from that experience from 03
through 05  it also seems to me that our earlier concerns about the possibility of a further
acceleration of core inflation have diminished largely on the basis of the incoming information on
inflation thereby through the process of elimination heightening the outlook for steady to declining
core inflation  i actually think that case is pretty good partly because some of the factors that
boosted core inflation were transitory and partly because inflation expectations as best i can judge
have remained well anchored  thats the message i get at least from financial markets from labor
markets and from conversations with our directors other business people and so forth  so for me
overall the nearterm to mediumterm outlook both for real growth and for inflation is constructive
ill stop there
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much mr chairman  the new england regional
economy continues to grow at a moderate pace with relatively slow job growth low unemployment
and moderating measured price trends  consumer and business confidence is solid and while retail
contacts reported an uneven holiday season manufacturers were generally upbeat about business
prospects  skilled labor continues to be in short supply and expensive  in every one of the new
england states there is concern over the longrun prospects for labor force growth given their
mutual low rates of natural increase outmigration of 25 to 34 year olds and dependence on
immigration for labor force growth  new england is an expensive place in which to live and
concerns abound about how to attract and retain the highly skilled workers that are needed for its
high preponderance of high value added industries  obviously theres nothing new or particularly
cyclical about the foregoing comments  but ive been to quite a few beginning of the year lets
take stock of things conferences in all the states recently so perhaps ive become more impressed
than usual by the mediumterm to longterm challenges facing the region  in the short run
however the positive overall trend of the regional economy does seem to be a powerful offset to the
continuing decline in real estate markets  at our last meeting it seemed as though new englands
real estate problem was more significant than that in the rest of the country  but now it appears that
both are similarly affected whether one looks at prices sale volumes inventory growth or declining
construction  as with the nation as a whole there are signs of stabilization but at least in new
england making any judgment about the imminent revival of real estate markets in midwinter is
foolhardy at best
on the national scene the data have been more upbeat since our last meeting  apparently
the holiday season was a bright one with consumption likely growing at a pace of more than
4 percent in the last quarter  thats remarkably strong given the continuing decline in residential
real estate and proofto reiterate what president stern saidthat the us economy continues to be
unusually resilient  supporting consumption are tight labor markets lower energy prices tighter
though still reasonably accommodative financial conditions strong corporate profits and some signs
of revival in business spending after declines related to housing and motor vehicle expenditures and
continuing strong foreign growth  even inflation has moderated a bit with threemonth core price
increases in both the pce and the cpi trending down  our forecast in boston and that of the
greenbook are virtually indistinguishable  the last quarter of 06 was stronger than expected  the
first quarter of this year will be slightly better as well but after that the trajectory remains the same
as it has been for the past two or three meetings  an increasing pace of growth in 07 and 08 as the
housing and motor vehicle situations unwind a slight rise in unemployment and a fall in core pce
inflation to nearly 2 percent by the end of the forecast period  in many ways this is the definition of
perfection a forecast that is seemingly getting better each time we make it with growth a bit higher
unemployment a bit lower and inflation ebbing slightly more  the underlying mechanics that
produce this outcome are relatively straightforward but i wonder whether we should have a
heightened sense of skepticism about such a halcyon outlook  let me focus on two reasons for such
skepticism
first all other things being equal inflation could be less than well behaved  one reason that
inflation ebbed in earlier forecasts was that slower growth brought about a small output gap and
rising unemployment  now the output gap is virtually eliminated and unemployment remains
below 5 percent  ebbing inflation is solely the product of recent favorable inflation readings which
are assumed to persist  lower energy prices declining import prices and falling shelter prices  its
hard to tell at this point whether the recent readings on core inflation are the result of fundamentally
lower inflation pressures or just luck or maybe a combination of the two  i think a similar range of
uncertainty applies to oil prices and the strength of the dollar  with virtually no output gap it seems
to me that while the baseline best guess might be lower inflation for all of the reasons discussed in
the greenbook one should approach that analysis with some caution
second demand could well be stronger  the baseline forecast assumes that consumers
somehow get the message some of us have been trying to deliver about the need for an increase in
private saving  the saving rate moves from a negative 1 percent to a positive 1 percent the highest
saving rate in several years  as i noted before i have to ask myself why this is likely to happen
over the next coming months when it hasnt in the wake of the housing situation in 2006  clearly
the downturn in residential real estate an important political issue in all our districts and certainly
devastating for subprime borrowers in particular hasnt affected consumer spending in general  in
fact household net worth as a share of disposable income remains quite high buoyed in part by a
likely overestimate of real housing values but also by rising equity markets  the timing of the
needed increase in the personal saving rate could well be further out in the future creating some
version of the buoyant consumer alternative scenario instead of the baseline  again with no output
gap the potential for increased inflationary pressure is obvious
in sum the greenbook forecast remains in my view the most likely baseline  there are
downside risks as i mentioned before for the seven alternative scenarios do anticipate some
downside risks but if the housing situation is beginning to stabilize i find it hard to believe that
broader anxiety about it will affect business spending or the consumer as some of these scenarios
contemplate  the bigger risk may well be that business spending picks up in light of consumer
strength unemployment stays low growth exceeds our current projections and resource pressures
become more intense  i am concerned that risks to inflation have grown somewhat since our last
meeting  i think im still in a wait and see mode as i do believe there are downside risks to the
evolution of housing markets  but if the greenbook growth forecast is right the best risk
management on our part may have to be to seek tighter policy sooner rather than later
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan just to clarify i think that the
forecast of consumption is not based on the idea that the saving rate has to rise  rather
consumption is modeled using underlying determinants like income and wealth and an endogenous
indication of that is that saving rises
ms minehan  right
chairman bernanke  anyway you gave the impression that higher saving was itself
something that was going to happen naturally
ms minehan  as i look at the forecast in the greenbook the higher saving ratemoney
out of income thats expected to be there going into savingsis one element that makes
consumption lower than it would otherwise be
chairman bernanke  but the saving rate is not driving the consumption forecast
rather the consumption forecast is driving the saving rate
ms minehan  in the forecast yes
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman first on our cheaper more affordable and perhaps
luckier eleventh district economy we estimate that employment growth ran at a rate slightly
greater than 32 percent last year and our output growth exceeded 4 percent  we do see some
possible slowing but there is still very strong momentum in the texas economy and to an extent in
the new mexican economy despite a lower rig count
what im about to talk about is not based on the buoyancy of the eleventh district economy
but on my talking with ceos as well as the economic projections of our own staff  ive talked with
twentyfive ceos for todays discussion  ive added two and just for the record they are the ceo
of disney and the ceo of mastercard
first my retail contacts with one exception report a pickup in dollar volume and foot
traffic that began with the second half of december and has continued  as a result the walmart
ceo for the united states is much more optimistic and is now forecasting volume expansion of
about 2 to 3 percent  my contact from jcpenney which is in an income range that is double that of
walmart reports a similar pattern of behavior that started the friday before christmas and has
carried forward and says that the consumers feel good about the economy  the one exception
incidentally is 7eleven and i would be upset too  tobacco constitutes 30 percent of their sales
and texas just levied a 10 tax on a 30 carton of cigarettes  otherwise the retailers seem to be
much more optimistic than they were when i last reported  a not unimportant factor in this report
has to do with the phenomenon of gift cards  in the public release of safeway is an interesting piece
of data  their gift card business which is called blackhawk grew 100 percent last year and
dropped 100 million to the pretax bottom line  walmart reportsand this is not yet public
informationa peak giftcard balance for this season of 12 billion  now mind you 70 percent of
the card use occurs before february 1  so this business has extended the retail season and it may
well have affected the buoyancy that im hearing from retailers in terms of their current activity
mastercard confirms the pickup in consumer activity particularly that it began late in the christmas
season and its ceo reports from his contacts certainly much less noise about a possible recession
and sees that risk abating  just to jump forward we forecast based on economic research
economic growth in our district of 27 percent for 2007 which is what mastercard happens to be
projectingso i found that ceo to be instantly credible  disney reports extremely strong
advertising growth  they expect the yearoveryear growth to be 20 percent in terms of their first
quarter network advertising with strength in every sector except for autos according to the ceo
they also report record foot traffic at their parks over the holidays  in contrast ups reports a weak
start to december but a strong finish in the last seven days of the year with yearoveryear numbers
for january not as robust as expectedrunning around 1 percent  the rails also report a bit slower
volume as the ceo of one of the large rail companies said  there are clearly shifts taking place
for example lumber shipments of union pacific and burlington northern are down 25 percent year
over year reflecting the falloff in the construction of homes  both ceos caution that company
yearoveryear numbers are like comparing apples and oranges given the robust growth in the first
quarter of 2006  i did talk to two of the top five housing ceos and a third one a smaller company
they seem to confirm the sense of the staff in that they feel that the housing situation is bottoming
out but they continue to caution that any reading of the housing industry between thanksgiving and
the super bowl is of questionable value
mr moskow  the one with two teams from the seventh district laughter
mr fisher  yes  but here are some data to put this statement in perspective  the
contact from the largest company reports that cancellation rates which were running at 50 percent
in their most stressed markets particularly in california and florida have come back to 20 to
25 percentrelatively good news  one aspect worth noting is that they are getting relief from their
subcontractorsthey estimate on average across the industry about 10 percent cost relief  another
predictable behavior pattern becoming manifest is that the large contractors with very strong
balance sheets are looking to buy the distressed smaller contractors  david i agree with you that we
havent seen all the downturn in housing yet in terms of its effect on the economy but we may well
come out of it with an even more tightly consolidated industry  the bottom line on growth from the
eleventh district perspective is a wagnerian summationthat is the economys growth dynamic is
not as bad as we thought it was sounding when we last read the score  i would summarize it by
saying that the tail in terms of the risk of recession has become much slimmer
however my conclusion is the opposite with regard to inflationthat is on reflection and
working with our staff and listening to ceos i think the tail in terms of risk of higher inflation has
fattened and this is reflected in several reports  just very quicklybecause of my australian
dnaanheuserbusch decided to raise beer prices 2 to 3 percent at yearend  that doesnt bother
me  what bothers me is the price of skilled workers who drink that good beer in terms of whats
happening for wages and total compensation of skilled and unskilled labor  you know that i have
talked about the massive projects that texas utility plans for coal to gas conversion and whether
they get the socalled dirty dozen that theyre planning or just a handful  i did go over with the
ceo the studies that mckinsey bcg and bechtel have provided for them and some interesting
data points came out that i want to summarize  in the summer of 05 they estimated that allin
labor costs for these plants which they estimated per plant would take 46 million worker hours at
3625 an hour  today they dont believe they can get the job done for less than 44 an hour and
because of worker quality issues they now believe it will take 52 million worker hours for each
plant  so if you have a 21 percent per hour increase and a 13 percent increase in hours one
wonders about the ability to see a shortterm reduction in skilled and unskilled labor costs  these
numbers by the way take into account the recent slippage in oil rig activity which is down for the
fifth straight week and also the slowdown in housing and some initial slowdown in commercial
construction  it dovetails with reports like that of bps to us that they decided to pay all their
salaried operators to whom only two years ago they were offering incentive packages to leave
25000 bonuses per year for the next two years to stay  fluors ceo reports that they are having
the largest year in their history of hiring college graduates and the 900 mechanics who work for a
large truck dealer with which i regularly talk are now fetching 35 an hour
another piece of data comes from a study by mckinsey and bcg and i want to talk about
it very briefly in terms of the intermodal transportation system of our country  the shippers tell me
that port congestion is very high  the fleet utilization rate is running at about 95 percent  you
know that i like to talk about panamax ship rates because of their size and liquidity  prices have not
eased since we last met and the interesting factoid is that the tenyearold fleet is available for
purchase at the same price as the fleet expected to be delivered two and a half years from now
these ships run 39 million apiece before their addons which tells you that theres a shortterm
tightness  if you talk to the rails and the effective two operatorstheres really a duopoly in this
country between burlington northern and union pacifictheir pricing is based on opportunity
costs because they do not foresee the ability to expand their networks  this may well facilitate an
upward price spiral as all the infrastructure projects currently on the drawing boards begin whether
txus or some other liquefied natural gas companies projects that we have heard about
a couple of other points with regard to inflation that i think bear watching  these inputs are
anecdotal but i think we have a pretty good survey in terms of the oil and gas operators  most of
the major oil and gas operators would not be surprised to see 40 oil and to see a range between 40
and 60 oilthat fits with the brownycel model that we developed in dallasand for natural
gas prices to ease to a level of about 5 in the spring  thats the good news
i want to mention two other negative news items  one was referred to earlier and that
regards corn prices  the price for corn was 230 a bushel last year if you looked on the graph that
bill i think presented earlier  corn is now running 400 a bushel and the food production
companies we talked to project the price to be 500 by the end of the year  now this is good for
farmers  its good for john deere  its not good if you raise a chicken a cow or a pig and its
certainly not good if youre a human who eats at whataburger one of my other new contacts  i
wont use the language that the ceo used but he reports that his margins are coming under
pressure
the second development may be a bit more disturbing it concerns the cost of imported
goods from china into walmarts network  according to walmarts ceo for international
operations and their vice chairman chinese import prices into walmarts network were
depreciating at an annual rate of between 2 and 5 percent  recently however the rise in chinas
labor costs for their suppliers net of the increase in productivity is leading to import price costs that
are increasing at a rate of approximately 1 percent  to me this development raises an issue that i
think president moskow touched on regarding our views on inflation and perhaps rates going
forward which well talk about tomorrow  at home were seeing unacceptably high and sustained
wage developments for certain critical components of labor which i mentioned earlier  abroad
from germany to china were seeing economic growth rates that are well above sustainable trends
which is why i asked the question about your gap analysis earlier  my own staff calculates that if
you do a gap analysisthat is if you compare current growth to what they estimate trend growth to
bethere is no significant inflationary pressure  however if you analyze capacity utilization rates
in the g7 countries and in the brics we are getting closer given the economic growth that has
been experienced to more heavily used capacity and to igniting inflationary pressures   the bottom
line for inflation from our perspective is that what was once a tailwind generated by globalization
may be closer to becoming a headwind than our models indicate and our limited understanding of
the effect of globalization otherwise leads us to understand  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher just a quick question  i couldnt quite gather
whether you were saying that commercial construction is overall slowing  you mentioned that
once but then you talked about a variety of projects
mr fisher  it appears to be slowing in certain areas and in our district but is nonetheless
running at a stout rate  it seems to have come off somewhat but given the large projects that are
planned the numbers work out to show increasing pressure on the labor thats available to construct
those projects
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i have the sense that since our last meeting
weve received a wealth of data but not necessarily a wealth of information  between the data that
have come in and the conversations that ive had with my district contacts in the past six weeks
im a little more confident about the outlook for real growth and i view the inflation outlook as
unchanged  housing is an example of having more data but not necessarily more information
though some aspects of the residential housing data have been encouraging neither futures on
housing prices nor reports that i have received from people in the business suggest that the
slowdown in that sector will end any time soon  despite that it still looks as though the spillovers
to consumer spending and financial markets have been limited  at our last meeting there was also
some uncertainty regarding the health of the manufacturing sector  for the most part the
intermeeting data have been favorable for the manufacturing sector  the industrial production
numbers for example have been strong but manufacturing employment remains flat
the usual story that makes sense of these disparate trends is the continuing strength in
manufacturing productivity  but id like to mention another element in the pictureothers have
mentioned it this morningand thats the skills mismatches  my directors and business contacts in
the manufacturing sector tell me that they have jobs available but that they face great difficulty in
filling those jobs because they cant find people with the right skills  interestingly as was
mentioned in the staff presentation earlier the jolts data show openings as rising and thats also
true in the manufacturing sector  openings have been rising over the past two years  this news
really isnt so good per se but it does suggest that at least some of the sluggishness in
manufacturing job growth is coming out of the structural elements in the labor markets and is not
purely a cyclical decline in aggregate demand  in a somewhat related vein according to the
national association of colleges and employers college placements are up 17 percent this year the
strongest showing since 2001  the story is that relatively high profits and good business prospects
are driving up demand  we also understand from the ohio governors office that last year although
sales tax receipts were lower income tax receipts were stronger than expected
these bits and pieces combined with some of the positive news in the aggregate data reports
in the past couple of months make me somewhat less worried about the downside risks to economic
growth than i was at the last meeting  i dont want to go overboard on this  i had that feeling
several times last year only to be subsequently moved in the other direction  it is hard to tell
whether some of this good news has been related to weatherthat is some spring activity might
have shifted into the fourth quarter
on the inflation front both the official data and the anecdotal stories from my contacts
continue to provide some encouragement that core inflation will moderate over the next year but
the data are not yet entirely convincing  my staff has noted that for most of 2006 especially in the
later half of the year the growth rates of individual cpi components exhibited a bimodal
distribution  on an expenditureweighted basis most components were either falling in price or
rising at a troubling rate  very few cpi components were rising at a pace that the cpi tells us is
about average  this pattern is highly unusual and i dont know what to make of it except to say
that it does make it more difficult to tell which way the inflation trend is leaning
my only material difference of opinion with the staff baseline projection concerns the
assumption about labor supply  economywide there is some reason to think that aggregate labor
supply is more abundant than the greenbook baseline contemplates  labor force participation rates
for most demographic groups have been running stronger than the staff has been expecting
indicating that the growth of potential output could lie somewhat above the greenbook estimate
thats what i am assuming and therefore i get a slightly better combination of output and inflation 
in the end my outlook for the economy hasnt changed  the general contours of the
forecast for a modest slowdown in growth coupled with a very gradual decline in core inflation
make sense to me  however i have lowered just slightly my assessment of the risk that real growth
will fall short of my projection and i have not changed my risk assessment of inflation  theres
still a notable risk that yearoveryear changes in inflation might remain stuck where they are today
as opposed to drifting down half a point or so over time as i would prefer  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  economic activity in our district lost a bit of
momentum in january  retail sales contracted in recent weeks as automobile dealers noted waning
interest and buyers of bigticket electronic goods stayed home perhaps to watch the big screens
they purchased during the holidays  laughter  another source of slowing was a further pullback
in the factory sector  i should mention new orders in our district slipped in recent weeks on top of
decembers modest contraction and factory hiring edged lower for the second straight month  on
the plus side services firms continued to report moderate growth in revenues and employment
despite this mixed picture however a wide variety of firms remained optimistic about their
prospects six months out  district labor market conditions remained tight and skilled workers
continued to be in strong demand in large metropolitan areas  businesses tell us that they are
pushing up wages as a result
real estate activity is on balance hanging in there  anecdotal reports indicate fairly firm
home sales across many areas in december and were hearing more reports of pockets of strength
in some suburban housing markets around dc though assessments from other areas continue to be
somewhat downbeat  we have also heard that homebuilding activity rose somewhat in a number of
district metropolitan areas in recent weeks  commercial real estate prospects remained relatively
bright with leasing activity firm and a solid number of projects on the books for 07  price
pressures at district firms seem to have moderated somewhat confirming the national trends
the national data flow since our last meeting has been encouraging  the greenbook now
predicts a higher trajectory for real gdp  i agree with the greenbooks shortterm outlook
declining housing construction is still depressing the real growth rate now but demand has
stabilized i think and inventories may be topping out  each batch of housing data has bolstered my
confidence in the trajectory we sketched out last fallnamely that the drag from housing will
mostly disappear by midyear with spillover having been relatively limited
consumer spending has been quite resilient  evidently favorable income prospects have
trumped weakening housing prices  the fundamentals for business investment remain favorable
with the cost of capital low and profitability high and the latest newsthat unfilled orders for
capital goods are continuing to increasefits in well with the view that equipment investment is
likely to be a source of strength going forward  the greenbook has real growth later this year and
into next year returning to trend driven by strength in business investment and solid consumer
spending  i agree with that outlook with the caveat that my estimate of trend growth is higher than
the greenbooks
the inflation news since the last meeting has been encouraging as well  core cpi inflation
was 18 in the fourth quarter and core pce inflation was estimated to have been 21 percent  its
tempting to extrapolate this favorable news forward as the greenbook does and forecast a gradual
downward drift without further overt action by the committee  that outcome is certainly plausible
especially if oil prices cooperate and remain contained within recent trading ranges  but i remain
apprehensive  first core inflation has exhibited fairly substantial highfrequency swings over the
past couple of years  so it will take many more months for me to be very confident that inflation is
trending down  second and related over the past three years large swings in energy prices have
been followed by swings in core inflation with a short lag  indeed the crosscorrelation between
core and energy components of the pce price index seems to have increased in the past few years
the recent dip in core inflation may therefore be the transitory effect of last summers decline in
energy prices and the december uptick in core cpi may signal that its behind us now  a
downward drift in inflation thus is likely to depend critically on the absence of upward movements
in energy prices  note that the staff follows the futures market in assuming as i calculated it a
13 percent rise in oil prices by the end of 2008 which suggests continuing upward pressure on core
inflation  third expectations could well exert a gravitational pull in an upward direction rather than
the downward direction as claimed recently in a popular newsletter and also as the staff indicated
underlies their forecast  personally i place the center of gravity a little higher above 2 percent
the twelvemonth change in core pce inflation has been above 2 percent as we all know since
march 2004 and none of the usual measures of expectations either from surveys or tips markets
are much below 2 percent for the cpi  so even though the recent inflation news has been
comforting i think theres a good reason to continue to worry about it
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the third district have
continued to evolve much as they have for most of the past several months  economic activity is
still expanding  i think i can use the word moderatei dont think anybody else has used that
yet and our contacts expect the pace to be maintained in the coming months  there has been little
change in the pattern of activity over the sectors  retailers in our region indicated that their holiday
sales were about as they expected or somewhat better  housing continues to weaken at a somewhat
orderly pace but there are signs of stabilization of demand  inventory has remained elevated and
construction continues to decline  however the weakness in residential construction is being offset
by continued strength in nonresidential construction  office vacancy rates continue to decline in
philadelphia and in the near suburbs as well  the net absorption of office space has increased for
the past twelve quarters  manufacturing activity in the region hit a soft spot in the fall as i indicated
in previous meetings but our most recent business outlook survey in january presented
somewhat positive but also somewhat mixed signals  the general activity index returned to positive
territory with a reading of plus 8 indicating a slight increase in manufacturing activity and there
was a significant rebound in shipments  new orders however remained close to zero  thats
somewhat of an aberration because new orders and shipments tend to move very much together and
so there are some inconsistencies there which is why i said the situation is a bit mixed  according
to our survey however the firms expect a rebound of general manufacturing activity and orders
over the coming six months  indeed most of our business contacts see moderate growth in the
region continuing for the foreseeable future  their positive attitudes are consistent with the recent
positive news weve had about conditions in the nation  firms remain concerned about their ability
to hire both skilled and unskilled labor  labor markets are tight for many of the reasons that
president minehan described in new england we have some of the same things going on in the
third district
regarding national conditions the unusually warm weather in december may have
temporarily buoyed some of our numbers but based on incoming information ive become
increasingly confident that the national economy has a positive underlying momentum  at the time
of our last meeting there was a contrast between the mixed data on consumption and production
and the relatively strong indications from the labor market  the picture that appears to be emerging
from the latest economic information is one of stronger underlying growth that has been temporarily
weakened by housing and autos  there is little if any evidence that the housing and auto
corrections are spilling over into the other sectors of the economy  weve been looking for those
spillovers for the past six months and have yet to see any significant evidence that they are
occurring or are about to occur  of course spillovers may yet materialize with a long lag but that
likelihood to my mind is diminishing as we have begun to see some hopeful signs of stabilization in
housing  labor market conditions remain firm and manufacturing indicators improved in
december as did capital goods orders  although i didnt talk to the chairman of disney i did talk
to a small manufacturing firm with total revenues that come to 2 million  he has been very
positive about the outlook  his sales depend a lot on construction and he said that after the most
miserable august and september he had ever seen in his twenty years of running the business the
pickup began in late november continued through december and has continued into january as
well  other contacts from banks particularly credit card issuers to whom ive talked suggest that
banks are seeing numbers coming across their books on credit card purchases continuing to be
strong even after christmas  so that also is good news
all of this suggests that the downside risks to growth have receded since our last meeting  i
believe this is the markets assessment as well as expectations of future policy firm  my outlook is
that the economy will return to trend growth which i put at about 3 percent this year and will
continue at that pace into 2008  of course as everybody has indicated thats a little stronger than
the greenbooks outlook and it is again based on my view that potential growth or trend growth is
somewhat higher than the greenbook has stated  i expect the unemployment rate to rise slightly
maybe to 48 percent by the fourth quarter of this year and then to stabilize into next year  i think
this is going to be accompanied by employment growth of nearly 1 percent and again thats what
accounts for the difference in the trend growth
i anticipate a decline in core pce inflation of about 04 percent by 2008  i would like to
underscore that this forecast is not driven by a lower passthrough of oil prices which have
declined  my reading of the empirical evidence including work done by some people on the
philadelphia staff is that its very difficult to attribute movements in core inflation of six months to
twelve months or longer periods to changes in oil prices  in fact theres growing empirical
evidence that neither movements in oil prices nor phillips curve type factors significantly improve
our root mean square error forecasts of core inflation two or more quarters ahead  i note that this
refers to forecasts of six months or longer and not to shortrun highfrequency movements  this
suggests that we should be careful in the language we use describing the reasons for our projections
of future inflation to avoid perpetuating views of inflation processes that we cant empirically
substantiate
in my view core inflation will not come back down until monetary conditions which i
believe have been very accommodative over the past few years have tightened sufficiently  the
greenbook forecast has a slightly smaller decline in core pce inflation to about 2 percent in 2008
but incorporates a less restrictive monetary policy than i believe is likely to be appropriate given my
view of the strength of the underlying economy and of the fundamentals that we are seeing  indeed
over the past two meetings my feeling was that the slowdown in economic activity that we might
be seeing combined with a constant fed funds rate might have been enough to bring inflation back
to a more acceptable level  now im less convinced that price stability will be achieved without
further action on our part some time later this year  but i will leave that discussion to the policy go
round  thank you
chairman bernanke  mr vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  charlie im not sure i understand your thinking  you
said that you expect what sounded like a pretty significant moderation in core pce but thats on a
monetary policy assumption that implies further tightening
mr plosser  thats right somewhat tighter somewhat more aggressive than whats in
the greenbook
vice chairman geithner  though i dont want to pin you down that sounds sort of
modest  you are saying that with another 25 basis points youd get what core pce inflation over
the forecast period
mr plosser  the path i was thinking about as i was doing the forecast and trying to
determine the appropriate policy heremy desire is to get inflation down lower and thats reflected
in my forecastis one in which the fed funds rate goes up somewhat from where it is today
perhaps to 5 or 5 percent  but then by the end of 07 and into 08 its coming back down again
to more of a steadystate level and then we can talk about what the real neutral rate is
vice chairman geithner  just in orders of magnitudeif we did another 25 or 50
basis points and there were some sort of associated changes in overall financial conditions so that
that was reinforced youd get a core pce inflation forecast that would go how far down  would it
go to 15
mr plosser  well theres some uncertainty about that  i think it would get to between
15 and 2 percent
chairman bernanke  thank you  its 430  why dont we take a fifteenminute
coffee break
coffee break
chairman bernanke  would you come to order please  thank you  we are ready
to recommence with the goround  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman now that i have everyones attention laughter
im going to start with some information on the district and then talk briefly about the national
economy from my perspective  let me begin by saying that the districts activity did slow over the
second half of 2006 in line with the national economy itself  the slowdown was most apparent in
housing and manufacturing  however the most recent data that we have from november and
december indicate a pickup in some of the activity  moreover reports from our directors and our
business contacts suggest a considerable degree of optimism among them going forward more than
we expected actually  one area in which we are seeing signs of improvement is housing itself
while new construction activity does remain subdued in our region sales activity has picked up
and the inventory situation appears to be improving in our major markets  nonresidential
construction remains strong and is offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side  district
employment growth has risen in recent months and labor markets remain tight for us  in addition to
continuing shortages of skilled workers in a large number of technical and professional areas we
have recently received reports that the hospitality and recreational sectors are experiencing difficulty
in finding lowerskilled workers as well  we have also received numerous reports from directors in
district businesses indicating higher yearend wage and salary increases
the situation in agriculture is somewhat mixed  the sharp increases in crop prices
especially corn driven by exports of ethanol and exports of corn itself have caused the usda to
boost estimates of 2007 farm income rather significantly  however higher crop prices are also
eroding profitability of livestock producers and processors in our region which is a fairly important
sector
one important sector in which activity appears likely to slow in 2007 is energy  the district
economy has benefited tremendously over the past few years from the rise in energy prices which
has spurred increased production of traditional productsand that includes oil gas and coalas
well as alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  according to reports from a couple of our
directors however the recent decline in energy prices has already led to a reduction in drilling
activity and is likely to cause some cutbacks in new investment in alternative fuels as well
turning to the national outlook i like others have noted the recent strength in the economy
and have raised my estimates of growth for the fourth quarter and somewhat raised them for the first
quarter  i continue to expect growth to rise over 2007 modestly toward what i think is potential in
the neighborhood of 3 percent  however now i expect it to occur a little more quickly than i did at
the december meeting  accordingly recent economic information has led me to reassess the
balance of risks to the outlook  i believe the downside risks from the further slowing of housing
have diminished somewhat  moreover i share the view that the recent weakness in manufacturing
activity reflects a better balancing of production and inventories rather than a fundamental
weakness  going forward the improved outlook for energy prices should support consumer
spending by improving consumers disposable income and we may see additional fiscal stimulus
resulting from the morefavorable budget positions of the state and local governments
finally in terms of the inflation outlook my views have not changed materially since the
last meeting  ive been encouraged by the recent inflation data and i continue to expect inflation to
decline over the forecast period  i expect the core cpi to be in the 23 percent range and core pce
inflation to be about 2 percent for 2007  however as others have noted core inflation is too high
and considerable uncertainty remains about whether the recent progress will be sustained
particularly it is not clear how the opposing trends of lower energy prices and greater resource
pressures may play out over the next few quarters  consequently it seems to me that there is upside
risk to the inflation outlook  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president barron
mr barron  thank you mr chairman  i thought id focus a little more today in my
comments on the state of florida as it relates to the housing sector  weve heard a lot more positive
comments in just the past few minutes about housing  so let me offer a contrarian view if you will
florida accounts for about 41 percent of our district employment and 6 percent of overall us
employment  as for housing florida represented 8 percent of us home sales in 2005 and 6
percent in 2006 as sales and construction continued to decline  to put these numbers in perspective
singlefamily existing home sales in florida have dropped 40 percent since january 2005 versus an
11 percent decline in the united states as a whole  anecdotal reports are that builders are
continuing to work down existing inventory and are not starting new projects  in most areas of the
state starts have fallen even more than sales which should lessen the runup in housing inventory
over the immediate future  permit issuance for singlefamily homes is down 54 percent in florida
since january 2005 compared with 28 percent in the nation as a whole  there are certain
encouraging signs from reports noting as mentioned earlier that buyer traffic is better in some
areas and several of the building contacts that we spoke with expect or perhaps i would note more
accurately are hopeful that new home sales will improve by the second quarter of 2007
home prices have declined modestly but remain well above the levels implied by the pre
2003 trends in most areas  this places housing affordability at a relatively low level by historical
standards  as i noted at previous meetings the demand in coastal markets is being constrained by
the steep rise in homeownership insurance that has caused monthly housing costs to rise sharply
even as house prices moderate  weve heard reports that in markets where prices accelerated the
most in recent years such as south florida employers are struggling to recruit staff because of the
high housing costs with some firms electing to leave south florida and others beginning to convert
corporate owned land to corporate housing just so that they can recruit employees  as i reported at
our last meeting the decline in housing activity continues to have a negative effect on housing
related sectors specifically in the south because of our concentration in the carpet and other related
industries  housingrelated employment is no longer a net contributor to yearoveryear
employment growth in the united states even though overall job growth has remained very firm
district banks reported that credit quality has softened but remains at very strong levels
however banks are beginning to be a bit more vocal in expressing concern with regard to the
possibility that builders will face financial problems in the coming months  in addition banks
express concern about the number of speculative condominium projects in south florida  district
banks have lower earnings targets for 2007 and the expectation is that bank merger and acquisition
activity and layoffs will increase in the coming year  some banks are even putting out the for sale
sign in the hope of cashing out now noting that things could get ugly over the next two years in
some areas
outside the housing sector indicators of economic performance in the district were mixed
reports on holidayrelated sales were on the positive side whereas tourism remains relatively
mixed across the district  reports from the manufacturing sector were also mixed with a weakness
in the housingrelated industries offset to some extent by the expanding activity in industries related
to defense and energy
for the us economy as a whole the drag from housing that we experienced over the
second half of 2006 does not appear at this time to pose a serious threat to the overall economy
although some forecasters anticipate belowtrend real gdp growth for the end of 2006 and the first
quarter of 2007  most would say that this situation is temporary and would anticipate that real gdp
growth will rebound and be close to the trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007  our staff
projections of real gdp growth have had about the same tone as those of the external forecasters
our staff believes real gdp growth will be sustained in 2007 by job creation that should match the
experience that weve seen in 2006
measured core inflation was well in excess of 2 percent at the end of 2006  the staff
forecast is that core inflation will continue to hover just above 2 percent for all of 2007  the
expectation is that price growth in services will continue to dominate core inflation going forward
in my comments ive focused a bit more on housing  i would just close by noting that my
continued concern would be the lack of impetus to drive down inflation over the long term  thank
you
chairman bernanke  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i have to start by saying that its hard to
compete with my colleague richard fisher with his stable of contacts  i have perhaps just a
slight amendment on walmart  my contact there said that he has observed in recent years a
changing pattern of holiday shopping with shoppers procrastinating and putting their shopping
closer to christmas and that might have moved some sales from november to december also
the growth of the gift card business moved some of those sales into january  those
circumstances might explain a bit of what were seeing  he said that it looks as though the
january samestore sales growth will come in at 2 to 2 percent  im sure thats consistent
with richards information  my contact points out that although those numbers are a little better
than what they had anticipated a month or two ago they are still 200 basis points below the
original plan which was set about a year ago  for february their plan is 4 percent but he
believes that anything north of 3 would be good performance  his view is that he doesnt see a
lot of momentum one way or another that things are pretty steady and that theres been no
particularly significant change in the situation
my fedex contact sees business as very steady  there was a very strong peak season
pretty much on projection  the one negative he sees is in the lessthantruckload business and
that confirms information coming directly from a trucking industry source as well  basically the
outlook is good steady and very confident  as for capital expenditures fedex is expecting to
have 15 percent above this fiscal year in the next fiscal year which starts june 1  my contact
does not see any particular labor market pressures  my ups contact said that the company is
cutting its capex and they are actually cutting capacity  he said that they are cutting out twelve
flights i think it was that they had just added in june  the cuts are basically a consequence of a
careful analysis of their express business which showed that a lot of it is just unprofitable
particularly the shipping of packages to individual homes  they are renegotiating contracts with
online retailers and mail order retailers and theyre trying to shed some of that business
my trucking industry contact says that things just dont look very sound  freight volume
which would be full truckloads is actually off 4 percent year over year in january  shipping
rates are flat but there are intense pressures from their clients to cut rates  driver turnover is up
because the drivers are not getting enough business to eat well and so they are shopping around
for other companies  so they are losing some drivers but theyre not too worried because they
have plenty of drivers at the moment  the intermodal business is holding up well my contact
said
id like to just make one brief comment on the national outlook  i think its pretty clear
and its reflected around the table that the outlook for real gdp is a bit stronger than it was at
our december meeting and depending on your perspective in reading the data maybe the
inflation picture is a bit better too  but i would emphasize that compared with past revisions of
the outlook these are really marginal and not material revisions  there hasnt been any really
big news here  we dont want to get carried away with a flow of data that is only slightly
stronger
let me also comment along the same lines about what has been going on with longer
term interest rates  at the time of our december meeting the constantmaturity tenyear rate
was 449  at least thats what i have in my spreadsheet  on friday it was 488  there has been
a lot of comment to that effect  i think that change is due partly to the string of marginally
stronger news and partly to a change in the markets assessment about our likely future behavior
the market has simply taken out the expectation of a rate cut in the near term  the market has
looked again at where we are to a much greater extent than we ourselves have  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you
mr lacker  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  do you think thats because they have changed their minds about our
reaction function or about how the shocks are likely to come in between now and then
mr poole  i suspect that its a combination  but i also think that a number of us in
our speeches have been saying things such as that we think policy is at about the right place  if
we repeat that often enough the markets begin to think that were not about to cut rates
mr lacker  so what about our statement in october  did they miss that
mr poole  i guess that its a consequence of the interaction between what weve been
saying and the flow of data  you have to be careful about doublecounting here but the flow of
data has perhaps convinced the market that what we were saying is right because the market i
think had developed a somewhat different sense of where the economy was going than they had
thought that we held
vice chairman geithner  does mr lacker have an alternative explanation
mr lacker  i think hes right  he is suggesting that his belief is that the reaction
function they hold to hasnt changed much in the past month or two but that the shocks have
come in more consistent with our assessment of how they were going to come in  is that fair
mr poole  yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  just a few quick points
we feel somewhat better about the outlook for growth and inflation but we havent really
changed our forecasts for 07 and 08  so just as we expected over the past few cycles we
currently expect gdp to grow roughly at the rate of potential over the forecast period which we
believe is still around 3 percent and we expect the rate of increase in the core pce to moderate a
bit more to just below 2 percent over the forecast period  we see somewhat less downside risk
to growth and somewhat less upside risk to inflation than we did but the overall balance of risks
in our view is still weighted toward inflationthe risk that it fails to moderate enough or soon
enough  the basic nature of the risks to both those elements of our forecast hasnt really
changed
as this implies our forecast still has somewhat stronger growth and somewhat less
inflation than the greenbook does  the differences however are smaller than they have been
we see the same basic story that the greenbook does in support of continuing expansion going
forward  we have similar assumptions for the appropriate path of monetary policyat least two
perhaps several quarters of a nominal fed funds rate at current levels  the main differences
between our view about the economy and the greenbooks relate first as they have for some
time to the likely growth in hours were still not inclined to build in a substantial reduction in
trend labor force growth  second our view is that inflation has less inertia less persistence than
it has exhibited over the past halfcentury  third we tend to think that changes in wealth have
less effect on consumer behavior than does the staff
we have seen a general convergence in views in the market as we just discussed toward
a forecast close to this view close to the center of gravity in this room and a very significant
change in policy expectations as well  we can take some comfort from this but i dont think we
should take too much  markets still seem to display less uncertainty about monetary policy and
asset prices and quite low probabilities to even modest increases in risk premiums than i think is
probably justified
let me just go through the principal questions briefly  is the worst behind us in both
housing and autos  probably but we cant be sure yet  if we get some negative shock to
incometo demand growthwere still vulnerable to a more adverse adjustment in housing
prices with potentially substantially negative effects on growth in part because of the greater
leverage now on household balance sheets  how strong does the economy look outside autos
and housing  pretty strong it seems  we see no troubling signs of weakness despite the
disappointment on some aspects of investment spending  what does the labor market strength
tell us about the risk to the forecast  it seems obvious that on balance it justifies some caution
about upside risk to growth and more than the usual humility about what we know about slack
and trend labor force growth  but i dont think it fundamentally offers a compelling case on its
own for a substantial change to the inflation forecast or the risks to that forecast
is there any new information on structural productivity growth  not in our view  were
still fairly comfortable with the staff view of around 2 percent or 2 percent for the nonfarm
business sector  im not a great fan of the anecdote but ill cite just one  if you ask people who
make stuff for a living on a substantial scale its hard to find any concern that they are seeing
diminished capacity to extract greater productivity growth in their core businesses  thats not a
general observation just a small one
have the inflation risks changed meaningfully in either direction  i think the recent
behavior of the core numbers and of expectations is reassuring  the market doesnt seem
particularly concerned about inflation and the market is therefore vulnerable to a negative
surprise to a series of higher numbers  can we be confident well get enough moderation with
the current level of longterm expectations prevailing in markets with the expected path of slack
in the economy and with the range of potential forces that might operate on relative prices
energy import and other prices  again i think this forecast still seems reasonable but we cant
be that confident and we need to be concerned still about the range of sources of vulnerability of
that forecast  another way to frame this question is is the inflation forecast consistent with the
current expectations for the path of monetary policy acceptable to the committee  we havent
fully confronted that issue because we dont get much moderation with a monetary policy
assumption thats close to whats in the markets  but i dont think theres a compelling case to
act at this stage in a way that forces convergence on that  in other words how tight is monetary
policy and how tight are overall financial conditions today  i dont think theres a very strong
case for us to induce more tightness or more accommodation than now prevails  theres a good
case for patience and for giving ourselves a fair amount of flexibility going forward within the
context of an asymmetric signal about the balance of risks and a basic judgment that we view the
costs of a more adverse inflation outcome as the predominant concern of the committee
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  in preparation for submitting my forecast i
looked at my previous forecastsa humbling but instructive experience usually  laughter
going back a year i found that based on the staffs estimate for 2006 inflation and growth had
each turned out within a quarter point of my projections  im quite certain that this is not a
consequence of any particular expertise on my part  rather it is indicative that in a broad sense
the economy is performing remarkably close to our expectations  president poole was making
this point  even going back a few years to when we started to remove accommodation despite
large fluctuations in energy prices in recent years huge geopolitical uncertainties and a housing
boom and bust the dimensions of which we really didnt anticipate three years ago the economy
is in the neighborhood of full employment and core inflation is at a fairly low rate by historical
standards
now the surprises last year were the surge of inflation in the spring and early summer
that has not been entirely reversed  the extent of the slowdown in productivity growth both in
terms of trend and of actual relative to the lower estimated trend and the related decline in the
unemployment rate suggest that we are entering 2007 with a higher risk of inflation than i had
anticipated a year ago  given this risk it is especially important that economic growth be no
greater and perhaps a little less than the growth rate of potential and that is my forecasta small
uptrend in the unemployment rate  the issue i wrestled with was how fast the economy will be
growing when the drag from housing abates  in early december the debate might have been
about whether demand would be sufficient to support growth as high as potential  but given the
stabilization of housing demand the strength of consumption and ongoing increases in
employment i asked myself whether we might not find the economy growing faster than its
potential beginning in the second half of 2007 and in 2008 thereby adding to inflation pressures
a couple of forces however gave me a little comfort in supporting my projection of only
moderate growth  one is the modest restraint on demand from the recent rise in interest rates
especially the restraint on the housing market and the dollar exchange rate  another is the
likelihood that consumption will grow more slowly relative to income and will lag the response
to housing as housing prices level out and as energy prices begin to edge higher  consumption
late last year was probably still being boosted substantially by the past increases in housing
wealth and by the declines in energy prices which combined with warm weather to give a
considerable lift to disposable income  on the housing wealth factor i think our model suggests
that it takes several quarters for a leveling out in housing wealth to build into consumption  in
fact the data through the third quarter suggest that prices were really just about leveling out in
the third quarter  so it may be a little early to conclude that just because were not seeing a
spillover from the housing market to consumption there isnt going to be any  i expect some
though modest spillover  moreover some of the impulse in the fourth quarter was from net
exports  these were spurred in part by a temporary decline in petroleum imports and an
unexpected strength in exports  those conditions are unlikely to be sustained  in addition
business investment spending has been weaker than we anticipated  now i suspect this is like
the inventory situation just an aspect of adapting to a slower pace of growth and investment will
strengthen going forward  but it does suggest that businesses are cautious  they are not
anticipating ebullient demand and a pressing need to expand facilities to meet increases in sales
and their sense of their market seems worth factoring into our calculations  finally the fact that
i would have been asking just the opposite question seven weeks ago suggests that were also
putting a lot of weight on a few observations laughter whether regarding the weakness then or
the strength more recently
i do continue to believe that growth close to the growth rate of potential will be consistent
with gradually ebbing inflation  for this i would round up the usual suspects reflecting the
ebbing of some temporary factors that increased inflation in 2006  one factor is energy prices
empirical evidence since the early 1980s to the contrary notwithstanding the coincidence that
president lacker remarked between the rise and fall in energy prices in 2006 and the rise and fall
in core inflation suggests some cause and effect  the increase in energy prices into the summer
has probably not yet been completely reversed in twelvemonth core inflation rates so i expect
some of that to be dying out as we go into the future  increases in rents are likely to moderate as
units are shifted from ownership to rental markets  the slowdown in growth relative to earlier
last year seems to have made businesses more aware of competitive pressures restraining pricing
power  when we met last spring we had a lot of discussion about businesses feeling that they
had pricing powerthat they could pass through increases in costs  i havent heard any of that
discussion around the table today
the recent slowdown in inflation is encouraging but not definitive evidence that the
moderation is in train  the slowdown could have been helped by the decline in energy prices
and that decline wont be repeated  goods prices might have been held back by efforts to run off
inventories and that phenomenon too would be temporary  as i already noted the initial
conditionsthe recent behavior of productivity and the relatively low level of the unemployment
ratesuggest upward inflation risks relative to this gentle downward tilt  to an extent the staff
has placed a relatively favorable interpretation on these developments  they havent revised
trend productivity down any further  they expect a pickup in realized productivity growth over
this year  they see a portion of the strength in labor markets as simply lagging the slowdown in
growtha little more labor hoarding than usual as the economy cools along with some
statistical anomalies  thus in the greenbook the unemployment rate rises and inflation
pressures remain contained as activity expands at close to the growth rate of potential
president yellen at the last meeting and bill wascher today pointed out two less benign
possibilities  one is that demand really has been stronger as indicated by the incomeside data
and that the labor and product markets really are as tight as the unemployment rate suggests  in
this case the unemployment rate wouldnt drift higher with moderate growth  businesses might
find themselves facing higher labor costs and being able to pass them on unless we take steps to
firm financial conditions  the second possibility is that trend productivity is lower  in this case
actual productivity growth might not recover much this year  unit labor costs would rise more
quickly  given the apparent momentum in demand we might be looking at an even further
decline in the unemployment rate in the near term  now my outlook is predicated on something
like the staff interpretation but i think these other possibilities underline the inflation risks in an
economy in which growth has been well maintained  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor bies
ms bies  thank you mr chairman  like several of you im going to focus on
housing and what were seeing in the banking sector and in mortgage performance  since the
last meeting i am feeling better about the housing market in the aggregate  it looks as though
home sales are stabilizing for the fourth quarter  on the whole home sales actually did go up a
bit  the inventory of new homes for sale has now fallen for five months through december and
mortgage applications for home purchases continue to move above the levels of last summer
when they hit bottom  the national association of realtors is estimating that existing home
sales have already bottomed out and homebuilder sentiment improved in three of the four past
months  but even if sales really have stabilized the inventory of homes for sale still must be
worked down before construction and growth resume in this market  given that some existing
homes have likely been pulled off the market in light of slower sales and moderating housing
prices this inventory correction period will probably continue into 2008  i think this is
particularly true in markets such as florida as first vice president barron mentioned where a
large amount of speculative investment occurred during the boom periodwith three to five
years of excess construction from the investor side  so those homes still have to be worked
through
asset quality in the consumer sector as a whole is very good  we have come through one
of the most benign periods  the exception as bill mentioned in his presentation earlier today is
the subprime market  when you dissect it you see that prime mortgage delinquencies are flat
and subprime mortgages at a fixed rate are flat  the whole problem is in subprime arms which
are running into difficulties  the four federal regulatory agencies are looking harder at some of
these subprime products  we started reviewing 228 mortgages and now were looking at and
testing some other products  were finding that the issues are getting more troublesome the
further we dig into these products  to put the situation in perspective subprime arms are a
very small part of the whole mortgage market  as vincent mentioned subprime is about 13
percent and the arm piece of the subprime is about half to twothirds so were talking perhaps
around 8 percent of the aggregate mortgages outstanding  were seeing that the borrowers who
got into these during the teaser periods now are seeing tremendous payment shocks  for
example 228s that are going from the fixed twoyear period to the adjustment period basically
had their interest rates double so theyre going from a 5 percent handle to a 10 percent handle
and the borrowers dont have the discretionary income to absorb that  this type of mortgage was
sold to a lot of subprime borrowers on the idea that they are lending vehicles to repair credit
scores  you will show that you are going to pay during the early period and then you can
refinance and get a lower longterm rate so youll never pay the jump  but were finding that
some of these mortgages have significant prepayment penalties and so to refinance and get the
better terms some borrowers are getting into difficulty  because of the moderation in housing
prices these borrowers havent built up enough equity to absorb the prepayment penalty  so the
problem stems from a combination of factors  there are a lot of spins on these products but
were trying to take an approach based on principles in looking at whats really happening
i also want to mention that although the ownership of the mortgages is very diffuse and
so were not seeing any real concentrated risk particularly in banking we do need to pay more
attention to where the mortgageservicing exposures are  the servicing of these mortgages that
are securitized is concentrated in certain institutions  clearly when you have such a high level
of delinquencies and potential defaults all profitability in servicing is gone  so there could be
some chargeoffs in these securitized mortgages  also i think all of you have noticed the
number of mortgage brokers that have closed up shop in the past six months because they
couldnt get enough liquidity or capital to repurchase the early defaults of these recent pools
that is really shrinking the origination pocket  i should also say that with the exception of the
subprime arm mortgages we feel very good about overall credit quality
when i look at the economy as a whole i also see that except for housing construction
and autos the rest of the economy is sound  the recent growth in employment and the strong
wage growth give me comfort that the income growth of consumers is there to mitigate some of
the wealth effects that we may have with moderating housing prices  but i also share the
concerns that some of you mentioned here and that president yellen spoke of in a speech about
the issue regarding productivity trends and wage growth and determining how fast the economy
is growing  productivity is going to have to grow faster to absorb the higher wage growth
particularly as employment growth continues strong and i think the slack in the skilled labor
force is getting very very limited
when i think in aggregate about the data since our last meeting i feel a little better
about inflation because it appears to be moderating but im not jumping for joy because we need
a few more months  however the growth information has been instead of mixed as at the last
meeting generally stronger and that does make me feel better  in net then based on the recent
information im even a bit further along on the side that the risks have moved higher for
inflation than on the side of the risk of a slowdown in the economy  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i thought id provide just a couple of
perspectives first on the 2006 economy and then by extrapolation on the trends in 07  with
respect to 2006 i think the economy outperformed market expectations and greenbook
expectations for probably at least four reasons  the first is the underlying strength of the
employment market which has been much discussed today  second the strength and durability
of household finance which as vice chairman geithner said turned out to be far more
determined by w2 income than some of the household balance sheet items like home equity and
stock market effects  but we need to take another look at that trend in 2007  third the
economic outperformance in 06 had much to do with the resilience of the us capital markets
as evidenced in credit spreads and other financial instruments particularly in the face of some
rather seismic eventsonetime potentially systemic events like the amaranth advisors
collapse cyclical price spikes with respect to commodity prices that may well have been
somewhat demanddriven a series of supply shocks driven by oil and a seeming transition to
slower growth in the middle of the year  fourth were the continued powerful sources of liquidity
that smoothed the transition over the several bumps in the road
i also looked at what the most reliable and the least reliable indicators of the state of the
economy in 06 were to see whether those signposts might hold for 07  i think the tax receipt
information that we saw in 06 was telling us that incomes were likely ahead of trendtax
receipts for 06 were up a total of 116 percent  corporate profits which were up 92 percent in
the past four years had another remarkable year up in the midteens  stock prices obviously
closely related to corporate profits were up 84 percent in the past four years and up about 15
percent in 2006  credit spreads continued to trend tighter highyield spreads were down about
100 basis points from september  another couple of reasonably reliable indicators for 06 were
the household survey of employment which suggested early and often that employment growth
was likely to be ahead of expectations and merger and acquisition pipelines which suggested a
degree of confidence in the markets by business leaders and other folks involved in finance
a less reliable indicator for 2006 growth was the shape of the yield curve and the
suggestion from most of us around the table to the markets was that the yield curve wasnt
predicting much by way of recession in the short term  another less reliable indicator was the
consumer confidence and business confidence surveys which seemed to snap all over the place
perhaps more because of geopolitical events and some shortterm data than any really driving
profile  with respect to inflation it is hard to find any indicators that were very good at telling
us its path but i do think that the tips spread even when there was much talk in the spring and
the summer about rising inflation seemed to stay relatively well anchored and not to move too
much based on some of that noise in the data  so that indicator seems to have been reasonably
good  as was mentioned earlier monthly cpi and pce core measures seemed to be moving
around rather significantly so it was hard for us to determine too much from them as 2006 went
forward
taking all of that into account as i think about 2007 i find that analyzing those
indicators is not without significant peril but let me attempt doing so  the trends appeared
supportive of strong balanced economic growth for 2007 and although inflation expectations
are well anchored and recent highfrequency data appear promising i remain much more
concerned about inflation prospects than about growth  having said that i do think that as an
institution we go into 2007 with probably even heightened credibility on the inflation front and
in terms of our perspectives on the economy which should help us over the next twelve months
two key themes summarize my views on 2007  first strong employment trends should
continue to support consumer spending  second strong corporate balance sheets and balanced
global growth should support capital expenditures  now of those two themes i would note that
i have considerably more confidence in the former than in the latter  ill spend another moment
on that shortly  the tone of the markets appears to be exceptionally strong  spreads have
tightened even as yields have trended back to 5 percent  over november and december we had
three weeks each with more than 11 billion being priced in the highyield market  just to give
some perspective on that fact for the year 2000 there was a total of 50 billion in the highyield
market  but what has happened in the past six weeks that might be able to inform our
judgments  double b spreads have tightened about 25 basis points single bs have tightened
50 basis points and triple c spreads have tightened 70 basis points in the past six weeks all of
which continues to signal to me that the economy maintains a relative strength and that investors
feel confident about the bets that theyre making  in summary i would say there are significant
tails on both sides of this rather strong base case for the economy but the economy is more
likely to track above the expectations of the greenbook
let me spend a couple of moments on the consumer  contacts from two large credit card
companies to whom i spoke last week expect and have seen in january the same kind of strength
that they saw in december  the first three weeks of january look to be a continuation of the late
but positive trend in the fourth quarter  for what its worth the contacts own projections are
that the first quarter will be rather strong much like the fourth quarter ended up being  today
weve all tried to wrestle with what the greenbook referred to as the unexplained strength of
household spending during 2006 to determine its effect on 07  let me spend a couple of
moments on a hypothesis that the contacts proffered regarding that strength which the
greenbook references in its buoyant consumer simulation
what that strength may well prove is that employees worked more earned more and had
more savings from their household balance sheets to fund consumption than the data to this point
are suggesting  i think that could turn out to be the case in 2007  first people worked more
the benchmark payroll survey on total job creation may well be revised upward again
significantly like the revision of last year  gains in service jobs may well be less counted than
some of the losses in other kinds of jobsanother bias for upward revisions  the jolts data to
which president pianalto referred continue to be very positive suggesting a real dynamism in the
economy that may well be accelerating  participation rates may continue their recent spike as
new workers selectively choose to enter this marketplace  average hours worked moved up in
the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 22 percent and that trend could continue  so monthly
employment gains have not proved much harder to achieve as we approach what we thought was
full employment and the nairu may be lower than estimated  second people certainly may
well have earned more  average hourly earnings were up 42 percent for 06 an acceleration
that was rather widespread from 05 measures  though the data on compensation continue to be
mixed they do seem to be trending in that direction  the divergence between profits and
compensation suggests to me at least that there is large upside potential for unemployment to
stay low and for wages to accelerate perhaps in a catchup for wage gains that we didnt see
earlier in the cycle  third as a result of working more and earning more i suspect that workers
may continue to spend more particularly with the gift of what seems to be relatively low oil
prices in the midfifties  the oil price seems to me to have less of a risk premium and now
appears to reflect some elevated supply and at least modestly lower demand  in sum with
respect to the consumer side i am reasonably well confident
ill spend just a moment on the business side of the equation  fourthquarter profits
appear to be quite good with twothirds of companies beating estimates  as many of these
companies are challenged to have doubledigit earnings in 2007 they may look for other avenues
in which to buy those earningsin the ma worldor increase cash outlays through share
repurchases from their excess cash on the balance sheet to maintain earnings per share growth in
the double digits  another alternative is that they might choose to increase capex as many of us
including myself would have expected them to do earlier in this cycle  doing so could have a
negative effect on shortterm earnings but would show some real confidence in their longterm
investment and growth plans  as already mentioned shipments and orders fell in the fourth
quarter and our working explanation is that much of that fall is really an inventory adjustment
weve had that discussion for a while  i would expect business investment and industrial
production to pick up  if it doesnt do so in the first quarter my confidence about this side of the
economy about this leg of the stool will be significantly reduced  between now and the next
time we meet we will have a better sense of whether that turn on the business side of the
economy is real or whether we just saw a false start in december  so i think well be able to
come to a much firmer view when we meet in six weeks  all in all i remain reasonably
confident and optimistic about the forecast  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  well the data have come in so far according
to plan and you can thank chairman bernanke for doing that  i think he has some special
relations with the bea and others  laughter  exactly as we had hoped they would and said
they would the data show moderation in growth with a prospect for accelerating growth through
2007 and moderation in inflationagain according to plan  i think my views are similar to
those that president stern put forward  the economy has shown an enormous amount of
resilience
i want to talk about a few possible puzzles in the way the data have evolved and could
perhaps deviate from plan as we go forward  one puzzle is the great strength of the consumer
the consumer has been very very strong for the past five years and it seems that no matter what
has happenedwhether a housing downturn an equitymarket downturn or a september 11
the consumer has come through rather strongly and continues to be strong  we certainly have
had a slowdown in the housing market and maybe were waiting to see its effect on the
consumer as don kohn mentioned  but it may just be that some special factors have come in
for example we have had very strong international economic growth and perhaps that will
persist  when you talk to officials and business people outside the united states whether in
emerging market economies in the gulf region or in industrial economies they are extremely
optimistic much more so than i have ever before seen and that may continue  obviously there
is a risk factor here  the recent strengthening in equity markets perhaps offsets some of the
reduction in the asset values of homes  lower consumer energy prices of course have been an
offsetting factor and labor market strength and increases in compensation have been very
important  but theres an upside risk that we will continue to have very very strong
consumption instead of having our error correction go back toward more saving
second with respect to investment we have had orders above shipments for quite some
time but we have had investment actually declining or at least not growing as we would expect
overall in this recovery we have had weaker investment growth and we have had very high
profitability  that raises another puzzle for me  why have we seen somewhat weak investment
over the long run and especially more recently given that most measures of consumer
confidence and business confidence have been positive equity markets seem to be positive
spreads seem to be low and so forth  why are we not seeing more investment  investment may
turn around in the next quarter or so and then well be out of the woods  but i think the
conditions that we predict will lead to an investment turnaround have been there for quite some
time and we havent seen the investment turnaround and that is a puzzle to me
third with respect to inflation obviously we are all pleased that the numbers have been
coming out with greater moderation  but i have a discomfort about exactly what is driving that
moderation  we have good shortterm stories about how the slowdown in energy prices in the
second and third quarters and some other temporary factors with respect to owners equivalent
rent could be bringing down inflation  but when we consider a longer period and try to look at
the systematic data we dont see those kinds of relationships  are we just in some sort of regime
shift  are those correlations not very good because we just havent had a lot of variation in the
data over the past ten to twenty years and so those forces are actually there but we just find it
very difficult to pull them out econometrically  for me that is a puzzle to be able to tell a short
term story with each of these pieces but when i go to the staff and ask well what is the
systematic evidence on it they say well it really isnt there  that is a bit disturbing for me
in trying to figure out where things are likely to go
things have moved in a benign way  i dont think theres a strong expectation that they
would move in a nonbenign way  but i dont have a lot of confidence that i understand why they
have moved as they have  so my concern is that various shocks or other factors could come in to
move them in a way that is not nearly so benign  broadly however i share the views that most
people have expressed around the table that we have good growth prospects going forward and
so far reasonable moderation of inflation  but precisely because we have those good growth
prospects and because we may have had some temporary factors that have kept down inflation
we have to be ever mindful of the upside risk to inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  well im last in this line and ill try to be
brief so that we can get to dinner soon  i do see signs of stabilization in the housing market and
the way to think of it in terms of spillovers is that we do expect some spillovers through the
natural effect of weaker housing on aggregate demand and on wealth  but were not seeing
anything out of the ordinary or a persistent pattern and that gives me more confidence that
nothing really bad is going to happen here  my view is that the risks to the downside have
decreased substantially  also the tone of the recent data actually indicates that what is
happening concerning aggregate demand is stronger than we would have expected  as a result
im a bit more optimistic than the greenbook in terms of what is going to happen next year with
aggregate demand  actually i see if anything a little more risk to the upside so i slant a bit in
that direction
the inflation numbers have been very good recently and one view is that they are just
temporary blips in the data  i tend to be a little more sanguine here because i think that there are
good reasons for inflation to gravitate toward what are solidly anchored inflation expectations
that has been very important in terms of the cycle and is one reason that im a little more
optimistic than the greenbook on inflation  i do think that inflation expectations are strongly
grounded around 2 percent on the pce deflator  as a result i expect us to go to 2 percent
inflation over the next year and then stay there but not go below there  i dont actually like to
think of this in terms of persistence  it is one reason that im unwilling to think that things will
get better than that  but i do think that we will likely have a more benign path of inflation than
we might have thought earlier
even if you think that theres a more benign path to inflation which im willing to
consider though were not sure about it it is still true that aggregate demand has blipped up
recently  that is an indication that the neutral real interest rate has moved up which is very
much reflected in the greenbook assessment  thats important because even if youre happy
about whats happening with inflation you have to be more worried about the fact that the
economy is going to be stronger  that does have some implications for the way we think about
policy going forward  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  this was an exceptionally interesting useful
discussion  i thought i would try to summarize what i heard around the table  if you have
comments on that please give them to me and then ill add a few comments of my own
members noted considerable economic strength during the intermeeting period  labor
markets remain taut with continuing wage pressures in some occupations  consumption grew
strongly in the fourth quarter with some momentum into the first quarter reflecting a strong job
market lower energy prices and higher profits  overall investment seems likely to grow at a
moderate pace given good fundamentals  business people seem generally optimistic and
financial markets are robust
we still have what people have been characterizing as a twotrack economy  housing
although a drag for now does show some tentative evidence of stabilization  however some
warned about drawing too strong a conclusion about housing during the winter months  some
also noted issues of credit quality  the general view was that housing would cease to subtract
from growth later this year  some softness in parts of manufacturing especially in industries
related to housing and automobiles still exists  but in part this weakness may be an inventory
correction that may be reasonably far advanced at this point  despite the weakness in housing
and some parts of manufacturing there are yet no signs of spillover into employment or
consumption although some raised the possibility that we may see those later on  some but not
all members agree with the contour of the greenbook that has economic growth somewhat
slower in the near term strengthening later this year with a modest increase in unemployment
the committee is generally more optimistic about potential growth than the greenbook mostly
because the members assume that labor force growth will be greater than the greenbook
assumes  overall downside risks to output appear to have moderated while an upside risk has
emerged that growth will not moderate as expected
on the inflation side people noted that recent readings have been favorable although
there was disagreement about the cause whether it was energy prices wellanchored inflation
expectations less structural inertia or perhaps just statistical noise  most still expect gradually
slowing inflation but are cautious and consider upside risk significant perhaps even greater than
late last year  the primary upside risk to inflation is economic growth above potential in tight
labor markets which may lead to inflation in the future if not in the near term  others noted that
inflation expectations may be too high to allow continued progress against inflation  so overall
the general tone was for a somewhat stronger economy perhaps a slightly improved outlook on
inflation but in any case a clear view that the upside risks to inflation are predominant  are
there any comments
let me add just a few points  everything has really been said but not everyone has said
it as they say  laughter  our goal has been in some sense to achieve a soft landing and the
question is whether we have missed the airport  laughter  we have seen a good bit of strength
in the intermeeting period and i think the real crux of the issue is whats going to happen to the
labor market  if the labor market continues where it is or strengthens further we will see both
stronger growth because of the income effects and job effects and continued pressure on
inflation  again the central issue will be whether we will see enough cooling in the economy to
have a bit of easing in the labor situation  this is obviously difficult to say  i do believe that
the most likely outcome for the first half of this year is for some moderation in growth perhaps
to modestly below potential  if you look at the various components of spending and production
you note for example that personal consumption expenditures are likely to slow from the very
high levels we have just seen recently  in particular a lot of the spending recently was for
durable goods which tend to be more negatively autocorrelatedthat is they tend to drop more
quickly when they are high in the short run  we have seen some moderation in investment in
both equipment and structures  net exports were a major contributor to growth at the end of the
year that should probably reverse as the greenbook notes  a special factor there is that the
good weather reduced oil imports which led people to spend on domestic production rather than
on foreign production  if that situation reverses and we go back to normal net exports that will
subtract from gdp  also the staff noted some likely reversals in government spending  so my
sense is that were likely to see something a little less hectic in the first half of this current year
i think it also remains reasonable that growth will return close to potential later this year
there is certainly uncertainty about that  clearly we have seen some signs of stabilization in the
housing market  i was going to note the effects of the winter months and the weather  i think
that we should acknowledge that stabilization but not ignore the possibility that we may see
further deterioration there
against the view that growth may moderate this quarter or next quarter perhaps there is
opposing evidence that consumption and employment are awfully strong  economists tend to
think of consumption in particular as being a very forwardlooking variable and its consistent
with views that we see for example in consumer sentiment that people do feel reasonably
optimistic about the labor market and about the state of the economy  so i agree that there is
certainly some risk that the economy will be stronger going forward than we have been
projecting  i dont have an answer other than to say that we obviously have to monitor the
situation very carefully and continue to be willing to reassess our views as the data arrive
let me say a bit about inflation  recent readings have been favorable  a couple of
aspects of inflation i do find encouraging  first is that the moderation weve seen in inflation the
past few months has happened despite the lack of any substantial moderation in shelter costs
owners equivalent rents are actually a constructed imputed variable  they are not seen by
anybody  nevertheless they are essentially the entire reason that inflation is remaining above
our target zone at this point  i know its a bit of a joke that i always refer to the shortterm
inflation numbers but ill do it again anyway  laughter  just to illustrate over the past three
months core cpi inflation excluding just owners equivalent rent was 02 percent at an annual
rate  over the past six months it was 120 percent at an annual rate  over the past twelve
months it was 182  we also get numbers for pce core inflation excluding owners equivalent
rents that are all below 2 percent  obviously that is just carving the data and there are lots of
problems with doing that  but to the extent we think that rents will continue to moderate and i
think there is scope for them to do that thats one factor that should make us a little more
comfortable  another factor is that there is a fairly broadbased slowing  i wont take a lot of
time to go through the evidence but particularly in the cpi there are some encouraging
developments on the services side in terms of inflation to go along with the slowing in goods
prices
now i am the first to acknowledge that lots of interpretations of the recent developments
are possible  we hope that favorable structural factors are at work  one possibility certainly is
that the wage increases are a catchup for previous productivity gains and that were seeing a
normal restoration of capitalincomelaborincome relationships  in that case this may be in
some sense a transitory adjustment that will restore those relationships and not necessarily
contribute to inflation going forward  another possibility is that energy price effects are
somewhat larger than we thought  there seems to be some evidence that they are  a third
possibility is that what we saw earlier last year was as governor kohn mentioned a transitory
upside some of which has simply passed and we are going back to the more fundamental rate of
inflation  so there are some structural reasons that inflation might be moderating
my having said that we should certainly acknowledge the statistical noise that is inherent
in these measures  the monthly standard deviation of core inflation in 2006 was about 8 basis
points  if the true underlying inflation is 02 percent then you have a very good chance of
getting either 03 or 01  therefore we and the financial markets ought to be braced for the
possibility that we will get 03i hope not worsein the next few months  i agree with the
view that has been expressed that the trend has not yet been established and well have to follow
its development  another very important point that has been raisedpresident moskow i think
was the first to raise itis that given the lags from economic activity to inflation that we see in
standard impulseresponse functions and so on these improvements may be real but nevertheless
temporary and the underlying labor market pressures and so on may lead to inflation problems a
year or eighteen months from now  i agree that it is a concern and it goes back to my point
earlier that we need to be very alert to changes in the pattern of aggregate demand going forward
as president poole mentioned one element that will help us is the endogeneity of financial
conditions  we havent done anything since the last meeting but longterm real interest rates
rose about 30 basis points  the yield curve is still inverted by about 30 basis points  so i think
even the markets themselves have the ability to raise real rates quite significantly enough
certainly to make a difference in the mortgage market if the data continue to be strong and if
inflation does not continue to subside  then we would have a bit more latitude as we try to
determine whether the fourth quarter was a blip or a trend  i think thats still an open question
so let me just say that i broadly agree with what i heard  the economy does look
stronger  that is an upside risk to which we need to be paying close attention  inflation looks a
bit better at least in the short term but there are some longterm considerations that we need to
keep in mind  finally the basic contours of the outlook are not sharply changed but i agree with
the sentiment around the table that upside risk to inflation remains the predominant concern that
the committee should have  are there comments  yes president poole
mr poole  we have two important pieces of information coming in at 830 tomorrow
morning  i hope the staff can give us a quick first read to start our meeting  i know that instant
analysis is risky but i ask for it anyway  laughter
mr stockton  and i will provide it  laughter  whether its worth anything or
not i dont know  laughter
chairman bernanke  well start the meeting with the data  anything else
theres a reception and dinner in dining room e  its for those who wish to attend  if you have
other plans please feel free to pursue them and well see you tomorrow morning at 900
meeting recessed
january 31 2007morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everyone  lets start with asking dave
stockton to report on this mornings data
mr stockton  so mr chairman this was sort of done on the fly  unlike the bea
i wont be able to go back and revise these remarks  laughter  total gdp this morning came
in at 3 percent  that was 09 percentage point stronger than we had forecast in the greenbook
there were really two sources of our miss in the fourth quarter  of that miss 05 was the net
export component which karen will speak about in a second and 04 was nonfarm inventory
investment  so perhaps karen will give the quick story on the net export side and then ill
complete the report
ms johnson  the net export numbers are based on trade data only for october
november and we each make an estimate of what december is going to be  perhaps half of our
miss or not quite half was due to differences of opinion about december  looking at what
theyve done for december we will take some information from that  some of what theyve put
in december is information that we didnt otherwise have  to some degree its statistical and
not really about trade  its something called a territorial adjustment  maybe a quarter is
differences about things in december for which we are not prepared to change our minds at this
point  so we would not go to as strong a positive contribution from net exports as they go
because we retain some difference of views about what the december numbers will turn out to
be  the other bit of news we received was very strong exports of services  well take that and
well probably give most of the adjustment but not quite all of it in the number we write down
next for q4  we will actually want to reverse that thing called territorial adjustment in q1  so
were actually going to make imports stronger and the net export contribution slightly more
negative in q1 as a result
mr stockton  thats basically half of our gdp miss  the other half is on the
inventory investment side  just like with karen about half of our miss on inventory investment
has to do with a difference of opinion about what the december book value figures will turn out
to be  so its just a difference between the beas estimate for december and our estimate for
december  i dont think wed be inclined to alter our december estimate so wed write off
roughly half of that miss on nonfarm inventory investment  we dont do that great a job of
forecasting those book value inventory figures either  it is not as though we have lots of
information or a good reason for staking ourselves to our forecast versus the beas but i dont
think they have any more information than we do  as for private domestic final purchases
which we have been emphasizing even given some of the recent noise in net exports and
government there we were in fact almost exactly right we were off by 4 basis points in terms
of its contribution to overall gdp  in terms of the composition consumption was a bit weaker
and equipment spending a bit stronger probably because of beas estimate of the share of autos
being sold to businesses versus households  so we dont really see very much information there
on net government was a bit weaker  the federal side was weaker by more than the state and
local side was stronger
ms minehan  what was the number for domestic final purchases dave
mr stockton  i actually dont know what the domestic final purchases were but if
you include the government which they do they were a little weaker than the number we had
written down
ms minehan  no the overall number
mr stockton  yes i dont know what the overall number is i know only what the
contributions are  well be able to get the overall number by break time  taking on board our
differences of opinion about the december figures wed probably be writing down with the
release in hand today a gdp estimate for the fourth quarter of about 3 percent rather than the
3 percent that is being currently publishedand in contrast to the 2 percent we wrote down
in the greenbook
so then the question is what does this imply about the overall momentum of activity
going into the first quarter  my answer has to be not much and i dont think this is just blind
stubbornness although im glad my wife is not here to dispute that particular characterization
laughter  but about the two surprisesas karen already indicated they would be inclined to
actually mark down their contribution of net exports to gdp growth in the first quarter on the
basis of the net export side  we would probably be inclined to do the same thing with respect to
the higher inventory investment and so were coming into the first quarter with somewhat higher
inventorysales ratios and maybe some indications that were not as far along in working down
inventories as we had thought  im glad that i dont actually have to write down that firstquarter
number today because we will have an employment report on friday and some first real readings
on the pace of activity in the first quarter by the end of the week and in the next week or two  so
basically id argue that there isnt a lot of signal in that 3 percent figure that were moving into
the first quarter with much thrust  another reason for not necessarily marking up activity as we
move into the first half of this year even though gdp came in 1 percentage point above our
estimates is that real disposable income actually came in 1 percentage point weaker than our
greenbook estimate  so it isnt as though with the higher growth rate of activity we have more
underlying growth in labor income that is likely to be spent going forward  we have an even
lower saving rate now in the fourth quarter than we have written down  thus i think there are
several reasons for not necessarily reading this as a sign of greater strength moving into the first
part of the year
on the inflation side things were actually spot on  total pce inflation was minus
08 percent  thats what we had written down in the greenbook  core pce was 21also
exactly what we had written down in the greenbook  marketbased core was 17 that was
actually 01 percentage point better than what we had written down in the greenbook  the other
major release this morning was the employment cost index which showed a yearoveryear
increase of 32 percent  that number also is exactly what we had written down in the
greenbook so i dont think we really see any difference  obviously the number has continued
to be very subdued  so in the totality on the inflation side things are looking very close to our
expectations and i think still pretty good  mr chairman thats all i have to say
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there any questions  if not vincent
mr reinhart3  thank you mr chairman  ill be referring to the handout material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  as noted in the top left panel of your first exhibit the path of policy expectations rotated up over the intermeeting period and investors now apparently anticipate the federal funds rate to move down only about  percentage point over the next couple of years  as related in the panel at the top right primary dealers are unanimous in expecting no change in the policy rate at this meeting  indeed nearly all the dealers believe that you will hold the funds rate steady through the may meeting  as to the wording of the statement some dealers are calling for a more upbeat assessment of the economic outlook but almost all expect no change in the committees assessment of risks  in the treasury market as shown in the bottom left panel this shift in policy expectations was associated with a rise of about  percentage point in nominal yieldsthe movement from the dotted to the solid black linesand a smaller increase in their real counterpartsthe dotted to the solid red lines  thus inflation compensation the vertical difference between the lines edged higher across maturities  according to the desk survey as in the table at the bottom right dealers marked up their outlook for real gdp growth and lowered their assessment of inflation for this year although the changes were small  if you examine the high frequency movements of the tenyear nominal yield about 20 basis points of the

3  material used by mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 3
increase was registered in windows around economic data releasesthats the red bar in the middle right panelsuggesting that the revisions to the growth outlook apparently predominated in shaping investors thinking about your nearterm behavior  federal reserve communicationsthe statement the minutes and speecheshad no net effect on yields  but as the gray bar shows a sizable portion of the rise in yields cannot be linked to data or other identifiable news releases  a similar measure of our ignorance in explaining yields comes from the arbitragefree models of the term structure that we regularly follow  those models not shown suggest that about  percentage point of the rise in the tenyear yield was due to an increase in the term premium
the same combination of a modestly higher track for activity and a lower one for inflation was a highlight of the simulations of the frbus model reported in the bluebook and repeated in exhibit 2  the trajectory of the nominal federal funds rate that best achieves your aimssubject to the many assumptions necessary to make this exercise workhas shifted up over much of the projection period whether you have an inflation goal of 1 percent or 2 percent  one consideration for the policy choice at this meeting is which charts in those two columns entice you  with a
2 percent inflation goal you can keep the funds rate unchanged for some time because you can very nearly declare victory at the prevailing level of inflation  in contrast to make progress toward a 1 percent inflation goal youve got a bit of work to do as the sluggishness of inflation expectations and the flatness of the phillips curve in the frbus model make it costly to disinflate  indeed this simulation puts the nominal federal funds rate around 6 percent by yearend
this observation on the inflation goal is mapped into two monetary policy alternatives at the top of exhibit 3  the quarterpoint firming of alternative c would be particularly attractive if besides having an inflation goal below the prevailing rate of inflation you harbored significant concerns about the underlying strength of aggregate demand and potential cost pressures  for instance you might view the recent string of favorable data on spending as suggesting upside prospects for aggregate demand perhaps along the lines of the buoyant consumer spending alternative simulation shown in the greenbook  the results of that exercise are plotted as the green lines in the middle panels for the federal funds rate the unemployment rate and core pce inflation respectively along with the baseline outcomes as black lines  with more pressure on resources and inflation running higher an estimated policy rule predicts a federal funds rate heading to 7 percent
another source of concern may be inflation expectations  inflation compensation derived from the treasury market plotted as the solid line in the bottom left panel for the next five years and the red line for the fiveyear fiveyearforward rate moved in a fairly wide range and rose a touch on net over the intermeeting period perhaps undercutting some of the claim that inflation expectations are well anchored
the case for holding the funds rate at 5 percent as under alternative b would be strengthened if you have an inflation goal of 2 percent  in addition the central tendencies of your forecasts for the unemployment rate and core pce inflation
reported in yesterdays chart show suggest that some of you believe that there is a more favorable tradeoff between the two than does the staff perhaps along the lines of the lower nairu alternative simulation in the greenbook the red lines in the middle panels  even if you viewed inflation running at or above 2 percent as uncomfortable downside risks to employment and growth especially given the uncertainties surrounding the ongoing housing market correction and possible spillovers to other components of spending may tip the balance toward keeping the funds rate unchanged for now  if those risks do not materialize the same process in financial markets that operated over the recent intermeeting period will likely operate in the future as president poole and chairman bernanke noted yesterday  that is with market expectations of the funds rate still tilted down as plotted by the dashed line in the bottom right panel yields will back up further as investors come to realize that policy easing will not be forthcoming adding to financial restraint  also note that marketbased confidence bands surrounding investors expectations derived from interestrate caps and shown by the blue fan chart are narrow in the near term but then widen markedly  thus market participants see ample scope for policy actionin either directionin coming quarters
the last exhibit gives the latest version of table 1 which circulated monday  it trims the wording of alternative b to be a little more upbeat about firmer economic growth in section 2 which feels right this morning  i also hope that you might reflect on the risk assessment offered in section 4 of alternative c  the language about policy firming that youve repeated for the past few meetings seems a little stale and potentially misleading if you are not confident that your next policy action will be to tighten  talking about the relative odds of action might be a more durable structure but this might be a discussion for a later day out of concern about an inappropriate reaction in financial markets today
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for vincent  vice
chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  this is more an observation than it is a question  i
guess im a little uncomfortable the way you framed just in the paper exhibit 3 in the sense that
i dont think it would be great if we came to view alternative b in the statement as in a sense
validating a higher implicit inflation objective than members of the committee heretofore talked
about  it is true that with the stance of policy implied in markets today under reasonable
assumptions you may not get below 2 percent any time soon  but if you have different
assumptions about the structure of the economy about the way inflation works in this economy
or different views about the period thats optimal for bringing inflation down its plausible that
you could have a forecast that gets inflation below 2 percent with the stance of policy not
dramatically different from whats in the greenbook  i know that you didnt mean to imply that
but i dont think it would be good for us to create a sense of validating the monetary policy
expectations that are in the markets or in the greenbook  we would be accepting that we have
allowed our implicit objective to drift up
mr reinhart  you probably wont have that trouble in public because among the
things that will be released is your central tendency forecast and it does have a steeper decline in
core pce inflation than the staffs forecast does  so keeping policy unchanged at this meeting
does not validate a 2 percent inflation goal it just means you might have a different view
chairman bernanke  were ready to begin our policy goround  president
plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  ill start off by saying that today i favor
maintaining the federal funds rate at 5 percent  as we discussed yesterday and we learned this
morning the picture that seems to be emerging from the latest economic information is one of
reasonably strong underlying growth which has been temporarily weakened by housing and
autos  given that temporary weakness i think it would be premature to raise rates today but i
am not confident that core inflation will continue to decelerate in the coming quarters and that
could risk our credibility  the level of inflation continues to be higher than id like to see and in
my forecast we may not see a return to price stability unless monetary conditions are tightened
further  although i dont think today is the day to do it i do want us to consider tightening if we
see growth accelerating back to trend more quickly than in the greenbook  i say this not because
i think that growth will put upward pressure on inflation but because the associated equilibrium
real rates that are implied by that higher growth which we are beginning to see in the
marketplace will eventually force our hand  as i mentioned in my remarks on the economy at
the past two meetings i have been of the mind that a somewhat slower economy combined with
a constant funds rate might be sufficient to ensure a decline in core inflation  as the economy
strengthens that scenario becomes a little less likely  if the economy continues to strengthen a
failure to act not only puts our price stability goal at risk but also risks our credibility with the
public
thus it would be illadvised to suggest in our statement that we are finished acting for a
while and therefore i would not favor the language that bill poole circulated last week  my
preference is for the language describing the rationale given in alternative c in table 1 of the
bluebook  the rationale in alternative c including both sections 2 and 3 is really not more
hawkish than the language of alternative b yet its more concise and comes closer to my views
on the current state of the economy  indeed since under alternative b section 3 or alternative
c section 3 we would be making sizable changes in the language from our last statement i also
think that its appropriate at this time to purge the language about the high level of resource
utilization having the potential to sustain inflation pressures or lower oil prices to mitigate core
inflation  all the recent work on the forecasting of mediumterm and longerterm inflation that i
have seen says that these phillipstype models dont help us forecast core inflation very well
the frbus model of the greenbook looks as though it has very flat tradeoffs certainly in the
near term anyway so i think it would be useful to change our language at this point  i have not
been a fan of that language but in the past i was persuaded that we should leave it so as to avoid
unnecessary changes that might confuse the public  but since we are considering changes at this
time i would favor going with alternative c which gets rid of this language  im happy to
continue with the risk assessment that we had last time eliminating the word nonetheless
although frankly i would not greatly resist actually going with the assessment of risk in
alternative c  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president plosser just so im clear which sections from c
mr plosser  i advocate leaving the federal funds rate section as is but using sections
2 and 3 from alternative c as our rationale
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you very much mr chairman  i too am in favor of
maintaining policy at its current level  i find myself somewhere between policy alternatives c
and b as described in exhibit 3 leaving out as vice chairman geithner suggested any
commitment to either of those goals  i am concerned about housing and the possible spillovers
however the underlying pace of growth and activity within the economy does risk taking
inflation up from where we think its going to go changing the path of it slightly  the chairman
and a couple of other people mentioned yesterday the uptick in mediumterm to longterm bonds
a good point to be made here is that most of the action in the markets has resulted from the
release of economic data  given at least the surface gloss of the gdp report i imagine that the
markets will be firmer rather than softer will expect less movement on our part and could move
up at the long end and create some lessening of financial accommodation in effect making
financial terms a bit more restrictive  so i think we will get some help from the market reaction
to the current economic data  those things togethermy continuing concern about the housing
situation though i think it is stabilizing and a bit tighter markets than perhaps we expected
tend to weigh in my mind against my concern that the inflation path in our forecast will not be
realized  so i am content for the time being with alternative b  as i said in my comments
yesterday if we continue to see the same pattern of things sooner rather than later we may have
to contemplate to manage the risks in the economy an upward movement in monetary policy
but i would not suggest that for today
turning to the language i suggested a couple of days ago that we use section 2 from
alternative c  there have been some modifications to section 2 in alternative b  i am okay with
those but i continue to believe as does president plosser that section 2 in alternative c is a bit
cleaner a bit shorter and a bit more reflective overall as to the way i see things  but i could go
with either b or c at this point  vince mentioned that we might want to think about section 4
the assessment of risks  i had made a recommendation there as wellone somewhat similar to
what he was implying we might want to think about in terms of the committees judging that
inflation remains a predominant concern  i think thats a little stronger than the committee
judges that some inflation risks remain  i would take the remaining phrase of that sentence
outabout nearterm policy firming being more likely than policy easingas i think that might
be a big shock  but changing the language to inflation remains the predominant concern and
then picking up with future policy adjustments would make a small change to the inflation risk
section would focus people a bit more firmly on that and would be a step in the right direction
of cautioning the markets about the possibility though perhaps not very high yet that our next
move might be up rather than flat for a long period or down
so just to sum up i am okay with alternative b section 2  id prefer section 2 from
alternative c but im okay with b  i would make a change in the assessment of risks  i can live
with it the way it is but i think the alternative c change that i have recommended is a little
cleaner and moves in the direction that vince was talking about
chairman bernanke  president minehan for the risk assessment in alternative c
are you proposing also the second sentence
ms minehan  yes just taking out the phrase from and to easing  the
committee judges that inflation remains a predominant concern  future policy adjustments will
depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by
incoming information
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president barron
mr barron  thank you mr chairman  let me say at the outset that i was truly
impressed with your summary of everyones comments yesterday  if i had known that you were
listening so intently i might have scrutinized my own comments a little more  laughter  many
participants as you summarized reported an improved outlook in housing and perhaps to a
lesser extent an improved outlook for inflation  to play off our immediate past chairmans
phrase i think it might be appropriate to guard against what i might call premature exuberance
on both fronts with regard to the bottoming out of housing and the improvement in inflation  i
dont think we gain much at this point in the business cycle by declaring victory on the housing
front and i didnt hear anyone say that  but i think we have to be cautious in our comments as it
could well prove to be a drag going forward
for the overall economy my own take is that we have more upside potential than perhaps
we have seen so far putting aside this mornings report  corporate balance sheets remain
extremely strong  although i do not anticipate that profits in 2007 will match the levels that we
saw in 2006 i see no reason that they would drop below trend and perhaps they will even come
in above trend  with that as a backdrop the job outlook might even be brighter than weve
discussed  if the job market remains firm i would have every reason to believe that the level of
participation outlined in the greenbook might be understated and so we could well have more
positive income effect from the consumer going forward than weve witnessed or that we are
thinking of for the future  a final point relates to exports  yesterday evening i looked back over
the information we had with regard to the consistency of a high level of performance of all the
economies of the world  i couldnt find a time in which we had all the economies of the world
performing at the level they are today  if you take that into consideration and put aside as dave
so eloquently noted the special factors that we had in the fourth quarter in exports we could
well see a more positive effect going forward in net exports
on balance though i still have a concern that the effect of housing going forward will be
a drag  however i fully anticipate that at the national level at least we will be able to bounce
back in the second half  if we do bounce back in the second half in housing then gdp growth
could well exceed what we are forecasting now  all of that said im very comfortable with the
current stance of policy  im not going to try to wordsmith on the fly  my own bias is to be
somewhat supportive of alternative b as presented this morning  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman im very comfortable with alternative b as far as the rate
goes  given what we dont know today i think thats exactly where we ought to be  we will
know more over the next six months about how that should be adjusted as we move forward  on
the language i feel that we would be better served with sections 2 and 3 of alternative c  that
language describes my own views and much of what i heard yesterday especially as it says
seems to be rebounding and some tentative signs of stabilization  going forward the
economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace is good language  then more important i
would like to see in section 3 that readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent
months but remain elevated  going forward that is the essential issue i think we have to watch
besides the economy  thats why i believe that language is preferable  the risk assessment as
described in alternative b is fine  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  may i ask a clarifying question  its not actually clear
to me really that alternative c section 3the inflation sectionis more hawkish than
alternative b
mr hoenig  its not
vice chairman geithner  so you were speaking in its favor not because it is
more hawkish but for what reason
mr hoenig  because it describes what is and that is that inflation is elevated
vice chairman geithner  my concern is that as the chairman has said if you
look at the threemonth annualized rate for a whole bunch of measures of core elevated might
be overstating it a bit
mr hoenig  it isnt to me because 26 year over year is elevated
chairman bernanke  the original intention was to capture the last relatively few
monthly readings so there is a bit of ambiguity there
mr hoenig  my point is that what youre describing is the systematic move down
and the margin is bringing the average down and thats what you say  readings on core
inflation have improved modestly in recent months but remain elevated  so long as we can
convey that i think the markets will read us more properly because even though the threemonth
may be coming down its still 26 percent year over year rather than where i thought last june it
would be which was 24  so it has improved but were not to where we need to be and thats
my point
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i was a bit loquacious yesterday and apparently for some
too anecdotally explicit if not excessive  laughter  so ill be less frisky this morning shorter
and more to the point  i support alternative b  i dont want to wordsmith it  the only word i
would want to add which i wont get is worldwide which i would insert after resource
utilization  thats a reality and thats my recommendation mr chairman  thank you  im
sorry if i took too much time
chairman bernanke  no problem president fisher  thank you  president
yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i support bluebook alternative b  i think we
should maintain the current stance of policy because it is likely to foster an economy that
gradually moves toward a soft landing  at the same time the upward bias in the risk assessment
is consistent with my view that upside risks do predominate for both growth and inflation  my
best guess still is that this years growth will be slightly below trend with the current stance of
policy  but as i indicated yesterday for me the risks have shifted more to the upside given
recent news  housing remains a concern but i think the prospects for a really serious housing
collapse that spreads to consumer spending have diminished substantially  i am focused as i
said yesterday on upside risks to activity possibly coming from consumer spending  on the
inflation front the news has been good and i continue to think for a variety of reasons including
my views on persistence that core inflation will edge down over the year but clearly it is too
soon to conclude that a new trend has set in  to me the upside risk to inflation seems palpable
especially because labor markets have tightened  although i agree with president plosser that
the phillips curve has certainly appeared to flatten in recent years most estimates that i have
seen of phillips curves suggest that the relationship between changes in unemployment and
changes in inflation even though it may have become smaller is still significant  the lags may
be long so that its effect might not show up very much over the next couple of years but it is a
significant source of longterm risk
im pleased with the language suggested for alternative b  i think it effectively updates
developments since our last meeting and i favor keeping the same wording on the risk
assessment that we used last time  that wording still conveys a sense of upside bias  i dont see
a compelling reason to change and i think it still works
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i support no change in the federal funds
rate today  from our comments yesterday it appears that not much has changed in terms of our
outlook for growth and inflation  so id prefer to make only the changes to our statement that
are necessary to keep us current with the intermeeting data reports  im comfortable with the
language in alternative b  it updates what weve heard in terms of the current reports  however
i also agree with vincents comment that our language in our assessment of risk has become
stale  i felt that way in december  but were not operating with a clean slate and any
significant changes to the language today are probably going to be interpreted as an attempt to
signal some significant change in our outlook or risks to that outlook  so i agree that today is not
the day to do that but i hope that well have some further discussion about how to use some
language in our statements that is more durable  for now alternative b looks right to me  i have
one final comment  for the record i agree with vice chairman geithners comment about not
interpreting our actions today or our thought about the path for the fed funds rate as a suggestion
that we have a different objective on inflation  i think that vice chairman geithner made a good
point and i want to support it  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president minehan
ms minehan  just an interjectioni would also like to be on record as not assuming
that the committee has an explicit objective  individuals around the table have indicated
comfort zones of one range or another but as far as i know the committee has no explicit
objective  we all want to have the best policy we can for inflation and growth in a given period
vice chairman geithner  i tried to qualify my comment with as many qualifiers
as i could  i didnt mean to imply that the committee had an implicit objective
ms minehan  thank you
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  i agree  i was commenting on my own outlook  because of some of
the differing assumptions that we talked about yesterday i just didnt want to be in the camp of a
2 percent objective
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i agree with the sense of the committee
that we should not be raising rates today  however i do think that as weve all said the
inflation risks still dominate and that were approaching some very important decision points in
the next couple of meetings  if we look back of course the primary risk to our growth forecast
has been housing  we have seen an incredibly sharp decline and many of us have the sense that
housing is stabilizing now  theres still some uncertainty about that but it seems to be
stabilizing  once it stabilizes our attention will shift to the other part of our dual mandateto
price stability  as i think we have all said were uncomfortable with the current rate of
inflation  there has been some improvement well take that to the bank  were happy with
that  but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the future course of inflation and the projections
in the greenbook and the bluebook are not encouraging to me  my comfort zone is 1 to 2
percent so im in the 1 percent category  in view of that range as vince said we have work to
do  i agree with tim and sandy that we shouldnt interpret alternative b as saying that each
individual has a target of 2 percent  our projection for inflation is 2 percent in both years and
that is clearly above that target  we have said were concerned about inflationwe said that last
time and i think it was well put  but we should make even stronger statements in the minutes
about the costs of inflation running above forecast and about the damage it can do to the
economy on a longterm basis  as i said i dont think we have the luxury of waiting until
inflation rises before we act  we have to be forwardlooking  the next couple of meetings are
going to be important because well know a lot more about whether housing really has stabilized
further and what the inflation numbers will look like  in terms of the language im comfortable
with alternative b as its stated  i like the reference to the high level of resource utilization in
section 3 so i would not change the language at this time
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  as i commented yesterday it seems to me that
developments in terms of both real growth and core inflation have been positive recently and i
would say the same thing about the outlook  against that background i think that maintaining
the federal funds rate as in alternative b is the appropriate policy decision  im willing to be
patient to see how much disinflation we get from here  but i guess my patience isnt infinite
and so at some point if we dont get any more than is anticipated in the greenbook were going
to have to consider further action  but at the moment thats not a principal concern of mine  so
thats my judgment about the stance of policy for now
as far as the language is concerned i have a preference for sections 2 and 3 from
alternative c  i find those more appropriate than the expressions under alternative b  as far as
section 4 is concerned there could be a case for some abbreviated version along the lines that
president minehan suggested  alternative b section 4 has really served us well overall and so
my judgment is that at this point its not worth trying to change that language  so i would
recommend marrying sections 2 and 3 from alternative c with section 4 from b as being about as
good as we can do at the moment
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  by way of prefacei didnt mention this
yesterday but my semiannual forecast projects core pce inflation falling to 16 for 08 and
growth rising from 26 to 29 in 08  this represents both a morerapid return to price stability
and a higher rate of trend growth than provided in the greenbook  my forecast takes seriously
the instruction to assume appropriate monetary policy perhaps more seriously than i have taken
it in the past  i think it is likely to require that the policy be more aggressive than assumed in the
greenbook and that communications be forceful about our intentions to bring inflation down  i
think the forecast that i have submitted is both feasible and desirable because i think we dont
need to use the output gap as our sole means of hammering inflation expectations and we dont
need to wait nearly a decade as in the bluebook simulations
although i believe that the appropriate policy is likely to require a higher funds rate path
at some point this year im not too uncomfortable leaving it unchanged today  i welcome the
recent good news on core inflation and like president stern im willing to wait and see whether
the good news continues  however i have been disturbed over the past year and a half as i have
told you about the extent to which shortrun core inflation and longerrun inflation expectations
appear to be sensitive to energy price movements  we appear to have conditioned people to
expect core inflation to rise whenever energy prices surge  this will pose a problem for us if
energy prices rise substantially or if the current lull in core inflation proves to be only the
transitory effect from the recent fall in energy prices  both hypotheses seem reasonably
plausible to me for the coming year or two  so i believe as president moskow and others have
said that were likely to face another inflation challenge later this year  i think it would help our
cause if our policy moves were coupled with better communications but that is a discussion for
later today  for now im prepared to support standing pat
i agree with president plosser and others around the table who prefer the language in
alternative c for sections 2 and 3  i also agree with president minehan about the language in
alternative c for section 4  i think that i read predominant concern as a little stronger and
better calibrated to our viewsor at least my viewsthan the language in b  i also agree
strongly with vice chairman geithner that standing pat today doesnt imply a 2 percent target
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner im not sure i understand jeff  with regard to
section 4 what is your preference
mr lacker  president minehans suggestion
chairman bernanke  yes president minehan
ms minehan  this is the problem with editing on the fly  i had recommended that
you go directly from the committee judges that inflation remains the predominant concern to
the next sentencefuture policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for
both inflation and economic growthand so on  however leaving out the phrase that is in
alternative b now in section 4the extent and timing of additional firming that may be needed
to address those risksactually does make that sentence of section 4 of alternative c somewhat
weaker than alternative b  im getting ready to take my suggestion off the table laughter
because i think that you may be on to something with alternative b and it may be better to leave
it that way because it does suggest additional firming as opposed to leaving it open
mr lacker  its a fair point  id agree with that
ms minehan  i take my suggestion off the table
mr lacker  i withdraw my support for your previous suggestion  laughter
chairman bernanke  you cant withdraw it shes not making it  laughter
president lacker please just say a word about how we are linking energy prices and core  in our
public remarksfor example my speeches on energyi have talked about the importance of
unlinking those two
mr lacker  yes indeed  but if you just plot the two for the past year and a half you
see a kind of twomonth or threemonth echo into the core  you calculate the cross correlations
they were pretty high before 1984 they were low from 1984 to 2001  theyve been high again
since  my reading of the financial press coverage of macroeconomic conditions following the
hurricanes in late 05 is that we saw a sudden burst of references to the macroeconomic
conditions of the 1970s  i suspectit is hard to disprove this one way or anotherthat rhetoric
harkening back to slowing growth and energy prices causing higher inflation induced in the
publics mind a sense that when energy prices surge growth is going to be lower  you saw the
policy path come down in september of 05 and youre going to see higher core inflation and
thats what we saw that fall  to some extent we tried to speak strongly of our desire to hold
inflation down but in hindsight we left that association in the publics mind  so i just think this
is a conditionality that appears now to have been built into expectations
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner has a twohander
mr kroszner  a twohander on the nowdisgraced proposal on section 4
laughter  i think the way to raise it back is just take the phrase the committee judges that
inflation remains the predominant concern and then move on to the sentence in alternative b
that starts with the extent and timing of any additional firming
ms minehan  we could definitely do that
mr kroszner  if you want to keep it i think thats the way to bring it back to grace
chairman bernanke  president moskow has an intervention
mr moskow  i was going to make exactly the same suggestionto put it on the table
for consideration by president minehan  laughter
mr kroszner  it also has the virtue of minimizing the number of word changes and
just substituting a phrase from the minutes from last time for those of you who think thats the
best way to go
chairman bernanke  but i just raise a question for those who are making the
suggestion because id like to hear your response  in saying that inflation is the predominant
concern we are acknowledging more explicitly than we have before that we have other concerns
that is were in some sense bringing into the assessment the presumption that there are concerns
other than inflation but we are perhaps more concerned about housing than we were before
this is simply a semantic issue  in alternative b we dont acknowledge other concerns  neither
of these things is quite accurate i agree  i just wanted to point that out and ask for your
response  president lacker
mr lacker  i think several of us have used the predominant concern language so i
dont see it as likely to induce a dramatic change in assessment about our views
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  the language that we have had for some time has shown concern about
cooling as a result of the housing market  whether we have explicitly referred to it as a concern
or not clearly it has been a concern  i think that predominant concern is a bit stronger than
some inflationary risks remain and that such language correctly reflects the sense of the people
around the table  now it may be too much  i dont want to speak for tim but at one point he
thought it was too much
vice chairman geithner  well no id just make the observation that we
debated this before and we debated several times the question about whether the best
introductory phrase to that balance of risk assessment was exactly that language  the problem in
doing it nowthis is just one mans viewis that i think it will be read as a significant
alteration of our signal and on the strength of what weve discussed about changes to the
outlook in december we cant justify a significant change in the signal  the second reason not
to do it is the one that the chairman raised  it introduces a slightly infelicitous framing when
there is some risk that people will read everything we say through the prism of whether were in
the midst of altering implicitly the hierarchy of objectives that we have as a committee in some
broad sense  thats not the way you framed it mr chairman
chairman bernanke  i couldnt have framed it that way  laughter
vice chairman geithner  but i think we havent changed our view of the
outlook enough to justify that significant a change in the signal
chairman bernanke  intervention president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i think we have to do this against the background of what we
said the last time  if you go back to section 2 from december we were cautious about growth  in
section 2 under alternative b now were basically saying that we are seeing firmer economic
growth  i dont want to overdo this and i think vice chairman geithners point is absolutely
correct here  lets think of where were coming from and indicate the reality of what weve talked
about  we are concerned about inflation  using the word predominant excessively emphasizes
our concern  at some point we may need to tighten but lets think of this as the migration from
where we were in december  i think the migration is adequately captured in the language that we
have in alternative b
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  let me also support tim on this  i have a slightly different slant here
which is that the inflation numbers have actually come in better  the concern here is that the
economy is coming in stronger and that it may necessitate tightening  but we dont want to give the
impression that we think the inflation numbers are worse and thats the big problem  its really a
perspective about going forward and thats an additional reason for not changing the language in
this case
chairman bernanke  vincent
mr reinhart  may i just make one observation mr chairman  when you move from
b4 to c4 you make another change as well  b4 talks about inflation risks whereas c4 talks
about inflation  so you are changing  youre actually indicating distaste for the current level of
inflation whereas the previous one could be read as oh there could be outcomes that are on the
high side
mr lacker  alternative c section 3 does the same thing
ms minehan  thats a good point
chairman bernanke  any other interventions
mr hoenig  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  just to clarify im assuming then were floating back toward alternative b
leaving the fourth section as is
chairman bernanke  oh you can speak for yourself  laughter
mr hoenig  oh i like that but im not sure thats where we landed laughter
chairman bernanke  okay  i think were going to have to assert order here  any
other interventions  president moskow
mr moskow  i would just say that im comfortable with going back to alternative b
section 4 but one way to help move this forward would be just to strengthen our concern in the
minutes about inflation and stick with b4
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  first of all i do favor an unchanged fed funds
rate target  i prefer sections 2 and 3 from alternative c  as i read the conversation around the table
i dont hear anyone saying that we need to prime the markets for a probable increase in the fed
funds rate in march  possibly in june is my sense probably later if we get bad news on inflation
and a stronger economy than anticipated
i went back in the statements to when we started working on this language  this language
really dates from march or pretty close to it  in march we said some further policy firming may
be needed  then in may we said some further policy firming may yet be needed  in june we
said the extent and timing of any additional firming    that may be needed  i think that when
we started this language we had the sense that we were on the edge of needing additional
tightening  certainly the pause in august was not as i recall it viewed as necessarily permanent
we called it a pause we didnt call it a stop  i had the sense in august and september that if we
had had continuing escalation of inflation we were ready to move higher  we were saying that our
best guess was that we were going to hang where we were but that we might be on the edge of
tightening  that was my sense at the time and i think thats the way the market read it  over the
succeeding months conditions changed a lot  the economy came in for a while softer than
anticipated  housing was in a deeper decline than we thought  inflation numbers came in on the
favorable sidenot dramatically better but certainly it was a favorable development  so the policy
meaning of the language has changed as a consequence of the evolution from the time we first
adopted it
we need to view the language in terms of how lets say a graduate student five years from
now looking at the transcript will read the discussion around the table  he or she will say that in
december probably october but certainly in december and at this meeting the committee was not
on the edge of signaling an increase to the market  thats the problem with section 4 in alternative
c  its a fairly clear indication that we seriously want to signal the market that were on the edge of
raising the rates in march and i just dont think thats where we are  so i think that we need to
view the language in terms not only of the current situation but also of its evolution and several
people have commented that of course we are where we are  this is an ideal time to move away
from that language because the market commentary is very much in the direction of expecting that
the committee is going to hold the rate constant for some time  thats in the market commentary
thats in the futures markets  there wont be an easier time to move away from this language than
right now and that was the purpose of the memo that i distributed  i would really like to see us get
back toward the english language meaning of the words rather than the inherited policy meaning
that this has come to have as a consequence of its repetition
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor bies
ms bies  thank you mr chairman  i favor keeping rates unchanged today and i favor
the language in alternative b in all the sections  trying to be cautious looking at the numbers that
just came out and reflecting back to yesterdays discussion about the nairu last night i looked
some more at the exhibit 5 that the staff presented yesterday  i looked at the bottom right panel
which shows the labor force participation rate of those over 62  there are a lot of us baby boomers
and were generally healthy folks and it really is unclear what were going to do  the baby
boomers have changed participation in the labor force throughout our generation  we were the
generation that brought women into the labor force  we now are going to live twenty years after
age 65 and were not going to sit idle because were going to be healthier and we have a lot of
skills  the additional skill set that we have could actually mitigate the shortage of some skilled
workers  folks probably want more flexibility  they dont want to be on a payroll but they may
want to take a job now and then or work on a contract  whatever historical nairu patterns we
have they are going to be tested by the changing labor force participation due to the baby boomers
thats a big unknown but it clearly affects potential growth the output gap and inflation pressures
so i really dont want to signal anything  this will play out over a long period but it is the reason
when i look at the lower nairu alternative scenario in the greenbook that i read it as higher
participation rate and i want to be cautious  thats why i cant go to alternative c  i dont want to
signal as much worry about inflation  i also want to be careful that we dont go as strong as calling
something rebounding because i dont want people to think were going to go back to mid3
percent growth rates with housing still as soft as it is on a sustained basis  we do still need to watch
housing  the strong job market will put legs under the growth side of this and i like the changes
that were made in section 2  i think firmer growth is exactly what we want to talk about so i like
the tone that weve set in the changes in b
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like the others i favor maintaining the federal
funds rate at its current level today  as president plosser pointed out the strength of the data on
employment and spending does imply a higher natural real rate  at the same time the inflation data
have come in really more favorable than we expected and have pointed to the moderation that weve
all been hoping for  todays information confirmed that the pce was as low as the staff had
thought it was going to be in the fourth quarter and that at least by the most comprehensive
compensation measure we have the pickup in compensation remains very very damped and might
even be consistent with a lower nairu than is built into the staff forecast  so balancing these two
i think were right where we are  vice chairman geithner said something yesterday about being
patient and i think we can be patient at least for a little while longer  at the same time i agree with
everyone else as i said yesterday that the strength in demand the low unemployment rate and the
sluggish rise in productivity suggest that there are upside risks to the further moderate decline in
inflation that were all seeking
on the language id prefer alternative b up and down and let me give some reactions to the
others  i have the same issue with section 2 that governor bies just mentioned  it seems to me that
the word rebounding particularly after we just published a 3 percent q4 might imply that this
is a process that is continuing  the staffs projection is that if anything they would write q1 down
a bit  i dont know how people would read the word rebounding it might have more of a sense of
continuing strength than we see  thats why i like the changes that were made to alternative b  it is
now a little more backwardlooking  recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic
growth  thats kind of what we know  we are also projecting in a general way moderate growth
going forward  the word rebounding in section 2 has a little more momentum than i am
comfortable with
on section 3 if we went to alternative c we would need to be clear that we are talking
about twelvemonth inflation that remains elevated and thats 23 percent on the core pce  if we
used that first sentence we would need to get a little more technical than we usually get in the
announcement and say improved modestly in recent months but remained elevated on a twelve
month basis so as not to confuse people about the recent months  that consideration makes me
favor sticking with alternative b  i do think the high level of resource utilization is at the foundation
of my concerns about the inflation risk  it means that labor and product markets are fairly tight and
if there are increases in cost businesses will more easily pass them through  so i like keeping that
reference to resource utilization in section 3  it gives a little flavora rationalefor why were
worried about the inflation process and i would prefer to keep that rationale in there
on the risk assessment id stick with where we are  i dont think anyone misunderstands
what were doing  it is less stale in some sense than it was in decemberlaughter in december i
had my doubts because we really were more worried about the downside risk to output  its more
indicative of where we are today than it was in december  with regard to president pooles point it
does say the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed so it leaves open the
possibility that it isnt the next meeting that it might be another meeting  i disagree with vincents
point that somehow it gives us a sense that were more certain that were going to need to tighten
than we really are  it just says any additional firming that may be needed so i dont think it says
were definitely going to firm  the market understands what we mean  the markets reaction to
incoming data over the intermeeting period has been very constructive  were not saying anything
thats getting in the way of the stabilizing properties of the markets and on section 4 id leave well
enough alone  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me spend a minute talking about a market
issue before turning to the language  weve talked a bit and vincent talked a bit about option
implied measures of uncertainty about the policy path which are near historical lows  thats
certainly the case now and it was the case when we last met  even though the expected path of
policy and market prices have moved much closer to our own in the past two months its as though
the markets are sayingto be a touch glibalways certain rarely right  i would have thought
that we would have seen market uncertainty about the policy path change along with their view that
we were going to take lessdramatic action over the past six weeks  that tells me that market
measures of uncertainty may not be altogether accurate here and thats a troubling sign as we try to
figure out whether they are really telling us about uncertainty or whether they are a separate bet
unrelated to our future policy actions
today i too favor maintaining the federal funds rate target and i generally share the views
expressed in alternative b  as governor kohn suggests the jump from mixed to rebounding as
the operative word suggests a reaction to the data that strikes me as somewhat more positive at the
same time that my own sense hasnt changed dramatically over the past six weeks  while the
markets seem to have moved dramatically we have really been a rock in this process  the markets
have come closer to us and so id rather not appear overly reactive to some very recent data
with respect to section 4 i was concerned at one point that the words the committee
judges that some inflation risks remain seemed a little too dovish  through the minutes and the
speeches of our colleagues that wording has come to mean exactly that inflation is more of a
concern than anything else  so in some ways it has become ossified but true and so i dont see the
benefit of going to alternative c  with that i generally support alternative b and suspect that we
shouldnt be making many more dramatic changes than that
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you  i too support alternative b and maintaining the federal
funds rate at 525 percent  i agree with many of the arguments that were made before and so i
wont repeat them  ill go to the language  on section 2 i think it would be an overreaction or
appear to be an overreaction to the current data if we suddenly went from where we were to
rebounding  governor kohn suggested that rebounding has problematic implications for going
forward  that is particularly true if we think that at least 05 percentage point of the 35 percent will
be taken away in revisions  alternative b very nicely encompasses that even if we didnt know that
the number would be a bit firmer than we expected  i also think that in section 3 its problematic to
use the words in recent months but remain elevated because in recent months core inflation hasnt
been elevated it looks as though the numbers have been fairly consistently below 2 and so fairly
consistently below where they had been six or twelve months ago on average  that wording gives a
misleading impression  in section 4 even though i had suggested that alternative i did so really to
clarify the discussion because i thought some of the discussion was not focusing on the issue but on
some of the wording though we had a very good discussion  i have been and remain in favor of not
changing the language mainly because the markets seem to have learned to interpret it the way we
think would be appropriate  exactly as governor kohn said the market is reacting to the data in a
very sensible way given our perspective on the likely evolution of the data  since they seem to be
kind of getting the data and the perspective on what were likely to do right it would seem to be an
inopportune time to change the language  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i have a slightly different take on where the economy is in that i think the
inflation numbers we have seen recently are likely to be reflecting something thats actually
happening  so im a little more sanguine on the inflation front than i was before and than the
greenbook is  i dont see inflation risks on the upside which is the way many people describe the
situation partially because i think were going to do our job properly but i am a little concerned
about giving that impression outside  however i worry about the upside risk for output  in that
context the implication is that we should think about some upward bias to the future path of the
federal funds rate  clearly a change in the federal funds rate is not needed today  thats no
surprise and i think were all agreed on that  however we have a situation in which the real
interest rate that will be appropriate in terms of keeping inflation from rising has certainly gone up
in that sense we are more likely to raise rates in the future as a result of whats happened recently
in terms of the language i am a bit mixed about section 2  i lean toward a little stronger
language and therefore was leaning a little toward using alternative c for section 2  but i worry a
bit about the word rebounding so im not sure  section 2 in alternative b is fine with me as
wella little mix there  i feel strongly that we not move to section 3 in alternative c because it
gives the impression that the inflation risks have gone up whereas the real side is more of a concern
to me  that concern relates as well to my view of section 4 for which i again strongly support
alternative b  the issue here is not so much that inflation risks right now are the problem but that
output may be stronger than we expect which means that to keep inflation under control we will
have to raise rates in the future  again for that reason i strongly support alternative b for section 4
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  mr vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  the most important thing for
us to do today and its really the only thing we need to do is to convey a sense that on the basis of
recent data we see somewhat less downside risk to growth and maybe somewhat less upside risk to
inflation  but the principal issue we face is whether were going to see inflation come down far
enough with the current constellation of financial conditions which weve helped induce  thats
the issue that we will be debating for some time  its possible maybe probable that we will have to
tighten further but we dont know that yet  i dont think we need to change our basic signal about
the probability that were going to have to tighten more and im very comfortable with the
language in alternative b  of course all the alternatives are flawed  alternative b seems the least
flawed among the alternatives  an interesting question is whether referring to current core inflation
as elevated today is helpful  you could amend b3 to say although core inflation remains
elevated recent readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months  but you
cant really do that without doing what don suggestedthat is distinguishing more clearly between
a twelvemonth and a threemonth rateand its hard to argue that doing so is really worthwhile
so im comfortable with alternative b as it is drafted now
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you all for your insights  my
recommendation also is to take no action and to maintain a bias toward further tightening  i have
heard very clearly the committees concerns about inflation risk and i recognize that we may have
to take further action in that direction later this year  i would counsel patience for the moment for
several reasons  first the level of the federal funds rate is probably not too far from where we need
to be  i didnt hear anyone suggesting that we were 75 or 100 basis points away from where we
need to be  second we have clearly conveyed the bias of our policy and i dont think there would
be a problem with our taking action  no one is going to accuse us of not having provided sufficient
warning  third theres the confluence of data that weve seen since the last meeting including
some improvement in the inflation data which gives us if nothing else a bit of breathing space to
observe what i believe remain some relatively significant uncertainties about the evolution of the
real economy  the housing market has looked a bit more solid and the worst outcomes have been
made less likely  but given that we have the breathing space to observe how that evolves i think
that waiting a bit more would be wise
the other point that id like to makeive made it before as have others but i think it is
quite importantis the endogeneity of financial conditions  the fiveyear and tenyear bond rates
are 35 to 40 basis points below the fed funds rate  that has several implications  the first is that we
dont want to completely ignore the information that may be in that  more important from a policy
point of view we could depending on the inflow of data see an increase of 30 40 or 50 basis
points in longterm ratesmortgage rates in particularwithout any overt action on our part but
simply by maintaining our stance and our language  we are very well positioned in that respect in
terms of the way markets are likely to respond to data that confirm our sense but not the markets
current sense
with respect to the language i listened with interest to the discussion  my proposal is to
take alternative b  but id like to discuss a bit some of the suggestions that have been made  on
section 2 i share the concern that some have mentioned about using the word rebounding  i think
that it implies that we are seeing the 35 percent continuing into the near term  i dont think that is
the central tendency of our forecast  alternative b section 2 does i believe clearly signal that we
have seen a change from december when we noted that there was substantial cooling of the
housing market and that recent indicators have been mixed  there is clearly a movement toward
a stronger assessment of the real economy
skipping to the risk assessment for a moment i share peoples concerns about the accuracy
of the language  like many of you i am reluctant to change that assessment given that theres not
a sharp change in our policy view simply because this has become recognized by the market  i
think its reasonably well interpreted  as i suggested with respect to the inflation remains the
predominant concern language its not entirely clear how that would be interpreted  in any case
theres a risk that there would be a perception of a significant policy shift which is not intended
we do need to think hard about this language  i note that well be discussing in march a number of
issues  perhaps we could ask for a bit of discussion about how going forward we assess the risks
and what kind of language we use in describing the policy direction  i think that would be useful
and if we are going to do it my recommendation would be to wait another meeting or two until we
either see a significant change in the outlook or agree among us to a more systematic way of stating
risk assessment
on section 3 regarding inflation ive been going back and forth listening to the discussion
we have dropped the word elevated  we could i think take the first sentence of alternative c
section 3  readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months but remain
elevated  the sense in which that is true is that the fourthquarter core pce was 21 which is
above some peoples target  so its not grossly inconsistent  at the same time the word
modestly conveys the sense that we are not completely on board with the idea that inflation has
made a substantial move downward or that the magnitude is enormous  i remain open if you have
additional comments about my recommendation to finding a way to incorporate the word
elevated  but at the moment i think it is somewhat more accurate to use the word modestly to
convey the sense that the improvement in inflation is still not that large  so having discussed these
issues and having noted that our bias remains clearly to the upside and that we must certainly leave
open the possibility of future tightening later this year my recommendation is to take no action and
to use alternative b as written  anyone like to comment  president poole
mr poole  i have one question here  do we intend in the minutes to make clear our
generalwell expectation is too strongbut tilt or bias in the direction of tightening later in the
year which i think matches what you just said
chairman bernanke  president poole i responded to something that you said in the
goround  i think the language of alternative b section 4 is not saying that were about to move at
the next meeting  it says essentially that the next move is more likely to be up but its very clear
that extent and timing could mean that it will be some meetings before we respond  i thought the
tenor of the meeting in the discussion of the economic situation was quite clear that our concerns
about inflation remain paramount and im sure that will be reflected in the minutes
mr poole  my question had to do with the coordination between the statement and the
minuteswhether were going to indicate clearly in the minutes the sense around the table about
that tightening  my sense was that we viewed tightening later in the year as more probable than we
did certainly in december  thats all im asking about
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  im not sure weve done this consciously but the way
the discussion in the minutes has evolved in the past several cycles is that weve made an effort not
to provide more nuance in the policy signal that is in that last paragraph  in fact weve adopted the
simplifying convention of pretty much repeating the part of the policy statement that is supposed to
signal a judgment about what policy is likely to be going forward  the minutes provideand this is
valuablea much more textured sense than the statement can about the central tendency of the
committees view of the future  i dont think it makes sense for us to try to agree now to provide in
the minutes more texture about whats in effect an elaboration of the risk assessment in section 4
it is hard to do while negotiating the minutes and theres not much virtue in trying to do it  all the
emphasis should go toward making sure that we characterize the sense of the committee about the
rationale for our decision which essentially concerns how our view of the outlook has changed and
what the variance of views is around that
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  first of all im fine with your proposal  i would have gone with the other
proposal but neither set of language binds us and that is the main thing that i agree with  that
brings me to president pooles point  i dont have a sense that we have a great increase coming later
in the year and i dont want to convey that such was the sense of the committee  now if he does
as an individual and would like that in the minutes thats one thing  but i would not want to have
the minutes read as something more than what i heard here today  trying to define a committee
sense of this that wasnt in the language here would make the minutes more confusing  so im okay
with this language and i associate myself with vice chairman geithner on the use of the minutes
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  there are differences of views about this around the table  a couple of
people have said that they think its likely that sometime this year we will think hard about raising
rates  i would trust that such views would be reflected in the minutes  is it your understanding
vice chairman geithner that our convention regarding the minutes is that we expunge from them
any comments within the committee conveying a sense of how we think policy is likely to evolve at
longer horizons
vice chairman geithner  i dont think its a problem regarding that penultimate
paragraph of the minutes in which the staff tries to capture the texture of what people say about
their thoughts on what policy is likely to do  but in the basic framing paragraph at the end which is
designed to capture whatever we as a committee are willing to say about whats likely weve tried
not to elaborate on or add nuance to the basic statement  so i guess im agreeing with you jeff  i
would have thought that the penultimate paragraph might describe whatever the range of views is
about that but not try to capture the consensus of the committee
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  the issue that president poole raised was whether the minutes would
likely be out of sync with the statement  what vice chairman geithner mentioned and i know to be
the case is that the last paragraph of the minutes is always the statement  so while the minutes
might have a nuanced discussion and possibly tilt a bit to peoples concern about resource
utilization or inflation however it gets stated and suggest some possibility of upward movement
rather than downward movement the paragraph that relates back to what we actually said in the
statement would tend to bring the discussion back and make the two harmonious as they should be
when people read the minutes they are likely to say theres a little more upside risk or a little less
downside risk  thats what i heard around the table  i dont think thats inconsistent with what you
suggested in terms of a statement
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you  president minehan said much of what i was going to say  the
minutes will indicate the tenor of the discussion which was that despite some good inflation news
we still see plenty of upside risk  that will convey the basic view here  id be very concerned
about being explicit about an interest rate increase down the line  we will be discussing this topic in
a few minutes i hope laughter about how explicit the committee should be in its forecasts about
the future path of interest rates  we havent made that decision yet so im a little nervous about
making it really explicit or even implicit in the minutes  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  i thought mr chairman that you described a convention a number of
meetings ago and i thought you expressed it very well  the statement that comes out of the
meeting is a consensus statement of the committee the minutes describe the range of views that are
expressed  thats consistent with the way weve been operating and i think it has served us well
chairman bernanke  i agree
mr moskow  may i ask one other question
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  i just was wondering since were focusing on alternative b how the staff
thinks the markets will react to the current version
mr reinhart  as we related in the bluebook and as a number of you said market
participants understand the risk assessment and they dont expect policy action or a change in the
risk assessment  so its hard to see that there would be any reaction at all  i wonder what our new
account manager would say as well
mr dudley  i would agree with that  you have somewhat firmer growth but better
inflation news and so the committee is about in the same place on net that it was before  i would
be very surprised to see much of a market reaction at all
chairman bernanke  thank you  ready to vote  ms danker
ms danker  ill read the directive from page 25 of the bluebook
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with
maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5 percent
the risk assessment  the committee judges that some inflation risks remain  the extent
and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the
evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming
information
chairman bernanke                 yes vice chairman geithner          yes governor bies                         yes

chairman bernanke  thank you  this would be a good time to have a fifteen
minute coffee break
coffee break
chairman bernanke  the second portion of our meeting is devoted to
communications  president plosser submitted a memo about external communication that
suggested there might be some unease in the committee  in the hope of somewhat reducing that
unease i thought i would try to state one more time what i was trying to get at when we discussed
this issue before  perhaps without taking too much time away from the important discussion we
want to have today if anyone would like to respond to that id be certainly happy to hear
i and a few other people had two concerns about talking in public about our communication
issues  the first was that we would try to avoid interfering with the ongoing discussion and the
development of consensus within the committee  the second was to try to avoid creating any
unnecessary political problems that might complicate the adoption of whatever we decide wed like
to do  so my recommendation would be to ask yourselves two questions  the first would be
would the remarks that i will give elicit opposition or significant disagreement from other
members of the committee  if the answer is yes then by giving those remarks you risk the
possibility that other people might be in some sense compelled to respond and then we are having
the debate in public  my sense of that is that therefore it would probably not be a great idea to give
a speech specifically on the pros and cons of inflation targeting for example even if you tried to
take a somewhat neutral position because its inevitably difficult to take a neutral position
however i want to be clear  i think that its perfectly okay for people to talk about broader
themesthe importance of low and stable inflation the importance of credibility the importance of
commitment and the importance of clear communication  i see no problem there because those are
broad general issues that i think everyone around the table would agree with and that dont
necessarily speak to the issues that were still discussing within the committee  the other question
id suggest you ask is would something that i say today be likely to end up being repeated to the
chairman in congressional testimony  laughter  that is a particular concern of mine  the lesson
i would take from it is that if you do talk about the importance of low and stable inflation which is
certainly a good thing to do you also make the point that we are of course committed to our dual
mandate and that one of the principal reasons that we seek price stability is to strengthen the real
economy
so those are my thoughts  i want to reiterate that this is guidance not regulation  i ask
people just to use their judgment and not to feel constrained about talking about broad issues
particularly issues that would command wide agreement in the committee and you certainly dont
have to disavow any previous positions  if you are pressed too far on an issue you can certainly
always say that the committee is currently discussing these issues and that well be saying more
about this in the future  again i certainly had no intention and have no intention of trying to censor
peoples words  i hope that you will continue to talk about the broad issues of price stability and
communication which are so critical to our function as a central bank  i dont want to take a great
deal of time from our broader discussion but if anyone would like to react certainly this would be
the time  president lacker
mr lacker  i think this is really clear common sense and very constructive
chairman bernanke  thank you  if there are no other comments ill turn the
meeting over to governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i thought i would begin by saying a few words on
process  ive had a number of questions from people about where we are in the process of
considering communication issues and how we see the next couple of meetings  i hope that today
we can come up with some sense of the central tendency or an expression of the committee on
where we want to go with the projection and the forecast process  i dont expect complete
agreement on where we want to go  i dont expect every question to be answered  but i think we
can probably narrow down the range of things were looking at and get a sense of where the modal
committee member would like to go with this  i also recognize that the decisions we make on other
aspects of communication and monetary policyfor example the numerical specification of price
stabilitywould then come back and interact with how you might want to use the forecast
in march we will revisit the issue of the numerical specification of price stability which we
discussed in october  ive asked the staff to work on some material  basically ive asked them to
take the pieces of the memo from january 05 that talked about things such as range versus point
which index or modification of an index the transformation of an index price level versus inflation
targeting the horizon if any over which we ought to specify thissome of these morespecific
issues that we need to think about if were going to have a numerical specification for price stability
the sense coming out of the october meeting was that the vast majority of people on the committee
wanted to move in this direction although exactly what they wanted wasnt clear  so ive told the
staff to assume that the committee is moving in this direction and now the task is not to debate that
whole thing again but rather to get a little more specific  by getting more specific we can test our
own notions of how this would work out and just how much in favor we are  the march meeting
will go two days and well be discussing those things  the chairman has put on the table another
item for the march meeting which is the issue concerning the announcement and the balance of
risks  if we have time in march it would be great to get to it  if not shortly thereafter we need to
think about the directions in which we seem to be moving on both the projection side and the
numerical specification side and their interactions with the announcements the minutes and some
of these other modalities we have for communicating with the public
i would hope that after the march committee meeting the subcommitteepresident stern
president yellen and icould take stock of where we have gotten to how the issues have been
narrowed where the committee seems to be heading what the open issues are and if we dont get
to the announcement or the minutes in march how these things might interact  then we could
come back to the committee in june the next twoday meeting and ask for some more guidance
and just keep pushing this process to a conclusion  we need both some dry runs on whatever we
decide to do and a strategy for rolling that out to the public and the publics elected representatives
once we get closer to a decision then we can talk about how to proceed on those two issues  so
thats the general process that im envisioning for the next couple of meetings mr chairman  i will
turn the meeting back to you   actually im supposed to call on dave reifschneider to start the staff
briefings
mr reifschneider4  thank you governor kohn  brian doyle vincent reinhart and i will be speaking this morning on the material labeled staff presentation on producing and publishing economic forecasts  as the top panel of your first exhibit notes the federal reserve regularly provides the public with information on the outlook in the monetary policy report congressional testimony the fomc minutes and the statement  you presumably undertake this effort with an eye toward advancing the goals of economic performance public discourse your own internal discourse and efficient operations  a key issue in your deliberations today is whether changing your practices in this area would advance these goals further or achieve a better tradeoff  as shown in the bottom panel this morning brian vincent and i will address three questions related to this issue  i will start with the production and publication options that are open to the committee  brian will then discuss what we can learn from the international experience  finally vincent will consider the governance issues that would arise under alternative arrangements
many ways of changing your current practices are possible  exhibit 2 focuses on one fundamental choice that you confront in this regardnamely how to produce the forecast  as noted in the top panel you have three main options  first you could continue to produce independent forecasts with each of you solely responsible for your own forecast  second you could choose to produce a single centralized forecast working together as the whole committee or delegating responsibility to a subcommittee  finally you could adopt an intermediate position and produce

4  material used by mr reifschneider mr doyle and mr reinhart is appended to this transcript appendix 4
coordinated forecasts with your individual projections conditioned on common assumptions for factors such as oil prices and fiscal policy
as highlighted in the bottom panel your choice among these three options has important implications for among other things your communications with the public and the operational cost of forecastrelated activities  to see this consider one important communication task the telling of the central story of the outlook  as noted in the first row under the independent option distilling an informative message from multiple forecasts is difficult even if those forecasts provide a considerable amount of detail about the outlook  in fact it is an open question as to whether it would always be possible to craft a central narrative that would command the consent of a majority of the committee given the diversity of your views  moving to the right the distillation task under the coordinated approach might be simplified a bit because your individual forecasts would share some common elements
nevertheless telling the central story would remain difficult if after settling on say a common path for oil prices you still disagreed markedly about its economic implications  in contrast as the rightmost entry notes the telling of the central story would be relatively easy under the centralized option becauseabstracting from the difficulties of producing such a forecastthe single projection would provide a clear and coherent message
your production choice has important implications for another communication taskconveying the diversity of views on the committee about the outlook  as noted in the second row of the table the independent option naturally reveals this diversity through your individual forecasts  to a large degree the same is true under the coordinated option although conditioning on common assumptions would obscure some of the possible sources of diversity  finally the centralized option would not reveal the diversity of your thinking unless the published outlook summary included additional comments about alternative views
your production choice also has important implications for the operational costs of both producing and publishing the forecast  forecast production is a relatively lowcost task under the independent option because you incur no expense in coordinating your forecasting efforts  still you could find yourselves devoting more resources to forecasting if you chose to publish your individual projections  moving to the coordinated option here preparing the forecast would be more costly because you would need to spend time choosing a common set of assumptions but you could limit these costs if you settled on a standard process for this task  finally producing a centralized forecast would be very costly especially at first because of the wide range of economic issues on which you would need to reach consensus  given the practical difficulties of achieving such agreement with a group as large as the fomc making this option feasible might require delegating the preparation of the unified projection to a subcommittee
finally there are the operational costs of forecast publication  this task may be burdensome under the independent option especially if all of you wish to participate
actively in the preparation of the text as you now do with the minutes  in fact given the inherent difficulty of crafting an accurate and informative central message from multiple forecasts negotiating the language of an outlook summary as a group would likely be even more timeconsuming than preparing the minutes if the summary is to be anything more than a barebones listing of numbers  publishing the forecast under the coordinated option also may be burdensome for the same reasons  however choosing the centralized option could make forecast publication less costly partly because you would already have reached agreement on the economic factors influencing the outlook  you could reduce costs further if you delegated responsibility for both producing and summarizing the forecast to a subcommittee
the top panel of your next exhibit considers some of your many publication choices  if you choose to continue producing individual forecasts you could release more information about those projectionsfor example by publishing the forecasts themselves  such a step would reveal more about the diversity of your thinking although it might risk diverting attention from any consensus about the outlook
another option available under all three production choices would be to provide more forecast details either numerically or in qualitative form  such a step would facilitate telling a more informative story about the outlook although it would also create additional dimensions for disagreement  a third possibility would be to lengthen the forecast period  this step could reveal more fully how you expect any economic shocks and imbalances to play out and thus might enhance public understanding of the basis for your policy actions it could also provide more information about your policy objectives and expectations for the long run  a fourth possibility would be to publish information about the outlook more frequently than you now do  such a change might help to clarify how you see the forecast and monetary policy responding to incoming data but it would also increase operational costs proportionately  finally you have the option of publishing fan charts and confidence intervals for your projections  this information could help to emphasize the inherent uncertainty of the outlook and the conditionality of monetary policy  before you could take this step however you would have to settle some issues involving the empirical basis of this material
the bottom panel of the exhibit addresses two options that you have for setting the projected federal funds rate  the first option is to condition the outlook on what you see as appropriate monetary policy  if you produce independent forecasts each of you would continue to make this determination on your own but under the centralized approach and perhaps the coordinated one you would need to do this as a group  as noted in the first bullet point publishing details on what you see as the appropriate path of the fed funds rate could facilitate telling a more informative story about the role played by monetary policy in the outlook  describing your policy assumptions qualitatively might achieve this objective alternatively you could release say the central tendency of your specific fed funds rate projections  one possible drawback to publishing an appropriate policy path is that the public might misinterpret it as a promise especially at first for this reason you might wish to pair any published fed funds rate path with information on forecast uncertainty  releasing
information on the fed funds rate might also generate public criticism and political pressures
a second option for setting monetary policy is to condition the outlook on a flat fed funds rate or on the path consistent with market expectations  this approach might mitigate some of the misinterpretation and political problems associated with the release of an appropriate policy path  however conditioning the outlook on such a path would alter the nature of the forecast and so create communication challenges in particular your forecasts would no longer represent your best guess for the likely evolution of the economy to the extent that a flat fed funds rate or a marketbased path differs from what you individually or as a group think will be necessary  for this reason the forecast summary would require some statement about the desirability of the projected outcome to avoid misunderstanding  you might even find it necessary to provide guidance about how the policy path would have to change to bring about a more appropriate outcomea step that would likely generate its own controversies  i will now turn the floor over to brian
mr doyle  as dave has explained policy committees at central banks may choose to produce and publish one of several different types of forecasts centralized coordinated or independentor they may choose to release a staff forecast  in the table at the top of exhibit 4 columns a b and c show some of the forecast publication choices of the central banks discussed in the international finance division background paper  seven central banks publish a centralized forecast one a coordinated forecast and one a staff forecast  in my portion of the presentation i will first address some factors shown in the last four columns that appear to be associated with these choices
by our reckoning the first central bank shown the reserve bank of new zealand possesses the characteristics that would most likely lead to a centralized forecast without dissent laughter it has a small policy committee composed of only the governor which does tend to limit dissent hence its committee is located in the same place and its head bears sole responsibility for monetary policy  the other central banks that produce a centralized forecast without dissents shown in rows 2 to 5 of the table share many of these characteristics  in canada row 3 as in new zealand the central bank head has primary responsibility for monetary policy  in other cases such as australia and norway rows 4 and 5 external members who have no executive functions mainly participate at the monetary policy meeting leaving the remaining members a larger role in producing the forecast
the swedish riksbank and the bank of england have members who all play a more equal role in shaping monetary policy  these banks also publish a centralized forecast but they recognize members dissents from the central forecast in their published minutes  the bank of england has a larger committee than the first six banks shown  the entire committee is involved in the production of each forecast and with the larger committee size the process takes about four weeks including many meetings to decide on the details of the projection
all seven central banks that publish a centralized forecast also release a single narrative of the forecast to the public  however their choices vary about the features of the forecast such as the presentation of uncertainty and the treatment of policy rates  three of these central banksthe norges bank the riksbank and the bank of englandpublish fan charts that convey the policymakers collective view on the distribution of possible outcomes  others describe uncertainty around their central forecast through their discussion of risks or through alternative scenarios  as shown in column c some central banks choose to publish their own forecast for the appropriate path of interest rates rather than conditioning their forecast on a specified path such as a flat path for the policy rate or one based on market expectations
in contrast to the bank of england the two other central banks with relatively large committeesthe bank of japan and the european central bankdo not publish centralized forecasts  to reflect the diversity of its nine policy board members views the bank of japan publishes the range and the central tendency of their forecasts along with the median  these forecasts are coordinated because the board members base their forecasts on a path of interest rates consistent with market quotes  these forecast statistics are published with a description of the outlook which is drafted by the staff with board input and then voted on by the board  board members may register with attribution their dissent from the description of the forecast in the minutes of the policy meeting  the ecbs policy committeewhich includes twelve members from the national central banks who are located throughout the euro areadoes not publish any forecast of its own but releases its staff forecast instead  the staff forecast is not voted on by the governing council and its standing with respect to policy decisions is not clear
as outlined in the bullets in the bottom panel despite the different choices of these central banks their publication of economic forecasts is generally regarded as useful  the central banks say that publication has eased communication  many central banks have started publishing forecasts none of these has stopped and most have increased the extent of detail reported  most observers agree that published forecasts have improved communication and facilitated accountability  many have commented favorably on the quality of forecast publications  overall commentary on the publication of forecasts by both producers and consumers is quite positive
however we have found very little econometric work that specifically evaluates whether publishing forecasts has improved monetary policy communication or economic outcomes  the publication of forecasts has nearly always been part of a package  attempts to detect major positive or negative effects of adopting such packages have met with little success  limited evidence suggests that their adoption may have helped anchor inflation expectations but whether the publication of forecasts has made an independent contribution is unknown  a few event studies have found that the release of forecasts has some effect on interest rates and other financial variables  on balance existing econometric evidence does not provide a
firm basis for assessing the cost and benefits of publishing forecasts  vincent will now complete our presentation
mr reinhart  exhibit 5 presents a decision tree outlining the possible paths you might take in incorporating an economic forecast in the policymaking process  i am including this schematic because among other reasons it is just what you would expect from me  laughter  before we trace out some of those limbs i want to remind you why the economic forecast is on todays agenda  discussion of monetary policy both here and abroad has increasingly focused on the forwardlooking nature of setting policy  for the federal reserve the structure of the current process of releasing an economic projection was set almost thirty years ago by improvisation in response to congressional prodding  is it possible that the committee could arrive at a more coherent way of producing and releasing a forecast that would enable policymakers to describe better what they do
the possibilities for producing and releasing a forecast are laid out at the top of the exhibit  note that a couple of the nodes correspond to questions from the subcommittee to you in a memo i distributed on friday  in particular as flagged by the 1 in the decision tree and repeated in the list below does the committee want to produce a joint forecast or conduct a survey of individual forecasts  the answer to this question is both hardbecause it has considerable implications for your time and resources in the system more generallyand easy to predictat least based on conversations ive had with many of you and your staff  to make it even easier to answer let me paraphrase those conversations do you want to change the basic nature of the committee process by adding multiple rounds of meetings so as to enforce a more uniform view of the outlook than has ever existed before or do you want to modify the status quo  laughter  if you prefer to continue the practice of providing individual forecasts you might want to reexamine the extent of coordination in that process  that is item 2 at the top and bottom if the forecasts are done individually should they be based on common assumptions about some key conditioning factors  chief among those factors is the path of monetary policy  do you want to continue with each taking your own view of monetary policy settle on some joint assumption or use marketbased quotes
the individual entries in a numerical forecast have only limited usefulness in describing the economic outlook and the backdrop for setting policy  rather the narrative thread explaining the forecast is the most useful because it allows the reader to assess the credibility of the projection to position his or her own view when there is a difference of opinion and to gauge potential risks to the outlook  as posed in question 3 do you want to accompany a forecast with a minutesstyle narrative description  as with the minutesand noted in question 4this document could be circulated for comments from meeting participants and ultimately be approved by the committee through a notation vote  such a procedure however will extend the interval between the making of the forecast and its release raising the number of times that inconvenient data releases will render the projection moot  if you want a
more timely release drafting and releasing such a minutesstyle document could be delegated to either the chairman or the staff
the last four questions cover technical attributes of a forecast  in particular as noted in question 5 how frequently should forecasts be made  the current semiannual reporting cycle was set by the congress but it means that the published forecasts become stale  another inconvenience with the current setup is that an annual forecast made in june incorporates an implicit forecast of the second half
would you rather be explicit and forecast half years  more generally as in item 6 how many years should the forecast cover  seventh how many variables should be forecast and which should they be  nominal income for example remains on the survey by historical accidentfrom the days when the velocity of money was thought to be predictable and knowing your expectation about income growth would help in setting a monetary range  are there other variables that would be more helpful
finally should there be some attempt to convey numerically the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts  relaying such information would more accurately convey the balancing of risks that is an integral part in your deliberations and would remind your readers that it is a projection not a promise
by now we probably have your heads spinning with all the possible permutations of the many decisions that could be made  with this many moving parts the problem is complicated  but not all the issues to be resolved are hard  first you have the force of precedent which is a powerful attractor within the federal reserve system that is why i wouldnt worry for a minute about whether the forecast and its description should reflect the views of the committee or all meeting participants  the precedents of the outlook portion of the minutes and the semiannual survey of forecasts establish that any release should reflect everyones views  second for the sake of consistency some of the decisions about the format of the forecast will be driven by other decisions you may make later  for instance if in your deliberations about quantifying the price objective in march you indicate a preference for measuring inflation in terms of cpi or pce whether headline or core the variable sampled in your survey should be a good indicator of that goal
if you can answer the hard questions todayeight of which the subcommittee sent to youthen it would be possible to frame out a rough structure of a specific proposal  detail could be filled in by surveying you later on technical matters and sometime thereafter you could get a formal proposal for consideration as part of the general package of work on communication  that concludes our prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for the staff  president
fisher
mr fisher  may i ask one question of brian
chairman bernanke  yes
mr fisher  brian on your exhibit 4 you point out that theres no econometric evidence
that publishing forecaststhese improved methodologieshas actually had an effect from an
econometric standpoint  but you make the statement that observers agree that forecasts have
improved communications and accountability which is a more subjective statement  who are the
observers
mr doyle  they would be a combination of market participants academics and anyone
with an interest in what central banks do or say
mr fisher  how do we measure improved communications and accountability  it
seems to be very subjective
mr doyle  unfortunately it is
mr fisher  finally i am just not as familiar as the rest of the fomc is but do any of
these banks have a dual mandate stated like our dual mandate
mr doyle  certainly  other central banks have multiple objectives  some that are
specifically stated are the ones that the federal reserve has stated  maximum employment and
stable prices  im not sure but some are quite close in terms of keeping inflation low and watching
output as well
mr mishkin  may i help answer this
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  the norges bank is actually the clearest on something close to a dual
objective  in their inflation report they have several statements of their objectives and they
explicitly say that they have a flexible inflation target regime  thats the first statement  what that
means is that they actually are going to try to minimize both inflation fluctuations and output
employment fluctuations  most central banks dont have anything as explicit as that when they do
talk in terms of hierarchical mandates in some cases a country does talk about output fluctuations in
an inflationtargeting regime and is more explicit  i think the riksbank is going to be moving in
that direction it was part of our recommendations to them
mr fisher  but currently its the norges bank
mr mishkin  currently the norges bank is the clearest
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president fisher i think almost all central banks even the so
called formal inflation targeters have in their mandate that they are to support economic activity
insofar as it is consistent with price stability  president lacker
mr lacker  this isnt a question
chairman bernanke  im sorry  is this for a goround or do you have a question
mr lacker  i dont have any questions laughter
vice chairman geithner  just answers  laughter
chairman bernanke  then please start
mr lacker  i thought the documentation distributed by the staff did a good job of
identifying the purposes that publishing forecasts ought to serve  theyre consistent with what i
described in past meetings as guiding principlesnamely that communication is useful to the
extent that it helps the public form better expectations about future policy and inflation and that it
will help in that regard to the extent that it provides benchmarks against which people can assess
their future actions  for me the purposes of communicating a forecast are first to reduce
uncertainty in the publics mind about future macroeconomic outcomes second to enhance our
credibility and accountability third to improve the coherence and internal consistency of our
discussions  its useful to stack up different questions and approaches against these purposes and to
see how they do  in any caseand this is a theme to which i will returnin achieving these
objectives i think its really important that published forecasts be clear and understandable to the
public  now the cardinal rule of communication is to understand your audience  its one thing to
explain our forecast and procedure to larry meyer or goldman sachs economists its another to
explain it to president plossers 2 million business head the helena rotary club or wherever we
find ourselves from time to time
before addressing vinces questions i just want to note that i think the value of publishing a
forecast would be greatest if it were paired with an internal agreement about our longrun objective
for inflation  i think having a prior consensus on that would simplify the process of obtaining a
consensus on the outlook and about policy  my own preference is that we state that publicly  to
the extent that an inflation objective represents a commitment regarding future policy you can view
it as representing an implied forecast of the longrun average value of inflation and so publicizing
that would help reduce the publics uncertainty along a very important dimension
regarding vinces first question i believe a single committee forecast is most desirable
this relates to the accountability objective  we are jointly responsible for the outcomes of
monetary policy so i think we should strive for an outlook that we can fairly agree represents a
collective sense of the committee  the value of accountability is that it enhances credibility and
its the credibility of the committee rather than of individual members thats really important  i
recognize that crafting a consensus on a forecast among nineteen or even twelve members even as
collegial a group as this is could be a daunting task  one approach would be to allow the
expression of dissenting views  this runs the risk however of making a committee forecast
nothing more than a compilation of members forecasts and i think it needs to be more than that
the message that the release of a committee forecast should convey is that we came to a process
with diverse views we talked things over our views perhaps moved closer together and we
ultimately came to agreement on a single forecast that most of us saw as not too different from our
own  that meaning would be watered down if there were a lot of dissenting viewsif they were
too frequent or too numerous  so i think there should be sort of a high threshold of disagreement
before any of us insists on differences being separately articulated  i would envision a processi
think one of vinces options sketched thisin which the staff produces an initial forecast along the
lines of the greenbook they have a great forecasting record and members would send in their own
forecasts commentaries or disagreements  then there would be some iterative communication
process on the basis of which a new forecast would be developed for a committee vote
regarding the question of conditioning assumptions i strongly believe that what we publish
should reflect our best sense of what is actually going to happen  my preference accordingly
would be to condition forecasts on how we think we are actually going to set policy as events
unfold  conditioning on any other assumptiona markets policy path or an unchanged policy
means having to explain that our forecast may be counterfactual  it means that in order to figure
out our real forecast people have to figure out how our policy choices are going to differ from our
assumed policy and then guess how we think the differences in policy are going to affect the
forecast  it means that the extent to which our published forecast reduces the publics uncertainty
about future macroeconomic outcomes is going to be limited  it means that our accountability will
be limited because we will be saying up front that this forecast might not be our actual one  it also
means that we will be chewing up valuable staff and committee time constructing a forecast we
dont necessarily believe in  here i think its instructive to imagine explaining a counterfactual
forecast to president plossers 2 million business head or to the helena rotary club
i realize that some members of the committee may be uncomfortable articulating an
expected path for the federal funds rate but what we publish about the nature of future policy
settings is a separate question from whether we condition on a cohesive view about them  our
discussion of the forecast is going to be much more coherent if we reach a consensus on future
policy  telling the public that our forecast assumes appropriate policy obviously makes more sense
i think if we have stated what inflation rate that policy is designed to achieve  if instead we adopt
some counterfactual policy assumption then not stating an inflation objective makes a published
forecast even less informative since people would have to know how the forecast differs from our
desired outcomes before figuring out what to make of it
as for vinces other questions on questions 3 and 4 i think the accompanying narrative
should be handled pretty much the same way the minutes aredrafted by the staff and approved by
the committee  on questions 5 and 6 i see greater value in publishing forecasts at longer horizons
in the event that we adopt an explicit objective we would want the period to be long enough to
show the forecast path for inflation returning near to the objective  again if we condition it on
market assumptions the period needs to be long enough to determine whether the forecast appears
to be moving toward our objective at an acceptable pace  question 7 asks how many variables we
should forecast  i think the optimal number is four  laughter  in case you want to know which
ones id choose id say real gdp inflation the unemployment rate and the fed funds rate  on
question 8 yes we absolutely should convey the uncertainties surrounding the forecast  i think its
important for accountability that we articulate our sense of the range of likely future outcomes  this
points to the importance of not simply assuming a path for the fed funds rate but allowing policy to
vary across different draws of the shocks that are going to affect our future economic conditions
otherwise our published fan charts for economic variables are not going to correspond to the
probability distribution that we believe will actually govern future outcomes and again well have
to explain the difference to the public  also i think that agreeing on a fan chart around outcomes is
likely to be conducive to achieving a consensus within the committee on the outlook
in closing let me reiterate the importance that i place on clarity  our communication goals
of reducing the publics uncertainty about macroeconomic outcomes particularly inflation and
enhancing our accountability strongly imply that we should adopt only a procedure that we can
easily explain to the public that the public will find useful and that avoids the confusion of
complex and subtle counterfactual assumptions
chairman bernanke  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  you said one thing that surprised me jeff  you began
by saying that the objective should be to help reduce the publics uncertainty about future
macroeconomic outcomes generally  now i can see that we have some capacity to reduce the
publics uncertainty about what inflation is going to be over time but is it realistic for us to have as
an objective to reduce broader uncertainty in the public about macroeconomic outcomes  is that an
achievable or desirable objective for communications  we can maybe reduce our uncertainty about
what we think about what those outcomes are but even we dont know much about the dimensions
of the future
mr lacker  im not suggesting that we reduce the publics uncertainty to less than our
uncertainty about future outcomes  but the econometric evidence is that greenbook forecasts are
superior to the private sectors forecasts  so if the public knew them their uncertainty would be
lower  i think theres reason to suspect that more information more communication from us about
our outlook is likely to reduce the publics uncertainty
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  i didnt know i was going to go second but thats all right
mr lacker  you can ask a question if youd like  laughter
ms minehan  no ive got plenty of questions here  anyway i too appreciated the
range of staff material that went into the preparation for this discussion  an awful lot of alternatives
are on the table and i think its good that weve been asked to focus on eight questions to try to
clarify things  but from my view the most important question was not posed and vince lightly
passed over it  yes thirty years ago or so we fell into the process that we now use for both creating
forecasts and communicating them and yes you could assume that anything youve done for thirty
years probably could be improved  i think thats possible  but id like to have some sense of what
is wrong about what were doing before i seek major changes to improve it
the staff paper suggests that in deciding whether or how to change the way we
communicate our forecasts we ought to be looking at goals of better economic performance and
better public discourse and accountability presumably not just in the short run but also in the long
run  theres some marriage there with the potential for setting longterm explicit price stability
targets  a third goal would be better internal discourse and trying to do all of that in the context of
having somewhat efficient operations  i think these are laudable goals  i continue to have concerns
about whether explicit longterm targets for price stability are really helpfulwhether theyll help
or hinder our cause  but setting that aside i think we need to think about our forecasts not just as
forecasts but in light of the full range of communications in which the committee now engages
we have two monetary policy reports a year  we have the central tendency of member forecasts
around gdp inflation and unemployment  they dont get a lot of attention right now  maybe
thats good in some perspectives given the way we do them  maybe thats not so good  we have
eight meeting statements  we have eight sets of minutes and we have copious speeches and
testimony  so there is a lot of communication whether its in numerical form or qualitative form
about how we see the future  each set of minutes has implicit in it a qualitative discussion and some
quantitative information from the greenbook forecast and an indication of where the members of
the committee are in terms of how they see the future unwinding  we certainly of course express
that a lot in our speeches and testimony
in my almost thirteenyear tenure on the committee the transparency of policy deliberation
has increased enormously  theres a healthy public discourse about what weve done what weve
said about it and what the likely future course of monetary policy is  in the end i think
accountability really depends on actions not so much on words and i believe our actions and our
words have shown us to be accountable  so im questioning whether some of this moves us to be
more accountable  in fact if you look over the past twentyfive years at the range of our current
forecasts albeit they have potential problems and they receive little attention that range hasnt been
at all bad in predicting what has actually happened over the period for which the projections are
made particularly when you look at inflation and unemployment  so despite our lack of common
assumptions and with the wide variety of differences particularly over the years in how we view
the mechanics of the economy we have published a central tendency thats been fairly narrow and
reasonably accurate at least for the things over which we have the most controlin particular
inflation  will more communication of forecasts result in better economic performance  i think
thats hard to prove  the staff has said its hard to prove  maybe yes maybe no
turning to the objective of better internal discourse more communication has already
improved the internal discourse of the committee  i have some qualms about referring to our
nineteenperson editing sessions as an improvement but setting that aside we have moved over the
years from saying nothing to formulaic statements to moreflexible language combined with earlier
release of the minutes  so i think that has all improved our internal discourse  vice chairman
geithner circulated something that implied we might further improve by sharing among ourselves
more detail about our internal forecasts and the attendant uncertainties  i like that as an
improvement on the internal discourse part of it  i think it has some merits for further discussion as
long as the intent is strictly internal consumption and theres no intention to force us to a common
view  so i am a bit at odds with president lacker and youll see more of that
can we do more than were currently doing  thats the question here  of course its
always possible to improve  but i think there are downside risks and i dont think they were well
discussed or articulated or articulated in a way i would like in some of the material  first of all the
committee is intended to be just thata gathering of independent perspectives on policy  thats
why we have our own staffs  our economic frameworks have converged over time but there are
differences in focus and in emphasis  if in the end we produce a single view rather than a range
what does that say about the need for a committee particularly with nineteen members  if there is
a single consolidated forecast that is for efficiencys sake delegated to a small group does that not
over time tend to disenfranchise those who are not part of that group  second committee members
in my view should be chosen for their judgment not their forecasting ability  forecasts are useful
tools but theyre not the only things involved in policy  if they were we could rely solely on a
model to set policy and we know we cant do that  at some point the effort involved in creating
and refining forecasts over and over precludes the work necessary to form judgments about the
current and the future stance of policy  third attempts to convey to the public the underlying
elements of a forecast including the policy path run the real risk as the staff has pointed out of
committing the committee to a particular action  at the tails of the distribution of economic
scenariosthat is if things are particularly lopsided from either a growth or an inflation perspective
or if theres a bout of financial instabilitysome form of path commitment can be useful and we
have used that in the recent past  normally policy is more reactive to incoming data than proactive
and appropriately so in my view  the staff papers say precommitment is not a problem elsewhere
or can be explained away  but the process of conveying such explanations in the context of us
financial markets may take more time and be bumpier than anyone expects  again i ask myself
what greater good would be served by risking that market reaction  finally if we did decide to
move to morefrequent forecasts whether centralized or not would the result be cacophony
weve got statements and minutes eight times a year the usual plethora of speeches and testimony
if we added to that more monetary policy type reports with forecasts is there a chance that we could
have too much information out there too many things that are potentially giving rise to commentary
thats not necessarily helping understanding but rather confusing it
so i come back to my answer to the first question that vince should have asked i think  i
have serious misgivings about whether changing what we now do in the monetary policy reports
and the related forecasts might be beneficial enough to offset the downside risks  i think there is
however some value in talking about something along the lines that vice chairman geithner has
implicitly proposed
now let me just quickly answer the eight questions that vince did raise  first of all i think
a joint forecast should be avoided  a survey of individual member forecasts is my preference  i
would aggregate them and present a central tendency either using existing procedures or some
modification that seems useful  i would not require that committee members use common
assumptions either for the fed funds path or for other elements  in my experience ive taken some
comfort that different committee members with different assumptions and policy preferences most
often develop semiannual forecasts for the next year and a half or so that are not much different
from my own  i dont believe that we in boston have the best take on how the economy works or
how nearterm risks will play out but the fact that the way we see the nearterm outcome with
appropriate policy is in the mainstream of the way most others see it gives me some confidence
that were on the right track  as i noted before the range of our forecasts hasnt been a bad
predictor of key economic outcomes
the third question has to do with whether the forecast should be accompanied by a minutes
style description  the release of our forecast is now accompanied by the monetary policy report
which by definition is the chairmans view of things  as a result of necessity perhaps the forecasts
we develop get little attention in the report  if we were to release forecasts more often we would
need some verbal text like the monetary policy report  but perhaps we could take a first step by
just changing the way the monetary policy report is formulated right now to give a little bit more
attention to the forecasts that the committee is making  whether that means that the monetary
policy report is a committee report not the chairmans report is an obvious next question and i
dont have the answer to that  but maybe a small step to take would be to highlight more that the
report has forecasts in there
the fourth question was whether the committee should jointly agree on the minutesstyle
description  frankly im wondering when we would do all this stuff  weve got a meeting in
january and february that comes out with minutes and a forecast and a monetary policy report
weve got a meeting in march  weve got one in may  weve got june which is similar to
january a meeting in august one in september one in november and december for which were
writing minutesall of which as i noted before have implicit in them either qualitative or
quantitative senses of both the greenbook forecast and the committee members forecast  that
implies that april and october are the only months in which we could probably do this  i think
trying to createand someone referred to this earliera minuteslike description of a set of
forecasts without a meeting around that set of forecasts would be really hard  there may be some
way of rearranging our meeting dates to get the dates to work out better  however it seems as
though wed be working on a lot of stuff some of it simultaneously if we were to keep the same
range of things that we do now  so my answer to question 5 is that im not convinced that the two
times a year we do it right now isnt about the right frequency
on question 6 i understand the argument for a longerterm forecast period  i understand
that it reveals future policy preferences and tradeoffs but i dont think longterm forecasts provide a
whole lot else  a longterm forecast isnt going to be realized  its more a goal than anything else
its hard to make forecasts six months out that are right on the mark let alone several years out and
they could imply that we know more or control more than we actually do over a longer period of
time  so if we were going to extend the horizon i would extend it only a littleto go for example
from a year and a half to two or three years perhaps  i would stay with the number of variables we
currently forecastnominal and real gdp unemployment and some measure of inflation
finally i think that conveying that were not certain about our forecast is obviously
desirable  i know other central banks have used fan charts  theyve proven useful  i know theyve
been accepted  i dont know how well theyre understood  but i do find myself wondering in the
us context what the average person or the average congressman would actually take out of them
even over rather short periods of time the range of outcomes about which were certain even at the
70 percent level really is kind of wide  so my view is that a qualitative discussion of the sources of
risk is preferable to a quantitative one  over time anything can be well understood i suppose but i
have a feeling that the range of uncertainty without an academic understanding of what youre
trying to do is more confusing rather than less
so to pull it all together im intrigued by vice chairman geithners implicit proposal of
improving internal discussion with more detail about our own forecasts and what the constraining
factors are and where we see policy going  i would not try to pull them together into a consensus
view  if we had a consensus view we would have to tell people about it and id be a little
concerned about that in terms of commitment  i also think that we could work on how our current
forecasts are actually handled in the monetary policy report  i do not think a central forecast is
useful  it has problems in terms of what it says about the committee and the committee members
im not convinced that common forecast variables or a path of forecasts is useful  im not
convinced that you can actually handle a more frequent release of forecasts to the public and i think
an explicit numerical discussion of uncertainty is difficult  so thats where i am for what its
worth
chairman bernanke  thank you  a twohander from president moskow
mr moskow  i have just a factual question  on the existing monetary policy report
you described it as the chairmans view  i looked at the existing report  it has a table with the
forecast and then a few paragraphs describing that forecast
mr reinhart  its the boards
mr moskow  the board staffs
mr reinhart  no  ultimately the board discusses it in a meeting and its transmitted
on behalf of the board of governors to the congress to fulfill its legislative requirement  so the
board is directed in the law to provide it
mr lacker  not the committee
mr reinhart  no  the board is explaining committee policymaking but its the
boards responsibility
ms minehan  so you wouldnt characterize it as the chairmans
mr reinhart  no  the chairman may choose to talk about the forecast in his
testimony  so in some sense you really have two opportunities to talk about the committees
forecast
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  when the act was being rewritten after the humphreyhawkins report was
sunsetted we raised the question of whether it should be a committee report rather than a board
report  but the congressional staffs are very focused on making it a board report in part because
they feel thats where the accountability is in the appointments process
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i also want to begin by complimenting the staff
for a very thorough and thoughtful set of background materials  in recent years we have made
notable strides toward increasing transparency and that has served to enhance public accountability
and to improve the efficacy of policymaking  at this point further enhancements to our
communications are both possible and desirable and i think our economic projections may be an
area with lowhanging fruit  surveys suggest that market participants attach a very high priority to
improved information concerning the committees outlook for the economy and monetary policy
in fact 83 percent of the respondents to the macroeconomic advisers survey accorded higher
priority to this objective than to the adoption of a numerical inflation objective  so the provision of
moredetailed and moretimely information concerning the outlook would help market participants
form sensible expectations and possibly improve internal discourse  we have been publishing
forecasts for almost thirty years so were a pioneer in this area  but i think we have fallen behind
stateoftheart practice and i think it would be useful now to make incremental improvements to
the governance structure the content and the procedures of this program
so now let me address each of the questions that vince sent out in the memo  the first is
whether we should provide one forecast or many  my answer is many  we are too large and too
geographically dispersed to make a unified option practical  the bank of england has a committee
a little less than half of our size  they seem to be the largest to produce a unified forecast but the
process is reportedly timeconsuming and contentious and i fear that the attempt to arrive at a
single forecast could end up undermining our collegiality not to mention our effectiveness  more
important than the practical side is that a unified forecast is not desirable  i think we hold a diversity
of views and i believe that diversity should be respectfully represented in all aspects of our
communication  that diversity goes beyond conditioning assumptions like the price of oil  some
of us have divergent conceptions about the structure of the economy and the monetary policy
transmission mechanism  given the diversity of views its fair to say that in most meetings no
unified forecast or forecast story even exists and i dont see how participants who fundamentally
disagree could if we tried to produce a unified forecast speak in public about the economy without
revealing those differences  the differences on balance are a source of strength  they reduce the
odds that we will become trapped in group think mentality conforming for conformitys sake
and reduce the risk that we will miss important insights that could help us avoid errors  the
problem is that this divergence makes it challenging to articulate the type of unified committee
views that i think markets really crave
the first question goes on to ask whether individual forecasts should be released in a
disaggregated format or presented in an aggregated way  i prefer the aggregated approach that we
use now with a range and central tendency  most of the time well end up with the center of gravity
for the forecasts that can be described in a useful way even though there are divergent views  also
conveying how we interpret the body of forecasts will be more useful to the public than simply
releasing nineteen separate projection documents  in principle the drawback of a central tendency
is that the results may not be entirely coherent because different forecasters get excluded for
different variables  based on our past experience this seems to me more a theoretical possibility
than an actual problem but i was intrigued by the discussion in the rs divisions memo on how
it could be possible to identify an entire set of variables for an individual participant as an outlier
and exclude them  i think thats worth thinking more about  finally besides distributing a central
tendency and range providing a histogram showing the full frequency distribution of forecasts
could be useful
the second question asks whether we should base our forecasts on common assumptions
concerning the stance of policy and other factors or alternatively appropriate policy and opinions
about other factors  im certainly in the appropriate policy camp  i think the alternative is
problematic  several times in the past weve discussed the possibility of adopting a common
assumption of a constant interest rate but that approach could lead to forecasts that would not be
seen as desirable by committee members  for example since a constant interest rate may not be
the appropriate policy it could produce a forecast with inflation thats high and rising and i think
that would be confusing to the public and not convey our sense of what would happen  the
problem can be especially pronounced as the forecast period is lengthened  a second issue is as i
said that participants differ on the structure of the economy and any common policy assumption
may make sense in one model but not another  the same comment applies to all the conditions and
variableseven things like the value of the dollar and house prices are endogenous variables that
should be determined within the model being used  so imposing common assumptions with a
variety of models could lead to incoherent results
now the third and fourth questions concern whether a narrative description of the forecast
should be released and how it should be prepared  i think we should provide a minutesstyle
narrative description of the forecasts  experience suggests that there is commonly considerable
overlap among the fomc participants regarding the factors that are critical in assessing economic
trends  for example right now a majority of us are focusing on developments affecting housing
and motor vehicles as well as the implications of tight labor markets for inflation over time and
that was reflected in the chairmans summary yesterday  these factors are usually emphasized in
the portion of the minutes that describes participants assessment of economic conditions  the
minutes do a good job of describing the state of opinion and also briefly describe divergent views
concerning the economy and the narrative should also describe the divergent views
vincents background memo emphasizes the need for speed in releasing this information
because new data can make forecasts stale  in addition the chairmans monetary policy testimony
and the issuance of the monetary policy report typically occur before the release of the minutes
from the january and june meetings  so it may be desirable to devise a procedure that would allow
the forecasts and the forecast narrative to be released before the minutes themselves  we could
delegate the preparation and release of the narrative to the chairman  it seems to me that he has
over the past several meetings provided an excellent summary of our discussions as soon as they
concluded and thats the type of thing that i would expect in the narrative  my preference
however would be for the committee to agree on and approve the narrative  a committee vote on
the forecast narrative would avoid the possible disagreement that might arise after the release of the
narrative but before the approval of the minutes  one way to expedite the preparation of the
narrative is for all of us before the meeting to share our individual forecasts along with a brief
written story explaining them  i thought vice chairman geithners summary really is an excellent
template of the form that such a submission could take  most of the time we would find that there is
an emerging majority view and a few alternative views  we could allow time toward the conclusion
of an fomc meeting to discuss longerrun forecasts and this would provide the staff with some
additional information concerning the committees views  i would hope it would be feasible for the
staff then to prepare a minutesstyle summary of views rapidly after the meeting circulate it and
allow a very limited time and very few iterations for comments and revisions so that the narrative
could be approved and released before the full minutes were approved
now i just want to turn to the technical questions that vince posed  with regard to the
frequency of forecasts the shelf life of projections generally is long enough to support a quarterly
production frequency  however given that we want to provide forecasts for the monetary policy
reports in january and june its difficult to see how we could evenly distribute four forecasts over
the year  the problem is that we have only two meetings between january and june  it would be
possible to spread three forecasts evenly over the year in january june and october and eight
might also work well but i fear that there could be a staff insurrection  laughter  in any event on
the question of the forecast horizon im fine with maintaining our current practice but i would not
object to a small increase in the forecast period  all we really know about the more distant future is
what our ultimate goals are and i would prefer that we provide that information in a more direct
way  the next question is which variables should be included  id prefer to continue to include
forecasts for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and some measure of consumer inflation
depending on the interaction with what we may later decide about the inflation objective  i dont
think any of the other central banks forecast nominal gdp  i would drop that and i think
consideration should be given to providing information on the fed funds rate perhaps the fourth
quarter level for each year of the forecast or alternatively a qualitative statement about direction
the policy path is necessary for understanding and interpreting any forecast and it was at the top of
macroeconomic advisers list for what the private sector wants to see  large and widening error
bands around the central tendency would help stifle the potential for markets to interpret these
forecasts as commitments  moreover narrative comments on the forecasts could emphasize the
conditionality and data dependence of policy  we will obviously need to do at least one trial run in
producing forecasts before going public with the new system and i would propose that we include a
numerical forecast and a discussion of the fed funds rate path in that trial just to see how it works
of course all these variables will be forecast with considerable uncertainty and i think it
would be helpful to convey this fact clearly  one way to do it would be to put confidence bands
around the forecast numbers and they could be derived by looking at the track records of the
fomc the cbo the blue chip survey the survey of professional forecasters and so forth  one
could imagine adjusting them a bit based on committee discussionsfor example when
participants note that they see the risks as abnormally large or asymmetric  information on forecast
accuracy could be presented in a table attached to the fomc forecasts to justify our choice of
uncertainty bands  my staff has developed a mockup of a graphical approach to representing the
forecast and forecast uncertainty bands and i brought some copies of what that might look like for
you to take a look at  i thought i would just pass it around the table here5
so in summary im in favor of enhancing the forecast information that we release  the key
point for me is that we should provide information on the diversity of opinion in the committee
about the numbers and the stories and i think procedures like the one i described to produce a

5  material distributed by president yellen is appended to this transcript appendix 5
minutesstyle discussion of our stories would be effective and permit this information to be released
in a sufficiently timely manner
chairman bernanke  thank you
ms minehan  may i just ask one question
chairman bernanke  president minehan
ms minehan  thank you  that was really interesting janet  your recommendation
would be not to condition on a common policy path but have appropriate policy  so in the end
when we publish the forecasts would it be a range of federal funds rates
ms yellen  has this sheet come around to you
ms minehan  all right so its a range then
ms yellen  if you look at this sheetwe might do this for all the variablesthe bottom
right panel shows the federal funds rate  these are obviously madeup numbers  but we have the
history and people would just add their own forecast for q4 for the federal funds rate  wed report
a central tendency and we would develop error bands around it resulting in the type of display you
would see  so obviously it would be a range of opinions based on appropriate policies reported by
the individual members
ms minehan  so the background in there is the range of federal funds rates of
appropriate policies that people submitted with their reports
ms yellen  yes the dark band in the center would be the central tendency of our
reports and the thinner longer lines would be bands generated by numbers we use for forecast
uncertainty
ms minehan  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  im embarrassed about time planning here  these
comments have been extremely interesting but im worried about flights and things of that sort
everyone should feel free to give their full views  be mindful if you can of time and if we dont
have enough time well have to think about how we might reconvene or otherwise extend the
discussion  was there a comment
mr lacker  yes  i just wanted to ask about the 70 percent interval  does that reflect
everyones uncertainty
ms yellen  we would have to discuss how to produce that but it might be based on for
example our frbus forecast errors that we would apply to the central tendency range
vice chairman geithner  sorry mr chairman  may i just try this again  i
interpret you as saying that you infer a central tendency from this process you outlined
ms yellen  with respect to the story
vice chairman geithner  you discern a central tendency of the committee about
our view about gdp or unemployment
ms yellen  well were submitting numbers
vice chairman geithner  then you attach some other method for framing
uncertainty based on past forecast errorsfor example of frbus greenbook blue chip or
somebody else
ms yellen  yes exactly
mr kohn  or our own forecasts
ms yellen  or our own forecasts
vice chairman geithner  but no it cant be that either  thats a little different
isnt it
ms yellen  we dont forecast the federal funds rate but we do have data on our own
errors with respect to the other variables
vice chairman geithner  but youre not suggesting that we try to aggregate or ask
the staff to aggregate our own uncertainties that we convey with our own individual forecasts right
ms yellen  no i think that would not be a very useful procedure
chairman bernanke  theres research at the st louis bank that says that the
fomc forecasts are actually pretty good  was there another twohander  president poole
mr poole  i have a couple of fairly quick points to make  first in terms of the audience
were talking to you really have to talk to the congress first  we operate under the federal reserve
act and were reporting to the congress  thats a very important part of the audience  i would put
the markets second and then the general public  so whatever we do has to be coherent to all three
audiences
i started with a question and i think its exactly where cathy was coming from  do we
need to solve a problem  is there something that is really creating a problem with what we now do
my answer to that is no  do we have an opportunity to move forward  my answer to that is
maybe  i dont think were really solving a problem  my view is that we are not in deep water in
what we do now  take the fan chart as an example  if you do this six months earlier or six months
later the fans go in different places  let me use an analogy  if you look at the cbo budget
outlook the cbo tracks changes in the deficit forecast and partitions the change in the deficit
forecast into three pieces  one piece comes from changes in economic assumptions one piece is
changes in tax and spending legislation and the third piece is changes in what they call technical
estimateshow much revenue you get for a given tax law  i think thats a very convenient way of
explaining the evolution  there is an opportunity not so much focusing on the forecaststhe wide
range of uncertainty makes it problematic as to how much guidance youre really giving to the
marketbut to explain why the forecast has evolved the way it has  my guess is that most of our
individual forecasts although theyre not all the same sort of move together  if something happens
we all move although were not all moving to exactly the same degree  with the analysis of why
the forecast has moved we could provide some insight into how our thinking has evolved as a
consequence of new information  we dont do that much right now  it could be incorporated in the
monetary policy report  i think some of it is already in there but why the committees central
tendency has moved could be made much more explicit  we would probably be able to come to
pretty good agreement on that if we were to look at a draft because were all responding to the same
fundamental surprises in the information section
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  first of all i want to deal with the general question that cathy alluded to at
the outset  i am strongly supportive of moreeffective reporting of a forecast for several reasons
one is that it helps the market to understand our actions better and i think that has a high value  it
can be part of the process of anchoring inflation expectations which i think is a key to successful
monetary policy  very important also is that it indicates a degree of openness and allows public
discourse about our views that has political benefits in terms of showing that were accountable to
the political system  so i answered this question very much in the affirmative
one issue is what the research has said about this  president fisher is absolutely right
these issues are subjective  the research staff said that there is no strong evidence and the reason
is that its almost impossible to get and in terms of econometrics its very difficult  the literature
in the area of transparency is in fact somewhat unsatisfying because its very hard to quantify
anything  in terms of research strategy it frequently draws people to do case studies and i am one
of the criminals involved in that activity  the chairman has also been involved in doing some work
on case studies that we did together  part of the reason is that you can look at the details and deal
with this  if you get involved in evaluating monetary policy which i did for sweden recently you
get to talk to wide elements of the society  in the swedish case there was tremendous support for
this degree of openness and it was felt to be politically very valuable by some surprising groups
the labor unions were extremely supportive for example of this kind of openness and believe it or
not of inflation targetingwhich was somewhat of a surprise
so let me turn now to the issues that we have to discuss  i want to provide an analytic
framework in which to think about this at least for myself  i think about seven basic principles that
are key in terms of how we might go about providing more information about forecasts  so here are
the seven principles and ill discuss them each in turn  first we need to allow for the diversity of
views  second this process needs to be efficient  third it needs to be timely  fourth it needs to
be relatively frequent  fifth it needs to explain the forecastthat is we need to tell a story a good
narrative about it  sixth it needs to emphasize uncertainty  seventh we need to stress that the
forecast period is longer than the policy period  let me go into each of these one at a time and then
youll see that it leads to particular answers to the questions at least from my perspective
the first principle is the need to allow for the diversity of views  i strongly believe
particularly now that im involved in this process that the diversity of views is the strength of our
monetary policy process  in fact i take the view that people have very different jobs here  ive
been on both sides of the fencemaybe janet you have been more so because you are a president
i was just an executive vice president of a bank  but bank presidents bring different information to
bear than the governors and this difference helps us make better decisions  so i believe in this kind
of diversity  another very positive aspect of diversity is that we have a set of staffs  we have the
boards staff and then we have twelve other staffs that actually act as a check and balance on each
other  again that has value  finally i believe that committees can make better decisions than
individuals  alan blinder has a study on this topic that i thought was really quite interesting
the second issue is efficiency  any forecast process has to be workable in finite time and
thats really critical  i sometimes get nervous when dave starts twitching at me but you dont want
the forecast process to overwhelm the staffs  im very sympathetic  having been in research at a
federal reserve bank i have been on the other side of the fence and so i really understand their
pain
as for timeliness there are important advantages to getting out the forecast quickly  when i
said forecast i didnt mean just the forecast i include the narrative too because youll see that i
think the narrative is important  the key reason for timeliness is to give the forecast and the
narrative more impact  the quicker you come out with them the more impact they have  in
particular the environment for getting this information out is much more controlled than that for
speeches or even testimony and i think thats the value  so quicker is much better  timeliness also
makes the forecast and the narrative less likely to be stale  the longer the interval between the
policy meeting in which you make a decision and the release of the forecast and the narrative the
more likely they are to be obsolete  one danger is that data could come in and make the forecast
look silly  so theres an issue about our looking good  the faster we come out with a forecast the
better off we are
the fourth issue is frequency  the key here is that the forecast and the release need to be
done often enough so that markets get the information they think they need to understand whats
going on  fifth a narrative is important so that markets the congress and the public not only see
our forecasts but also understand them  to be understood the forecasts need a story behind them  i
strongly believe that we need to write up a good story and that a good narrative can help us obtain
public support for our policy actionswhich is again a critical factor
sixth its really important to make sure the public and the markets understand the high
degree of uncertainty that we face  forecasts are toughnot just longterm forecasts but also short
term forecasts  david is of course nodding his head on this  the key reason that emphasizing
uncertainty is important is that it can lessen public criticism when we misswhich we surely are
going to do at times  weve actually been very good relative to others but were going to make
mistakes  at least if people understand the degree of uncertainty that will help  when you make
clear the uncertainty you make it easier for people to understand why theres a diversity of views in
this committee  its not because the participants dont like each other and its not because we
frequently fundamentally disagree  it is because we have different uncertainty in views of the
economy and thats actually exactly what is indicated by the fact that forecasts are very uncertain
also information uncertainty is important information for the markets  we want to help the
markets figure out what were doing and whats going on and we dont care just about the first
moment but also the second moment and even sometimes the third moment
finally the issue of the horizoni think we need a long horizon  when you look at the
literature on optimal policymaking what comes out very clearly is that the horizon that you have to
think about in terms of the paths of the variables we care about is further out than the policy
horizon which i would say would be about two years  any sensible way of thinking about how we
think about policy will typically involve periods that are longer than the two years it takes to affect
output or inflation  we need to express the recognition of that because doing so will clarify that
when we have paths in our forecasts we can then talk about how they are consistent with our
ultimate objectives  to give you an example  if inflation is substantially above our comfort zone
getting inflation down in a twoyear period may be too costly  as a result we may have to talk
about a longer period to assure the public the congress and the markets that in fact were doing
something sensible  so we need to go to a longer period than we have now  we see this clearly in
the bluebooks optimal paths  i have some issues about their taking as long as they do to get to the
inflation objectiveten yearsand about how we build expectations but they do indicate that a
period longer than two years is absolutely necessary for thinking about policy
let me now use these principles to talk about the eight questions that were posed to us by
the subcommittee  first should the forecast be a joint forecast  i answer very strongly no  the
process for doing that would be way too cumbersome and inefficient  no matter how charming or
colorful it would be it would be a nightmare
mr fisher  always charming
mr mishkin  its hard enough for the bank of england to do it with a committee of nine
people  we have nineteen  furthermore at the bank of england theyre all living in the same
house and talking to each other all the time  we have people all over the country with very different
jobs and so its just infeasible to do it  i think dave would quit  laughter  it would eat up a huge
amount of staff resources and we might have some of our research directors quitting or going to the
research staffs at the reserve banks  it would be very hard to get a timely agreement on itand
again i think timeliness is important  it would also be hard to get the diversity of views clearly
expressed  so i end up where janet ends upi think that we need to keep something like the
current procedure in which all nineteen participants give their views  it is very important that there
be no attributions and that we amalgamate the views in some way  the procedure we have now
may not be perfectmaybe theres something betterbut it should be something similar
question 2  should we have common conditioning factors  here again i believe that the
diversity of views is a good thing and so again i agree with janet that each participant has his or her
own conditioning factors  the most important conditioning factor is clearly the path of the federal
funds rate but i have mixed feelings about it  we may want to provide some information about
what individual participants think about this  the concern i have here is that the details really
matter  there is some danger if people seem to be making a commitment because we know that
any path one specifies is surely not going to be the path that actually transpires because new data are
going to come in  ive been very concerned about this issue and in fact i wrote a paper on it that is
cited in the rs document  sometimes transparency may go too far  in particular i was not a fan
of the moderate pace language that the federal reserve used in the pasti was not here at the
time but i think that language did not express the issue of conditionality enough  if the committee
then had to change the path which it surely might at some point it could be accused of flip
flopping which would create severe problems for the committee  however maybe we can do it
appropriately through fan charts to derive the degree of uncertainty but we really need to discuss
this possibility  the details matter  if we even think about going in this direction the trial runs are
going to be critical so i want to have a bit more of an open mind on that
on question 3 obviously for reasons that i outlined earlier i strongly support a narrative to
accompany the forecast  on question 4 i feel that the narrative and the forecast need to be very
timely  if we could do this it would be a great advantage to do it very quickly possibly even at the
beginning of the week after the fomc meeting  that would require a much more expedited
process  wed have to use some delegationto the chairman or the stafffor writing up this
process  that would require moving up the greenbook a bit  for us to produce our forecasts and a
narrative we need to see the greenbooki certainly needed to see the greenbook to come up with
my forecastbut then people could provide information very much along the lines that vice
chairman geithner provided  some might do it verbally  some might do it the way you did it
which was very nice  that could then go to the staff a little earlier than nowlets say by
wednesday  then a narrative could be written up that would go to people before the fomc
meeting and then could be discussed at the fomc meeting  i dont know how this would work  it
would require that we not go through as much of an iterative process as we sometimes dothat is
critical for the timeliness issue  one thing that we might think about is that we have the recent
developments part of the greenbook and releasing that might have some value  that would be
from the staff it would not be from the committee  it gives some flesh to the discussion that would
be in the summary so we might think about doing something with that as well
as to question 5 on frequency i dont think that twice a year is enough to give markets the
information they need  as for eight times a year again i worry about losing our top people from
the staffs they might come after us with pitchforks  i tend to lean to four but there is the interesting
issue about the timing of our meetings so wed have to work that out  so quarterly seems about
right to me  on question 6 because i believe the forecast period needs to be longer than the policy
period for the reasons i discussed earlier it clearly has to be longer than two years  however too
long a period might put too much of a burden on us  a period of three years which is common in
central banks would give the flavor of the direction of the path that were thinking about and would
be adequate
on question 7 to keep things from being too burdensome i want to use the kiss
principlethe fewer variables the better  at a minimum the three variables that i think are the
right ones are the ones that i think are obviousan inflation measure an output measure and an
employment measure  i think we should kill nominal gdp its a vestige of the past  there is an
issue about the federal funds rate but again that should be discussed  it hasnt been mentioned yet
but i would be uncomfortable providing projections of potential gdp  i think we do need it for our
own purposes but it raises really huge political economy problems because people can think of it as
a speed limit or a target for growth which could be dangerous  so although i welcome it in the
federal reserve bank of new yorks document that we received i do not think it would be
particularly wise to release it
on question 8 for the reasons i outlined earlier i think its extremely important for us to
provide information about uncertainty  fan charts are the right way to do this  i really like what i
see here but there might be technical details that wed have to decide on  should we give only one
70 percent confidence interval  should we give more shadings  theres an issue about how this
chart would be produced  the reality is that it would have to be produced in the same way that the
narrative is in the following sense  it would have to be delegated  the information from the
nineteen participants would help in producing it in terms of their views  the staff would have to
come up with some measures  then there would be some iteration along the same lines as the
narrative in order to produce it  but it then would have to be timely it would have to be released
with both the narrative and the forecasts themselves  so with that let me stop  i dont think ive
been quite as charming here  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  intervention president moskow
mr moskow  i have just a quick question about the narrative  would you see a
narrative significantly different from the narrative thats now in the monetary policy report other
than the fan charts or anything else that would be added  would you see the same type of thinga
few paragraphs describing the forecast
mr mishkin  this is why we need trial runs  the narrative needs to be a little more
detailed than that and actually a little more reflective of the different views  i think its a question of
writing a good story  one thing i have learned is that even as a scholar i learn particularly from
writing  in this case i think the committee will learn from doing these trial runs  then we might
say gee this is too short it doesnt give the flavor or it is too long and too involved or its too
difficult to come to a decision about it  so my answer here is lets do it and discuss it and then
well have a much better feel for it
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman we talked briefly about the norges bank and norway which
is a country of 46 million people a constitutional monarchy and my mothers homeland  my
mother taught me a wonderful phrase which i want to repeat here as an antecedent to this
discussion  its actually a quote from santayana  skepticism like chastity should not be
relinquished too readily  laughter  i admit to being quite skeptical about this exercise and i will
reveal my cards up front in terms of being sensitive to the arguments that president minehan and
president poole have made as to the predicate question which is is there a compelling reason to do
this  not only is the discussion charming but i am almost overwhelmed by the encyclopedic
knowledge of some of my colleagues  i dont possess that knowledge and i listen to it very very
carefully  but i have not yet heard a satisfactory answer  yes we have had an evolutionary process
over thirty years but is there a compelling reason to change the way we do our business
if you go back to davids exhibit 1 it says that we presumably would undertake this effort
with an eye toward advancing the goals of economic performance public discourse internal
discourse and efficient operations  i think of this in a broader context which is maintaining and
building or using president lackers word enhancing the publics faith and confidence in the
federal reserve and i think the faith and confidence in the federal reserve right now is pretty
high  now two words are being thrown around constantly in this discussion  one is the public
and the other is the markets  by the way im not going to get to the eight questionsi want you
to be relieved right up front  laughter  i cant get there yet because i havent answered the
predicate question  but i would ask the committee to consider what the public is and what the
markets are  governor kohn said something during our discussion of policy with regard to the
market operatorsi actually spent threequarters of my life being one of themthat i thought was
quite complimentary and summarized the current state  he said that nothing we have been saying is
getting in the way of the stabilizing properties of the market  i really like that  so my question is
what is wrong with the way were doing things if were not getting in the way of the stabilizing
properties of the market  i agree with cathys point that with regard to the market our actions
speak louder than our words  day to day there may be variance but in the long term thats what
counts  i believe that the markets may have had a difference of view they may have been testing
us but theyve come around and our actions have spoken much louder than our words
if the definition of public is the academic community i understand their insatiable
appetites in the pursuit of knowledge  i respect that but i think there may be other ways of assisting
that pursuit of knowledge than by increasing the frequency of our forecasts or the complexity of our
forecasts  i want to apologize to my friend from philadelphia in advance but are we talking about
those who operate the economythe women and men who run the businesses that create the
microeconomy and many micros make the macro whether they are 2 million businesses or big
businesses  i went back and counted  since i had the good fortune of coming on this committee i
have spoken on 236 occasions to managers of big and small operationsceos mostly some
cfos  not once have i been asked by them for morefrequent forecasts or for all the variables that
we consider or anything that projects the kind of complexity that weve been talking about today at
this table  im a former rotarian  i may be one of the few here  i speak to rotary clubs all the
time  the only question they want to know is where rates are going to go  laughter  i dont think
they care one whit about the complexity of our forecast models
but thats not the group im worried about in terms of the public  president poole raised an
excellent point which is that we do have to be mindful of the elected representatives of the people
who created our charter and who in the end we all serve and thats the politicians  i would just ask
you to consider the argument that were having against that background and the risks that it poses
this is a oneway street  we see this from the excellent work that the staff did  theres no going
back once you go down this path  vince mentioned our semiannual schedule set by the congress
need we do more  have they asked us to do more  should we do more before they ask us to do
more  shouldnt we think of this in terms of negotiating with the political class rather than giving
them something for which they may not even be asking  if we give it to them it may lead to still
more questions that we cannot satisfactorily answer  so i would beg the committee to consider
what were talking about when were talking about the public and the markets and whether this is a
compelling thing that needs to be done now
id like to emphasize a second thing  obviously being a bank president i do not wish to be
party to anything that emasculates the banks  indeed whatever we do and however we do it if we
do itand im not convinced that we shouldwe need to respect the banks not only for their
research capacity and the diversity of views and what governor mishkin and president yellen
correctly mentioned their geographic diversity but also as vital links to the public whether the
public is the elected leaders the rotarians the economic operators the financial markets or even
the academics
a third point and then ill stop is that i ask that we be practical in the way that we do this
president minehan mentioned that we do a lot  i have no doubt that we could do more but we have
constraints on our time  in being practical we also have to be wary of what other questions we raise
by providing more information  some elements may not be interested in our preserving our
independence or may be a threat to our independencei wont mention who those might be since i
dont want that on the record  mr chairman those are my three concerns and ill spare you my
answers to the eight questions which i hope ill have a chance to give at a later date
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you  ill frame my remarks around two propositions  the first is the
yes  we should be receptive to changes in our practices and procedures to the extent that they
make monetary policy more effective and provide clear public benefit  my general sense is that
providing more information about our views on the economic outlook can be a good thing when it
comes without impairing the effectiveness of the policy process  the second is the but  changes
that we make in this regard need to be done in a way that respects the diversity of viewpoints that is
central to the effectiveness and the effective functioning of this committee  i believe that the
strength of this committee and the source of its ability to conduct sound monetary policy and
facilitate confidence in our policy come in large part from the diverse backgrounds and views of the
individual members  although at each meeting we must arrive at a committee decision the
decision and the way it is communicated to the public are shaped by the views of all participants
in my experience mr chairman as policy evolves it is rarely the case that everyone
suddenly sees the wisdom of a major change to the direction of policy  rather one or more
members begin to articulate concerns with our current policy stance based on their experience and
their assumptions about unfolding events  as data begin to provide support for this viewpoint the
committee begins to move in a new direction  even when new positions are not subsequently
supported by the data our discussions benefit from considering alternative points of view and sets
of assumptions  consequently as we consider options that we might pursue to increase the
effectiveness of our communication i am strongly opposed to changes that would limit the
expression of alternative forecasts and viewpoints either in the discussion within the room or in our
communication with the public  i regard steps such as producing a joint forecast or requiring a
common interest rate assumption as extremely detrimental to the committees deliberation and
public communication  such steps would lead inevitably in my mind to the delegation of
decisionmaking to a small group of individuals and i dont think thats helpful
with that said let me focus for a moment on some specific issues on the role of forecasts in
policy communication and i would begin with some comments on the proper vehicle for
communicating forecast information to the public  if we decide to move forward with discussions
of our forecasts and providing more forecasts i would like to suggest an alternativeand like all
the other alternatives today it is superior laughterand it is based on how we would choose to do
this  if we want to convey this information in a way that is both timely and logistically manageable
we should use the minutes  this is an extension of what we now do  it takes us forward but i
think in a proper step
specifically i propose that we consider releasing a summary of numerical forecasts as part
of the minutes  we all prepare forecasts beforehand  as i remarked earlier it is important that the
information be in the form of a survey of individual forecasts not a joint forecast and each forecast
should be based on the individuals view of policy and not on a common interest rate path  the
minutes would contain summary information in the form of tables or charts on a small set of key
variables such as real gdp core inflation and unemployment  this information would be
presented in the form of a central tendency and the range of committee member views  i would not
include specific information about the policy assumptions used for the individual forecast
members would present their views in the meeting and then be permitted to revisit their forecast in
light of the committee discussion and decision  the forecast period would likely be four to eight
quarters as now with the semiannual report focusing on the longer horizon beyond that if we go
there  an advantage of using the minutes besides timeliness is that a narrative is already prepared
there would be less chance of confusion about the ownership of the forecast  the numerical
forecast information would supplement the qualitative discussion currently in the minutes and i
think it would enhance the publics understanding of policy  for example the recent disconnect
between our views and those of the financial markets might not have developed had the markets
seen our forecasts of temporarily slower growth and persistent inflationary pressures
a final issue is the use of common conditioning assumptions in the forecast  as i indicated
earlier i would not be in favor of requiring a common fed funds rate path  i think it might be
helpful for the boards staff to provide information on some of the conditioning assumptions they
use in the greenbook as a starting point for committee members forecasts  however as with the
fed funds rate path itself i would not be in favor of requiring a common set of assumptions for
individual forecasts  i think this helps inform the public but also keeps the diversity within the
committee and leaves the committee more effective  thank you sir
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i want to join the others in thanking the staff
for their very helpful memos  these issues are complicated and some of them are even hard as
has been said and i found all the memos helpful to me in framing my ideas on this subject
i find myself importantly in agreement with president yellen and governor mishkin
not in every respect but in some respects  so ill try to be a little more concise than i was going
to be  but i do think its important to confront the issues that presidents fisher poole and
minehan have raised  i agree that there is nothing fundamentally broken about what were doing
now  the markets do a good job and the public does a good job in anticipating what we do and
understanding how were going about our business and they even do a pretty good job in
anticipating where we want to go eventually  there is no compelling reason to change right
now but that doesnt mean were in the best possible place  i do think we could improve what
were doing  to the extent that we can improve the way we explain our policy particularly as a
committee it will help the markets anticipate  it will help on the accountability issues  i dont
think we need major surgery but there are some things we can do that might help around the
edges on these things  i also agree that markets are insatiable  whatever we give them theyll
want more and mostly what theyll want as president fisher pointed out is to know exactly
what were going to do with the federal funds rate three and six months from now and we cant
tell them that  so they will always want more
one thing that we can accomplish here is to shift attention a bit from the speeches of
individuals to the committees documents  i have told larry meyer and brian sack that my goal
is to be at the bottom of their league list on who influences interest rates  laughter  they dont
like that but im getting there  laughter  i dont want to influence interest rates when im
giving speeches  i think its much better if the committee speaks and if the chairman speaks
particularly when he is speaking on behalf of the committee in his speeches and his testimony
so drawing attention away from individual speeches to the committees views is a very positive
thing
understanding our actions involves understanding how much we dont know as well as
what we think we know  obviously we cant anticipate shocks  but as weve discussed around
this table we have very limited knowledge of the dynamics of the economy  we need to be very
careful not to give a sense of false precision about what we know  we also need to be careful
that we dont get invested in specific numerical projections and become less willing to change
our policies and our projections when new information comes in  partly for these reasons i agree
that the story we tell the narrative is as important as if not more important than the particular
numbers that we give out  its really the story that people use to inform their own forecasts of
the future to judge how events are unfolding relative to our expectations to understand which
aspects of the economic environment were really paying most attention to and therefore to help
predict  i also agree with the others that we need to recognize and respect the diversity of what is
effectively a nineteenperson committee we need to avoid doing anything that would discourage
alternative views and we need to think about how to represent alternatives views in our
communications
so against those principles here are my answers to the eight questions  not surprisingly
on the first question given the size of the committee the diversity and so forth i think that we
have to stick with making individual forecasts  i would publish them in some kind of aggregated
way as we do now  im kind of attracted to the histogramlet the public see the whole
distribution of the forecastbut thats a technicality  people worry about inconsistencies among
the central tendencies when youre choosing different people for each central tendency  but in
my experience of writing these things upwhen the chairman allowed us tolaughter those
inconsistencies werent a major problem most of the time  you could tell a coherent story
around the central tendencies  sometimes we had to use a little imagination but it wasnt really
incoherent  laughter  i think that chairman bernanke demonstrated this in his last two
testimoniesto take the central tendencies as we submit them and tell a pretty good story thats
helpful to the public
for many of the same reasons we ought to go with individual assumptions  when we use
individual assumptions such as appropriate policy rather than a common assumption were in
effect telling people the combinations of outcomes for inflation and output that we think are
possible if policy is run just right and that we would prefer  were giving a lot of information
about where we think the economy can end up and where wed like it to end up  in effect were
giving our read on where wed like to be on a taylor curve that links output and inflation
variability  a common set of assumptions as others have noted might not coincide with
appropriate policy for many participants  we wouldnt be telling people our sense of the best
possible outcomes  we could particularly if we used a market rate path tell them a little
something about where we expected interest rates to go because if the outcomes didnt line up
with where we thought things should be the markets might sense that and adjust  but there are
other ways of doing the same thing  so i think that individual assumptions rather than
coordinated assumptions are the way to go
should we collect and publish the views of the members about appropriate policy in
another histogram or central tendency as president yellen suggested  we may end up there but
i wouldnt start with that  i think it multiplies the odds for inconsistencies among the central
tendencies  youve got interest rates and output now that could also be inconsistent and could
create confusion  it risks shifting attention from the forecast to the rate path  i was somewhat
drawn to somebodys suggestion that if we had strong views we could indicate that qualitatively
in the narrative  but for now id stay away from the explicit interest rate forecast
because i think the story is important i think the narrative is important and a minutes
style narrative which discusses significant differences as well as the common tendencies is
important  such a process would be helped by our submitting notes with our forecasts that the
staff could aggregate and modify after listening to the meeting  i hope that submitting forecasts
and notes doesnt make it harder for people to change their minds at the meeting  im a little
worriedand governor mishkin mentioned thisabout shifting things forward to before the
meeting  it makes the information we get a little staler at the meeting  already were getting
something that was put together on wednesday for a tuesday meeting its already a week stale
im also concerned that if everybody has a forecast and circulates it having an exchange of
views in which people change their minds might be a little more difficult because you have
written down exactly what you want  so we need to be careful about that tendency but i still
think we could submit narratives and that would help
id favor morefrequent updates  i was thinking about quarterly but then theres
president yellens point about three times a year  the long interval is between july and
february  maybe we ought to start by updating between that sevenmonthorso interval and
then see whether we want to do it even more frequently  but i think we could update a little
more frequently than were doing  id keep my focus on just a few variablesoutput
unemployment and inflation  those are the key ones  id drop nominal income  were not
interested in velocity anymore  other variables like housing markets and energy prices could
be covered in the narrative  i would like to formally convey some measure of uncertainty  id be
tempted to use past forecast errors to do that  i dont think id like to try to finetune a fan chart
to begin with  if the committee had a sense that uncertainties were particularly large or
particularly small or were skewed to one side or another we could cover that in the narrative
then i have two thoughts on procedure  first we need to allow for some dry runs to see
how things work out wherever we end up  second as a former staff member i can tell you that
senior staff members are already stretched very thin around fomc meetings especially around
the semiannual report meetings  so if we ask them to do more we need to think about what else
were going to ask them not to do that theyre currently doing  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  first vice president barron
mr barron  thank you mr chairman  it may come as a surprise to some of my
colleagues given my expressed concerns over publication of numerical inflation targets that i
am very supportive of publication of forecasts by participants  the committee has for some time
now made routine references to the outlook in the statement without an explicit committee
forecast  explicit forecasts will in my opinion add to the already improved transparency and
accountability of the actions of the committee and will over time serve as a reference point for
expressing the important differing views among the committee members at this table and in
public speeches  as cumbersome and as painful as the process might be at least initially the
committee also needs to develop a consensus forecast that would embrace a central tendency
outlook  however this forecast should embrace not truncate outliers and use those as a signal
of dispersion of views around the forecast
as for the basis of the forecast it seems logical that some agreement on assumptions
would lead to fewer outliers in the forecasting process  while i can appreciate the benefits of the
common assumption approach i would suggest that the committee follow the appropriate
policy approach as it relates to the federal funds rate at least at the outset  that said one
alternative might be for the staff to suggest a set of common assumptions that would be used in
the development of alternative forecasts by the participants  however it would be understood
that each participants baseline forecast would be free from imposed assumptions
i believe it is imperative that any forecast be accompanied by a story to support the
outlook  this is consistent with my own recommendation as it relates to question 7 that we
should minimize the number of variables that we use in the forecast for the public  with just a
few key variables put forward we should be able to agree on a narrative for the forecast much as
we agree on a narrative for our current policy statement  i recognize that this will be
cumbersome and timeconsuming but numbers without the story would be analogous to asking a
doctor to treat a patient by seeing only the skeleton  the story could be developed in a minutes
style description but i would suggest that the forecast and description be an addendum to the
minutes  this would enable participants to share their forecast and opinions at the meeting  in
the discussion process participants would be given the opportunity to absorb the discussion of
the meeting and the various forecasts and then go back and visit with their staff to consider if any
changes are warranted in their own forecast and outlook
i hope that after the resolution of the startup problem that would no doubt be
encountered in this process the current publication schedule of the minutes for those meetings
where we do set forecasts would be restored  that said i hope also that the debate over the story
would be limited to substantive issues somewhat like a dissent on the current policy decision and
not a vehicle to capture every nuance in everyones forecast
i suggest that the forecast frequency be limited to two per year to start out but that we
would eventually move to a quarterly forecast much as has been said earlier  listening to my
staff talk about the planning period and the policy action requirement so far as time is concerned
i am struck that a threeyear planning period would be ideal from a forecast standpoint  the
process would be more effective at least at the outset with fewer rather than more variables and
i suggest that those variables be some inflation measure real gdp and unemployment  my
preference is to exclude a fed funds rate forecast because it could be interpreted as mentioned
earlier as a commitment  as for the uncertainty clearly our story must address uncertainty and
potential changes that might come in the future  i would choose not to use fan charts at least at
the outset as i could almost bet that a fan chart on unemployment would be on some
congressional committee members desk at an upcoming hearing illustrating the point that if we
miss our target millions of people will be unemployed  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also want to start by saying that the
memos that we received from the staff before this meeting were helpful and i think that vincent
provided the right set of questions to guide our discussions  the goals that were laid out in the
memo that dave distributed seem appropriate to me  from that memo and the comments from
david and brian this morning assessing whether releasing more forecastrelated information
will improve economic performance appears difficult  however i am persuaded that by making
some modest changes to our current practice of preparing and releasing forecastrelated
information we could readily and inexpensively facilitate a richer internal discussion and at the
margin better inform the public about our thinking  so i want to say at the outset that im
interested primarily in using the forecast to help us better understand each others thinking about
longerterm objectives policy risks tradeoffs and the workings of the economy along the lines
laid out in vice chairman geithners memo  from my assessment of our current practices and
the experience of foreign central banks laid out in karens memo i find no compelling case for
releasing additional forecastrelated information to the public with one exception related to the
forecast period that ill comment on later  so using vincents language im in the modify the
status quo camp and id like to answer vincents questions from that perspective
i support the independent option regarding forecasts  i think there is great value in the
diversity of opinions that individual committee members bring to both the internal and the
public discussion about monetary policy and i would like to use it as constructively as possible
right now i am not in favor of pursuing a single official forecast to be published by the
committee as an element in our policy communication process  although i am not opposed to
publishing information about individual forecast submissions i think it would be fine just to
pursue the central tendency approach that were using and the forecast range summaries that
appear in the monetary policy report today  regarding the conditioning assumptions i think it
would be counterproductive to impose a common definition of appropriate monetary policy or a
common set of conditioning variables  my hope would be that the assumptions and the
conditions that are important to each individuals outlook would be revealed as part of the
dialogue that we have among ourselves about our forecasts  i suggest that we incorporate a
summary of our views in the semiannual monetary policy report  for now it would be enough
for me to simply reflect the general sense of the conversation in the monetary policy report and
in our minutes in the same way that we regularly summarize our views about the outlook and the
policy situations today
i have no objection to delegating the release of a minutesstyle description of the
committees forecast discussion to the chairman subject to some consultation with meeting
participants in the drafting process  the process that were currently using to review the minutes
after each meeting could be used for drafting and publishing such a description  the narrative
then could be included in the release of the monetary policy report much as the central
tendency forecasts are included today  my suggestion is that our forecasts continue to be shared
in our semiannual format  i dont see the need for a morefrequent release of forecasts although
listening to some of the comments today i wouldnt be opposed to going to quarterly once we get
some experience with the process
one important change that i would make is that i would supplement our current
semiannual projections with a mediumterm forecast for the relevant variables  governor
mishkin mentioned three years  my personal preference is to go out to a fifth year so i would
continue to do the one and two years and then go out to the fifth year  my guess is that in most
cases providing something like a fiveyear period is long enough to assume that the fifth year
would obviously be made under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy and that would
generally align with individual members views of our longerterm policy objectives  even if a
fiveyear period is not long enough to reveal our longrun objectives perfectly the longer period
will help us to clarify the pace that the committee members view as appropriate in terms of
moving toward a more desirable inflation rate  it would also provide a description of any
tradeoffs that we perceive in meeting our objectives
i am comfortable with publishing a small set of essential outcome variables much as we
do today  at some point we might want to discuss further whether its still useful to include
nominal gdp as others have mentioned and what price index or indexes we should include
for now i am not proposing that the forecast discussions be extended to include any formal
measures of uncertainty
in summary my preference is to stay much closer to the status quo than many of the
other options that were presented by the staff  we have a lot to gain from shifting the focus of
our internal policy discussions to include a medium term and we can share that information
qualitatively with the public at a very low cost  these modest steps would not preclude us from
making moreambitious changes that the committee might wish further down the line  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  it is a little after 100  why dont
we take a break for lunch  if people could be flexible we can start somewhere around 130
maybe a few minutes before depending on how efficiently lunch is served  if anyone has
concerns about flights or anything like that could you please let me know during the break  mr
vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  do you have a sense a reasonable expectation of
when you think well try to stop  its very important but we could do this for days
chairman bernanke  it should be somewhere between 230 and 300 if we take a
half an hour for lunch now unless i hear concerns about flights and the like  its lunch time
thank you
recess
chairman bernanke  lets resume  thank you  let me start by saying that
weve had an enormous amount of discussion  if anyone is inclined to submit a memo to the
committee or to the subcommittee elaborating on your views or responding to some things that
youve heard please feel free  it will be very helpful to receive any information like that  lets
continue with our goround  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  in the interest of time id like to be able to say
that i agree with governor x or president y and just let it go at that but there are some nuances
that i feel compelled to cover so i will  let me just start out by saying that while i certainly
favor some changes to the production and publication of the forecast i do think we need to
proceed at least in some areas cautiously and conservatively  after all we are the central bank
laughter  beyond that once we make these changes we probably wont be able to retract
them so wed better make sure that we want to do them before we proceed
in that spirit let me address the questions  questions 1 and 2 fall into that category  i
think that we ought just to continue what were doing now in terms of conducting a survey of
individual forecasts and aggregating them  i have reservations about trying to come to common
assumptions for lots of reasons  practically it would be very difficult and im not sure at the
end of the day that there is a big payoff  so i favor the status quo so far as those first two
questions are concerned
question 3 pertains to the narrative description and there my answer is yesthe
forecasts should be accompanied by a narrative description  that step is very important and it
feeds into question 4  should the committee jointly agree on the minutesstyle description or
delegate the release  we have a number of options there  as some people suggested you could
tie this in with the minutes in one way or another  that runs the risk of the forecasts becoming
stale by the time the public sees it  im perhaps a little less concerned about that than some
others because the public will know when the meeting occurred  they know what information
we didnt have and they presumably know were not clairvoyant  laughter  let me put it this
way  i am not clairvoyant  some of you perhaps are but if so it escaped my notice  laughter
another way of handling this would be to submit the forecasts with brief narratives in advance
then of course wed have a pretty good jump on preparing the material at the end of the
meeting  so if were concerned about timing and about forecasts becoming stale we would have
the advantage of having materials before the discussion at the meeting  we can find ways to get
out the forecast and the commentary associated with it in a more timely way to the extent that we
think doing so is important  now here a dry run or two might be very helpful and i think it will
turn out to be essential to changes that we might make
question 5 is how frequently the forecast should be made  here again im not sure the
current schedule is too bad  adding a third forecast each year to fill in the hole in the fall and
maybe to address a bit the issue that bill poole articulated about providing more information
about how our views are evolvingthat might work out  but this is another place in which i
would be relatively cautious about being very ambitious right off the bat  similarly with how
many years the forecast should cover  i think there are arguments for extending it beyond the
current period but again i would want to do some dry runs and look very carefully at what we
gain before we committed ourselves to going out three years or five years or whatever the period
might be  as for the number of variables forecast i think we need an inflation variable a growth
variable and some sort of labor market variable and id let it go at that  putting out more things
would only add to the confusion  we could always decide at some future time to put out a
federal funds rate number a yearend number or something like that but i wouldnt start with
adding it right up front
finally should there be some attempt to convey formally the uncertainty surrounding the
forecast  there my answer is yes  whether we do it with fan charts or with some other
approach is something that we can work out but i think it is very important to do  i dont think
right now that market participants or the public more generally think that there is little
uncertainty associated with our forecast but its important to underscore the high degree of
uncertainty associated with policymaking  those are my views
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor bies
ms bies  thank you mr chairman  let me just make an introductory remark and
then im going to go through these questions fairly quickly  first ive heard different reasons
here for our looking at change  one issue is to improve the credibility of the fed  the point
about credibility that id like to make is that it is a trust issue  you earn trust by demonstrating
that you can achieve the objectives of your organization  i think we have credibility  whether or
not we put out a forecast our credibility is precious  if we dont demonstrate our ability to
control the inflationary pace were going to lose that credibility whether or not we have a
forecast  accountability too is important  we are a central bank in a democracy and whatever
we can do to enhance transparencyto let folks understand how we come about our policy
choicesis important  i use the word enhancepresident lacker or someone else used it
earlier but i like the wordbecause it says that things are going well  we always have ways in
which we can improve and we should be looking at change on the margin not major changes
i also agree with government mishkin and a few others that the strength of the way the
central bank is set up in this country is the diversity of viewpoints  we not only get different
regional inputs we also have people from different backgrounds sitting around this table
whether they are phd economists and experts in monetary policy experts in reserve bank
operations or folks from the private sector  we all come at monetary policy from a different
perspective  for that reason if we go forward in this vein i support individual forecasts and
retaining that diversity of viewpoints  therefore i dont support any common assumptions
each of us should be free to choose the framework in which we produce our forecasts  i worry
that forcing common assumptions sort of forces convergence and i would not be likely to
support that
i feel strongly that the most important part of issuing a forecast is the narrative  if we just
put numbers out i dont know what value added we have  the numbers in the greenbook dont
vary a whole lot in most of the scenarios but the narratives give a different flavor  as you read
through the scenarios you can say well i feel strongly this way but the model doesnt
produce a whole lot of difference  so i think its essential that we talk more about it in a
narrative form  that qualitative aspect really adds value to a forecast particularly with the
diversity of views that may occur from time to time  in terms of how we do the narrative the
proposal that vice chairman geithner circulated is a good framework that we could use to start
again if we do that before the meeting it may help the timeliness of the communication  it
should come out at the same time as the numbers whether its tied to the minutes or tied to the
monetary policy report  it is part of the overall process
as for technical aspects of the forecastagain based on the comments about staff work
i agree that we need to keep things simple  twice a year is sufficient at least initially partly
because we shouldnt overcommunicate the ability of monetary policy to finetune shortterm
variations in inflation and monetary policy  i think about my life as a corporate cfo and the
frustration of being held quarter to quarter to the results of a company when so much is going on
and you are managing the long term successfully  for that reason and because the lags in
monetary policy are so long i think were overcommittingwhether to the congress the
general public or the marketsabout our ability to implement and affect markets by doing too
short a forecast period or too frequent a forecast  however going forward i would lean toward
what we have now in the forecast and not go out longer  i understand that people want to go out
further because they think that doing so signals what our longrun real objectives are  but if we
want to set an objective lets just set the objective rather than having a longerterm forecast
because out in the long run were more prone to volatility and because timing too will be more
of an issue  i also would favor just the three variables that are related to our mandate from the
congressinflation real gdp and the unemployment ratevarieties of which are to be
determined but they should be tied to the mandate  down the road we could add more but for
now lets keep it to those three
i think its important to communicate uncertainty surrounding the forecast and i would
do that with regard to two dimensions  first whatever the consensus in the five years that ive
been here there have been periods when we did not know how far policy was going to have to
go  one instance was when we started down the path of raising interest rates we knew we were
going to go at a measured pace and we clearly signaled for a long period that this was where we
were going and that we felt confident that a 1 percent funds rate was too low  we were not sure
of the stopping point but we knew we had a long way to go  second regarding the central
tendency it is important to signal a rise in uncertainty around turning pointsthat our forecasts
about them depend a lot on incoming data  if in the committee we have an outlier or really
different viewpoints we need to spend a bit more time in a narrative explaining why we have a
difference of views
the only other comment i would make is that in thinking about the alternatives and the
variability around them it will be a challenge to communicate that effectively  so we should as
some suggested do a few dry runs  ive been spending a lot of time recently on basel ii pillar
iii disclosures regarding uncertainty and risk  looking at what we really can control through
monetary policy and differentiating that from other things going on the style that we choose in
talking about uncertainty and risk regarding the forecast will be very important  so i think it
would be good if we practice that communication a little first  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i will try to be brief  i was impressed with
president yellens excellent presentation and the thoughtfulness and scope of what she talked
about and i agree almost 100 percent with everything she said  but i want to mention a few
things that i think are important  theres an old forecasting adage if youve ever been in the
forecasting business  if you cant forecast well forecast often  laughter  now that suggests
to me that if this exercise were only about the forecast it might not be so important to do
frequently  but the purpose of publishing this information on a more regular basis is not so
much about the forecast as it is about communicating policy and the views of the committee to a
broader audience  our forecast is almost a byproduct but it provides in my view both the
foundation and the context for our current thinking about current policy and future policy
thats really the value of it to me  providing a forecast and a narrative would provide a richer
context  it would allow us to be perhaps a little more expansive about things in the narrative
ill come back to that in a second  we spend so much time around this table parsing words in
our statements each time and having a richer description of the context in which policy is being
made and the views that are being expressed would allow us to get away somewhat from our
focus on the language in the statement itself  it would provide us with some more flexibility and
we wouldnt have to worry quite as much about every word being parsed for some new meaning
the purposes go beyond just the forecast and its part in this communication  indeed a broader
principle is the transparency of the policymaking process  so let me go through the questions
and provide for each of them a quick answer and perhaps a little nuance
i certainly agree with most people around this table that we need to have individual
forecasts  i strongly believe in the independent approach  there is huge value to the diversity
sitting around this table  i dont think we want to put that at risk so im very supportive of that
in terms of common assumptions in particular on the conditioning variables i dont think there
ought to be common assumptions  we ought to use appropriate policy  i have a little
uncertainty in my own mind about whether that ought to be an explicit part of the forecast in
terms of what we publish  i am of two minds on that issue  on the one hand im sympathetic to
the notion that you want to be very careful about imprinting in the minds of the public that the
forecast is some kind of guarantee or commitment  i think thats not a big problem it can be
overcome with some discussion and fan charts and other things  on the other hand publishing it
has some value  i think about the times this fall when we were sitting around this table talking
about the weakness in the economy and housing and what we thought our outlook was  at the
time the markets were projecting that we were going to drop the fed funds rate to something like
4 by this spring but i didnt sense at the time that this group would have put as much
probability on that occurring as perhaps the market was  if we were in the business of generating
these forecasts that disconnect wouldnt have happened or it would have been much milder i
suspect  there would not have been as much uncertainty nor as much movement in those
interest rates had we been more forthright about what our thinking was going forward  so i think
there are some benefits to reporting out the range of what people think is appropriate policy
going forward but i acknowledge it also has some risk
the narrative is terribly important for making this work  indeed that is where you are
providing the richness  i think it ought to be a minutesstyle narrative  im a bit torn as to
whether or not individual committee participants should have the opportunity to write a side bar
if they are really uncomfortable with something  certainly if we allowed that it should be done
without attribution  but i believe that the issue here is more about timeliness and whether we
can do this in a timely way to make it work which is speaking to ricks concern  we just have
to struggle with that a little and figure out what might work best
how frequently should the forecast be made  i lean toward four times a year  i think
thats a good frequency and puts the forecast roughly at every other meeting  at first this will
be very difficult to do but if we get into a production cycle i think it is certainly feasible  as to
the issue of how many years the forecast should cover i think that it should go a little longer
than what we currently have  i lean toward three years  as we go out all we have to do is just
say something about what we believe the longterm trends are or in some cases perhaps what
our objectives may be  perhaps we want to get far enough out so that the longterm trend is
revealed
this gets back to what issues and what variables we report  i never have liked the phrase
potential gdp because i have never really understood what it meant or how to measure it  but
i do use the word trend a lot  im not sure its a bad idea when youre collecting the forecasts
from the members much as vice chairman geithner did to report what your view of trend is
we may or may not choose to publish that for some of the reasons that rick perhaps suggested
although im less concerned about his concerns i certainly understand them  but it would be
terribly useful to gather that information and to share itmaybe only internally so that we have
an idea of where people think the economy is in a longrun sense  the variables we ought to
publish would obviously be real gdp unemployment and a measure of inflation whichever one
we decide seems most appropriate  id be okay with a trend estimate although i dont feel
strongly one way or another  producing a fan chart or some information about the range of what
the committee thinks is appropriate policy would be informative  in particular i like janets
pictures because as you notice it has no line in it  there is no point forecast  as we convey
uncertainty about the forecast we want to do everything we can to steer people away from the
notion of a point forecast on anything because theyll latch onto that point forecast and
disabusing them of that will be very difficult  steering them away from a point forecast also
helps stress the importance of uncertainty in our forecast going forward and i think we need to
convey uncertainty  id even be inclined to report as these charts do just central tendencies and
not any medians or point estimates for any of the variables  i think thats a terrific idea
finally id like to make a suggestion  it will be very difficult to design the details
around this with the whole committee  i think governor kohn alluded to this consideration in
the beginning  so i would strongly support a motion that either the communications
subcommittee or a subcommittee that they delegate to would come back to this group rather
quickly with one or two wellthoughtout concrete proposals that we can discuss in detail and
begin thinking about how we might produce one or two dry runs to work out the kinks  i think
well make much more and faster progress in getting an outcome that we are comfortable with if
we have something concrete in terms of a proposal to talk about  thats all i have  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  in my views i associate most closely with
president stern  so i will avoid going through all eight questions and will provide perhaps three
further thoughts on what president stern talked aboutfirst on what our dominant goal is
second on what the benefits of going forward are and third on how we might go to market with
something along these lines
first with respect to the dominant goal i think as governor bies and many others have
talked about it is our credibility  our credibility today is somewhat asymmetric in the sense
that i think that we have a lot more credibility that we could lose in this exercise than we could
gain  not only is the credibility of this institution very high but i would say it is even higher
than it was six months ago  that suggests to me that we should go slowly conservatively and
prudently through this process  how does that relate to forecasts  when i think about the
forecasts that we considered yesterday for the fourth quarter which has passed id say that our
staff does a better job than anyone on wall street or than many of us could have done alone but
we see the errors involvedwhich is not at all a criticism but a reality of the business were in  i
hesitate to think about making forecasts four times a year including periods we were quite far
into and about how that affects our credibility  instead of extending into a third or fourth year i
would think about making forecasts in a goingforward rolling eight quarters way so that we
would always have a full two years in front of us  we wouldnt be in some ways culpable for
making an error of information that we really should know in the markets expectation  it does
strike me as a little odd that our forecast period changes by virtue of our current calendar  i think
about that from a credibility standpoint  i dont want to mess up in front of these markets so
obviously
id put the question of frequencies in the context of what benefits we are trying to
achieve  it seems to me that the predominant benefit is strengthening the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy between us and the capital markets and the reaction function of
the capital markets back to us  if we provided forecasts four times a year i fear that our numbers
might replace the markets own forecasts  that is they might say well im a little bit more
robust in my views than the fed  so im going to take their numbers and add a couple of tenths
because im the chief economist at morgan stanley or merrill lynch or goldman sachs  i
worry that our numbers might end up polluting the quality of the information they go out with
and then we would be reading back their numbers and saying boy our numbers look a lot like
theirs  arent we very good at this  i worry about that transmission mechanism effect  in
terms of the quantitative and qualitative information we put forward the focus really should be
on what don described as the story the narrativeone that wall street and the rest of our
constituencies like capitol hill can think about ask tough questions about and try to interpret
what we get back then in terms of their quantitative and qualitative assessment could be better
all of that speaks to the focus on the narrative rather than on the numbers
finally how would we go forward with whatever we conclude and what would be the
best means of ensuring that this incremental work that were doing has the beneficial effects that
we hope for  to achieve this goal efficientlyill use words that may be a bit more glib than i
intendwe should use a benevolent leader model  im not saying a benevolent dictator
model in which we all say hey chairman here are our best views they are all yours  nor is
the model a pure democracy where all nineteen of us parade these are my numbers  this is
my view of the world  these are my estimates  in which case we provide more information
but im not sure weve really helped the cause of what the fed is trying to achieve  the
benevolent leader model probably falls somewhere between the two  with that model we
would use the opportunity or the timing of the monetary policy testimony when everyones
attention is on the chairman and the fed for those macro forecasts  the chairman would report
the work product and the work product would have two pieces  the firstand i dont mean to
prioritize one over the otherwould be the chairmans work product which would incorporate
the views of others as he sees fit and he might well want to reference where his views coincide
with the central tendency and where they differ  but in that we ought not to constrain the
chairman  in that way i dont view the chairman in his testimony or in his announcement of
projections as the press spokesman for the fomc  those are his views  but second and very
much alongside his views he would present our views  his presentation of our views is useful in
making certain that a lot of attention is focused on them  in answer to one of the questions from
the subcommittee in some ways we might well be delegating to him the ability to draw a central
tendency and make appropriate conclusions  i trust in his ability to do this  if a future chairman
doesnt think independently and honestly provide accurate views of what the committee
members have said the committee has plenty of checks and balances at its disposal to make sure
that we have some discipline over that second half  so thats an appropriate way to think about
getting the most bang for the buck of this incremental work with which were proposing to go
forward  one of the memos said that the public is likely to place the most weight on a forecast
made by the entire committee  i think thats true only if the chairmans views happen to
coincide with the committees  if the chairmans views differ from the committees views
which i presume is not impossibleit is not obvious to me that the statement in the memo is
correct  if the chairmans views differed substantially there would be for better or for worse
different power centers and sources of information and i think the markets would be looking at
each  so thats perhaps another reason that i think this benevolent leader model might be the
best way to go forward  those are just some preliminary thoughts  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  as i thought about the alternatives before
us for making forecasts i had an even greater appreciation for the way weve done this to date  i
looked at the monetary policy report of course and other things that weve done and i think
weve been well served by the approach weve taken to datethe twiceayear forecast and the
central tendency descriptions  some of us were here when chairman greenspan told us that he
didnt really care for these forecasts very much  he said it was psychologically debilitating for
him to discuss them in his testimony laughter three weeks later because they became stale
well chairman bernanke has done an excellent job and i dont think he has been
psychologically debilitated so far that im aware of  laughter  but you have woven them into
your testimony and i think it has been very effective  so if there are important improvements
that can be made i certainly would favor them  but i dont have a good sense at the moment as
some others have expressed which communication issue were trying to address here  the
background memos were first class and i should compliment the staff  they did an excellent job
of describing how forecasts can play an important communication role for central banks that
have adopted inflation guidelines in one form or another  of course we havent adopted any yet
maybe we will  i think thats still an open question  but depending on the specific mandates of
the central bank the forecast procedures may depend on those details  in an ideal world id
prefer to know more about how were going to address the other communication issues first
specifically will we adopt a quantitative inflation guideline  will we specify a timeframe for
achieving that objective as well  how we answer those questions will give us a framework for
deciding what types of forecasts we want to provide  i guess that will be the discussion in
march
in the meantime we should go slowly in making changes in our current forecast process
our approach to improving transparency has been incremental  we have taken a step sometimes
a small step and then we assess that step before we take another step  over time we make a
series of steps that has significantly improved our transparency  this approach has served us
well because as gary said it would be very difficult to reverse a step that provides more
transparency  it would be viewed as a takeaway  in that context let me quickly go through the
questions then just for the record ill make some summary comments
so one i would say that we want to have individual forecasts  thats what the sense of
the committee seems to be  two they should not have common assumptions  i think its
important that they should be based on appropriate policy  they should be what we actually
think is going to happen  otherwise it would be very confusing  i think that a minutesstyle
narrative would be helpful  we actually do it already  its a board of governors document but
we do it  ill say a little bit more about that later  should we jointly agree on the narrative  i
think we should  we have to work out the timeframe but i think we should  how frequently  i
could see a case made for starting out doing one more a year in the fall  doing it would be
difficult for reasons that janet gave given our meeting schedule  but it could be done and i
think it could be done without a lot of work  ill get to that later as well  how many years  i
would like to go more years as you know rather than fewer  i like sandys approach going out
five years but i certainly think we should extend the timeframe  how many variables  i would
drop nominal gdp as others have said  then on the uncertainty question my initial instinct is
to communicate it in words rather than in fan charts but thats something we could learn more
about  im open to considering other ways if we find one that is simple and that people can
understand
let me make a few overall comments  first i thought that the document that tim
circulated before the meeting was useful  the major benefit to me in looking at it was to see
what assumptions youre making and i think that does help us in communication and in
understanding where people are coming from as they make statements at the meeting  its not
something i would want to see made public but i think it does help us in terms of
communicating with each other  second there was some discussion at one point about actually
putting out a forecast of the fed funds rate  id be very cautious about that  i know this is
probably at the top of the list of what privatesector people want but for obvious reasonsas
don said theyd like to know what it is going to be at our next meetingi would just be very
very careful about that  third i thought tom hoenig had an intriguing idea about putting this in
the minutes  from an efficiency standpoint doing so has a lot of advantages  in the minutes we
actually describe what we think the forecast is and we all review that description and make
changes and the process has been fairly efficient so far  i could see doing that without
producing another document so it would still be a committee document  of course the
narrative would still be the committee narrative but wed just do it as part of the process of
reviewing the minutes  i dont think you need any side bar disagreements in there because we do
that already  in some cases we say many members or some members  i think it is handled
quite well  so im intrigued by and attracted to that suggestion from an efficiency standpoint
and if we were going to do a third forecast say in october it doesnt have to be a separate
document at all  it could just be in the minutes  we could have a little table with the forecast
the central tendency and the range and then a description in the minutes
that brings me to the point that a number of people have made about a dry run which
obviously is crucial because well learn more about the process  this gets back to the point
about who does the description  is it the fomc  right now the fomc does the forecast and
the board of governors does the explanation of the forecast  if we put it in the minutes it would
be an fomc description and the narrative would be the fomcs narrative  in terms of timing
with the chairmans testimony this time the minutes come out just after you testify  so to fulfill
the accountability issue that the congress wants we could have it in the minutes as an fomc
narrative but the board of governors could then adopt it if the congress felt that was important
from an accountability standpoint  but it could be the same document  that way to do it seems
to me to be more efficient and it would be the committees view
that gets me to kevins point about whether we are constraining the chairman when he
is testifying or speaking about this forecast or about the economy  certainly we dont want to
constrain the chairman  his credibility is the committees credibility and the institutions
credibility and so its crucial that we not constrain him in that way  but if he felt strongly about
a difference between what the central tendency of the committee forecast was and his own view
i have great confidence that he could handle that without detracting from his credibility but still
enable us to have a committee narrative on the forecast  as i said i think a dry run would help
us understand this better but i do think we want to do this in as efficient a way as possible before
producing additional documents because it does require a lot of effort particularly from the staff
here but also from all of us who are involved and our research staffs
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  the question that presidents poole minehan
fisher and others askedwhy are we doing thisis always the important one  you always
have to think about the objective and what youre trying to achieve so that question has to be
taken very seriously  as part of our general obligation to improve the monetary policy making
process we are doing this as part of the broader evolution in improving transparency  we need
to be proactive  we dont have to wait for someone to ask us to give them this or that  we
should be controlling that process and we should always be thinking about ways to improve and
this discussion is very very useful in thinking about how to move forward  i want to repeat the
kudos to the staff for the excellent memos that they put forward giving us both substantive
information about what others do and ways to think about any sorts of changes
ill go quickly through the questions  i think its very valuable to have different points of
view that are reflected in the forecast  part of the value is that it is in the spirit of the federal
reserve act  a forecast that is seen as purely centralized would to some extent be contrary to
the act and could raise some hackles  it is valuable to get those differences of views out there
whether there should be common assumptions i guess i differ a bit from where
everybody else is  i think it would be worthwhile to make some effort when were going through
the dry runs to see if there are areas of commonality because it would provide more information
as president lacker said the clearer more centralized and more consistent the forecast the
more potentially informative it is and the more accountable we can be  so it might be
worthwhile at least to explore whether there are some aspects of commonality that wouldnt
cause inconsistencies of models or other problems  im not sure that we could get there but i
think it is worthwhile to spend some time on that  part of the motivation for doing so is that we
already put out a central tendency forecast a couple of times a year  although the market
respondents to that survey had said they want more of this when i talk to reporters or to market
participants they dont really seem to pay much attention to it or it seems to decay very very
quickly  they may pay attention for a very short time and thats why it might be worthwhile to
see whether something a bit more consistent could be given out about it  right now except for a
very small window around the two times a year that we put it out i dont see much emphasis on
it
its valuable to have a morerapid release of information  however the last thing i
would want is to feel that we have to get it out faster and to have that feeling impeding our
decisionmaking processeither needing to put out the greenbook earlier or constraining our
discussions because we had already put a line in the sand  i think its 42 and you think its 32
my memo is out there and my memo is better than your memo laughteri think that would be
a mistake  also particularly since we are thinking of frequency if we release information three
to four times a year it is going to get stale  but trying to get it out a week sooner so that its out
there for three months and a week or four months and a week rather than four months and two
weeks or three months and two weeks isnt that helpful  i dont want to undermine the excellent
decisionmaking process that we have  so speed is valuable but there is a cost to it and i dont
see the enormous benefit of getting it out a week or two sooner  as i said three to four times a
year seems reasonable
i like the evolutionary approach of providing some narrative because i think thats one of
the key things in providing more transparencyit gives us greater ability to convey to the world
how were thinking about things  it also helps us because we would not be as constrained with
the very few words that we put out as a committee  it would be nice in principle to be able to
use more words to convey our ideas rather than be so constrained  if we do put the information
out as a separate document i think that it will get much more attention  that may be valuable
but it also will get different reactions  right now it goes out as part of testimony that the
chairman gives  i could certainly see requests for morefrequent testimony if we start putting
the information out more frequently  we have to think about that kind of feedback dynamic
when we report more information what other demands might come  im not sure that would be
the case but i think the form and frequency with which we put it out may induce that kind of
response
with respect to the forecast horizon i think the key will be whether we are more explicit
on some sort of target or goal and then horizon should be related to that  i dont want it to go
too far out  at the council of economic advisers i chaired the socalled troika process in
which we would do the administration forecast  initially we had to do tenyear forecasts  what
information do we have today that will tell us anything about ten years down the line  we
would always revert to the mean and we would do that over a fiveyear period  basically we
didnt feel that we really had any more information after two to three years  so i would be
reluctant to push the horizon beyond two to three years unless we wanted to tell people about
what we sort of thought trend rate was  that could be valuable but only to tell people about
trend not to say that we really have any insight into whats going to happen four to five years
from now  generally our tendency will be to bring things back to trend  in terms of what to talk
about real gdp unemployment and some measure of core inflation make a lot of sense  id be
very reluctant certainly early on to talk about interest rates or interest rate assumptions
uncertainty is another thing  when we were working on the forecasts at the cea one of
the things that i and others had pushed for was trying to give some sense of the uncertainty when
we were making these forecasts  we actually got far enough to have some of our people talk
with people on capitol hill and we had very strong negative pushback  they were saying
well if youre not willing to stand by your numberwe have asked you to make a forecast
and youre not standing by it if youre giving us this range  also people will pick out the high
end or the low end of the range for their particular purposes and so you have to be very careful
about how you put that out  in principle i really want to provide the uncertainty i agree
completely with governor mishkin on that  but the form in which you provide it is very
important because we may think of it as uncertainty but others may think of it as either dodging
an obligation or making a particular commitment on the high side or the low sidethis is as high
as you can go and this is as low as you can goand see it as a bargaining type of thing  being
an academic i had never thought about it that way  but it is something that we should consider
in making sure that providing it is improving transparency and the effectiveness of monetary
policy  we dont want to get into side debates about exact numbersthat would be exactly the
opposite of what we want to convey about uncertainty  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i want to say just a few
things quickly about internal transparency about the analytical framework that we use to make
decisions about monetary policy and then about the external dimension of the forecast process
first on internal transparency i think that it makes sense for us to be a little more
explicit with each other about assumptions underpinning the forecast that we bring to the table
thats why i circulated the notejust to lay it out there in a clear way  without that
information it is very hard for us to know when we are debating what to do what we are really
debating  generally being more explicit with each other in privatediscreetlyabout the
conditioning assumptions that are important to our forecasts about what we mean by
appropriate policy about why and where we differ from the greenbook how we see the
balance of risks and maybe if we can at least a qualitative sense of uncertainty would be useful
and would enrich the conversation
on the analytical framework for monetary policy i just have two suggestions one im
going to repeat from our last conversation  the first is that i think we need to broaden the set of
analytical tools the staff gives us now at each meeting to think about the consequences of
alternative views in the forecast of different monetary policy choices and so forth  you give us a
range of things now that are very helpful  the two things we dont get now fall in the following
categories  one is that you dont give us a simple way to look at what it might mean for an
inflation forecast and an optimal policy exercise if you have a very different view about
structural inertia in inflationnot that theres any great way to do that now given the state of the
artbut it would be nice to have a way we could distinguish a little more clearly what a
backwardlooking highly inertial view about inflation fundamentals means for the way we think
about the forecast and monetary policy and what a more forwardlooking view of inflation
determination means  thats one area in which having something broader would be helpful
even if its a set of highly simplified highly imperfect analytical prisms reference frameworks
or reference models  the other thing that we dont get now is a way to think through how we
make more explicit choices about the appropriate period for example for bringing inflation
down to a more comfortable level  thats of course an important way to tease out what
peoples different loss functions or reaction functions are  right now we arent really presented
with for example a set of alternative horizons for bringing inflation back down to target and
what that would mean for the rest of the things that are important to us  those are two areas in
which it would be helpful to have a broader set of reference frameworks to underpin our
conversation of monetary policy  thats an important investment to make if were going to do
anything to change our current regimewhether in the direction of an explicit quantitative
objective for the definition of price stability over the long run even with no horizon and
certainly if were going to evolve in how we publicly describe our forecast
my second suggestion echoes a suggestion that randy kroszner made before  i think
that we would benefit from spending a bit more time as a committee on thinking through what
we understand about inflation both how it is captured in the model the staff uses and what are
the important distinctions between our views on these questions  we dont go very deeply into
those distinctionsjust a little  you can see this in both president plossers and president
lackers descriptions of their views of the forecast because they have a lower inflation forecast
than the staff has without a very different view about unemployment and with a modestly tighter
monetary policy  the case for that view deserves some reflection and we dont spend a lot of
time talking through that  thats an important investment to make if were going to be more
explicit in public about choices concerning for example how fast we want to bring inflation
down to our objective
two small things on that ground would be helpful when the staff comes back to prepare
for the discussion in march about inflation objectives  first a short treatment about the issue of
what makes the united states different would be interesting  we have a lot of international
experience to look at but were not norway and were not new zealand  i dont know how to
think through that interesting issue  im not sure its right but i dont think we can dismiss it out
of hand and id like some help thinking it through  another small thing to elaborate on a
discussion that janet don and i had on the margins  if you could tell us a bit about what the
past forecast error is of the mean fomc forecast and how that compares to the greenbook
forecast error that information would be interesting to have  its a small thing
chairman bernanke  there is research on that by the st louis bank
vice chairman geithner  good  and about forecast error
chairman bernanke  yes
vice chairman geithner  finally i have just a few quick points about the
external dimension of the discussion  im in favor of exploring a narrative that describes the
story of the committees central tendency about the outlook  its worth doing and the range of
issues on the table today in that direction i feel really quite comfortable with  im in favor of
doing it quarterly but i wouldnt want to make that decision without thinking through very
carefully whether it makes sense  i would want to explore different ways of expressing the
variance across the committee  i like the histogram approach  id even be open to the fan chart
device as janet described it for trying to capture different forms of uncertainty  i dont think we
should try to agree as a committee on a path for what appropriate policy means  therefore i
would not be in favor of working toward disclosing an agreedupon path for many of the reasons
that are familiar to all of us  i want to experiment with a minuteslike iterative process for
coming to some level of comfort with how that central tendency is described but id be willing
to give the chairman the role of final arbiter of what gets presented to save the staff from
endless negotiation
i think the horizon question is very interesting  i was inclined to think that three years
makes sense  a concern i have about three yearsapart from the one that janet raised which is
that it probably tells you only a little about your view of potential or your objective and it may
not have much information beyond thatis the following  if were thinking about the merits of
a regime in which we will not have a defined period that we commit to for bringing inflation
back to target we need to be comfortable with showing a forecast that maybe has inflation above
target for possibly a significant period of time  if the period is two years it will be easier not to
get ourselves in a position in which we feel compelled to show a more acute decline in that path
if were at three years it will be harder to avoid that  we will be uncomfortable i think if were
in a threeyear regime going for sustained periods with inflation staying outside that range
therefore i am a bit tentative about three years
whatever we do we should experiment first  we should be careful not do any damage to
a staff forecasting process that has worked very very well and serves the committee very very
well  also we should recognize the ignorance we all live with and should be careful not to start
down a road that would give the markets false comfort a false sense of precision false
confidence in our view of the world and all those other things many people have spoken about
let me say something about skepticism  skepticism is a very important virtue but its
virtue is not in the service of inertia  its virtue is in the service of trying to figure out how we
can improve what we do and how to save ourselves from mistakes along the way  so i dont
want to be outskepticked by anybody  laughter   i think its important to think about it that
way
as all this implies i dont think it makes sense to have uniform conditioning assumptions
imposed on our individual forecasts certainly not uniform conditioning assumptions on the
monetary policy path but also not on any of the important dimensions that are the focus
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  may i raise a very quick question  from time to time the politics of
budget deficits get all tangled up with differences between cbo and omb forecasts of the
economy  do we know whether fed forecasts have ever been dragged into that argument
chairman bernanke  not to my knowledge
mr poole  i think that the longer the forecast period and the more that it is a
committee forecast the more likely it is that the fomc may get pulled into that argument
whether were on this side or that side of the argument  i just raise the question because we
ought to be sure were clear about that before we make our own forecast period too specific and
too long
chairman bernanke  first let me thank both the staff and all members  people
clearly took this assignment very seriously and it has been extremely useful  i wont try to
summarize  laughter  fortunately we have a tape recorder  i would like to make a few brief
comments  i believe that we ought to increase our emphasis on the projections  ill talk a bit
about some of the parameters of that but i believe that i owe an answer to president fisher about
why  i dont think the process is broken  i dont think we have a serious problem  but i do
think we could do better  specifically to give some examples i think first that our statement is
too influential in the sense that we argued today about a couple of phrases a couple of words
knowing that the markets would seize on them and that they would move markets  if we had
moreinformative morecomplete descriptions of our views the statement would become less of
an issue  second i dont want governor kohn moving the markets  laughter  i think that
public comments are often overinterpreted  i know in my own case they have been  laughter
i recall the case in which a letter to a senator included the phrase wellcontained inflation
expectations rather than contained inflation expectations  that was a letter drafted by the
staff and i perhaps didnt read it carefully enough  it was the subject of commentary in the
markets for some weeks after that  we have a bit of space in which to improve our
communication with the markets and the public  this way to do it would be fundamentally
incremental  im not proposing and i dont think that anyone is proposing a radical change
we can build on something that has worked and that we understand how to do and of course we
would approach it very cautiously  but i do think that this is as president yellen called it low
hanging fruit in the sense that its something we could use to increase our communication and
transparency in a fairly low risk way  last spring there was a good bit of confusion in the
markets about how quickly we wanted to bring inflation down  the forecasts essentially
addressed that issue because they implicitly incorporate our policy preferences  so i think we
could improve our communication by increasing information about our outlook and our policy
preferences
another issue is a bit hard to explain but i will try  i think that our credibility is
enhanced if we can depersonalize it and make the ownership of our policy more the committees
and the institutions  its the credibility of the federal reserve that matters not ben bernankes
credibility  i assure you that we are better off with the federal reserves credibility  making the
credibility of policy part of a broader process with more input and clearer committee analysis
does to some extent increase the sense in which the institution rather than the chairman or any
other individual is responsible for the outcomes and the policies
having said all of that i dont advocate any radical changes  i think we ought to
consider three or four additional projections depending on the schedule and other factors
governor bies mentioned finetuning  perhaps the way i would look at it is that information that
we have about the outlook changes over time and six months is a long time  our views do
change within a period of three to four months and i think it would be informative to let people
know that  im open but i think we should have individual forecasts  the solution to the
problem of consistent assumptions is the one that president lacker mentionedto have people
make their unconditional forecast the same way a blue chip forecaster would do  that
essentially includes the forecast of what the committee is going to do which is not necessarily
the same for everyone but it is based on each persons view about where they think the economy
and policy are going  thats one approach  there are probably others but i want to suggest that
as a possible solution
many people have supported the narrative description  i think thats important  i think
being more timely would be useful  i dont quite follow the idea of putting the narrative in the
minutes  if we actually have this information say a week after the meeting why would we want
to wait until three weeks  it is more credible and more useful the sooner it comes out  the same
is true for the minutes  when the minutes were released after the following meeting it was a
nonevent  when they were brought out earlier they became viewed as a very informative
useful piece of information  so like governor kroszner i dont think we should deform our
decisionmaking process or be overhasty but if we can make such communication more timely
than the minutes we should probably try to do that
i agree with the many people who said that we should include some sense of uncertainty
there are ways to do that for example including historical numbers on the forecast errors of
previous projections of the greenbook of the blue chip or of somebody would give the public
some sense of what the historical record is and perhaps lead them not to overvalue the individual
forecasts  again i dont think this is particularly risky
as i said i hope well approach this incrementally  indeed the history of the federal
reserve since 1994 when we first began to announce the federal funds rate target has been one
of incremental change  this is a little unfair but president fisher you should go back and read
the discussion in the fomc before the decision to begin releasing the federal funds rate target
there was a lot of catastrophizing about what was going to happen and why what were doing
now is the best possible approach and so on  so i think this is really no more than a
continuation of twelve or thirteen years of progress in terms of information  the other reason
that this is not particularly risky if its done carefully and slowly is that we have a great deal of
international experience  obviously were not norway but weve seen what works across a
whole variety of central banks and financial markets have become more accustomed to this kind
of information being released
there are some important governance issues  whether we have an approval process or a
consultative process i think we could get a forecast together with some description within a
reasonable periodsomething on the order of a week or less after the meeting  let me make just
a suggestion along those lines  if we were to tie projections to twoday meetings and if we were
to have as we do now projections submitted before the meeting along with perhaps a paragraph
of description about the major elements of the forecast and the major risks i think the staff and i
could present on the second day a draft of what we took both from the first days discussion and
from the submissions of the projections  at that point we could get feedback or there would be
opportunities for people to change their forecasts or their views based on the discussions at the
meeting  wed have to allow for diversity and dissent and i think thats perfectly fine  weve
done that in many contexts and i think we should continue to do that  i would just conclude by
saying that many people have mentioned the importance of dry runs and a slow and careful
process and i think it would be very hard to disagree with that  weve done that in other cases
and i think we should do that here
so to summarize i think there is some basis for trying to increase our use of the
projections  it would be consistent with our previous incremental movements toward greater
transparency  it would provide more information and reduce the sensitivity of the markets to
other types of communication such as the statements and public comments  but we have heard
an awful lot of interesting viewpoints today and i dont envy the subcommittee which will have
to go through all of this and come up with a set of proposals  are there any further comments
president minehan
ms minehan  i know you dont want to prolong this meeting and i dont either but
im interested in what you think it feels like to all of us and to the market to have a twoday
meeting to have a minutesstyle summary of a range of forecasts come out and then a week and
a half to two weeks later have the minutes come out  how does that work  what is the
incremental information that comes from those two things since the minutes already have a
range of information in them that narratively anyway goes through a forecast and peoples
sense of where things are likely to go with regard to the forecast which i presume would be what
you would put into a narrative around the range of forecasts  it is certainly possible to do but
how does that work
chairman bernanke  i think its more informative to combine numerical
estimates with a qualitative description
ms minehan  then a week and a half later have another qualitative description
chairman bernanke  well thats not a reason not to do this  i think that you
could reproduce the information in the minutes there would be further amplification and
discussion in the minutes  i am just thinking out loud here  the description i have in mind
would be a page or two nothing substantial  the minutes would be an opportunity to provide
more information and show more of the diversity of views
vice chairman geithner  as president hoenigs suggestion president
moskows suggestion and your suggestion implied there is a range of variance around that and
thats one of the things well have to work through as well as how this fits within a set of existing
processes and disclosures that were going to preserve
chairman bernanke  theres also a question of how it relates to the statement
thats absolutely right  are there other comments  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i thank you and my mother thanks you for addressing the
skepticism issue  may i just add one other thing  you were very polite at the beginning of this
conversation but id like to reinforce what i interpret you as having said  the article from the
new york times a couple of days ago really bothered me  since were talking about proceeding
slowly and deliberately and several people have used the term dry runwhich is very very
important and i fully endorsei hope that no one forms or advances the discussion by having a
public revelation of what took place at this table  may i suggest since you constantly see certain
people who are not on this committee referred to that we be very careful in what we share with
those people because they are reference points  some of them are friends of many people at this
table but it appears to me that this does nothing but truncate the discussion or risks doing so and
has outsiders raising questions that we really dont want to answer right now  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  the next meeting will be a twoday meeting
march 20 and 21  oh david stockton
mr stockton  wed like to get updates to forecasts by friday
chairman bernanke  okayupdates of forecasts are to be sent in by friday
thank you very much  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
