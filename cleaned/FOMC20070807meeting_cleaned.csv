transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of august 7 2007
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  we start off today with some
welcomes and farewells  i would first like to welcome eric rosengren the new president of the
federal reserve bank of boston
mr rosengren  thank you
chairman bernanke  i have known eric for about twenty years  we used to be
squash partners  i wont say who won  we know who wins now  laughter  i admire eriche
has been a multitasker  he has been very successful as a researcher and as a bank supervisor
and he is no slouch with respect to monetary policy  so we look forward to your contributions
eric
mr rosengren  thank you
chairman bernanke  sadly today we have to say farewell to president michael
moskow of chicago  michael has sat at this table since 1994 which we have calculated is a total
of 104 fomc meetings  mike has been involved in public policy off and on since 1969 in many
capacities and he has seen both the good times and the bad times  we will have a luncheon
today after the meeting to honor mike but let us memorialize in the transcript that we thank him
for his many contributions and wish him the very best  applause
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  i will make some comments later on but i
just want to add that i counted 104 meetings too  laughter  it has been a privilege and an
honor to serve on this committee and i will miss the intellectual stimulation the camaraderie
and the spirit of doing what is best for the american people  thank you
chairman bernanke  today is also vincent reinharts final fomc meeting
vince went to work at the new york fed in 1983 and came to the board
participant  is he here
ms smith  hes coming
chairman bernanke  hes coming  well he gets docked for  laughter
mr kohn  make sure he submits a leave card  laughter
chairman bernanke  well let me make a couple of other announcements and
then well move on  first of all in the days when don winn was the head of the congressional
liaison office it was customary for him to present during the luncheon after the meeting an
update on congressional matters  laricke blanchard whom i think most of you know is now
the head of the congressional liaison office  we would like to begin that tradition again  we
have lunch of course for president moskow but if there are a few minutes after the
adjournment laricke will provide us with a short update  he has already circulated a written
summary  so if we dont get to the update at least we will have the summary  in the future we
are going to try to have a congressional update at every meeting
second on communications the subcommittee sent a memo to the committee on
july 25  broadly speaking the recommendations were that we should now focus on expanding
the fomc projections as our next step in increasing transparency that we submit trialrun
projections in september as we did for august and live projections so to speak for the october
meeting and that we vote in october to approve this step  my sense from june was that there
was a general agreement on this approach  we would like to give you several more
opportunities to comment and to discuss details  we will poll you between now and the
september meeting on remaining issues  in september there will be an agenda item for final
discussion of various issues that might come up  in october we will have another opportunity to
talk about it  i would like if possible to take a vote at the october meeting which would be
followed by a rollout about three weeks later with a press release and with a speech by me and
then by the information in the minutes that would come out  so that is where we are  again we
will have an opportunity to talk about the program on an agenda item in september
the subcommittee also recommended based on the discussion we had earlier that we
vote on the entire statement  i would like to make that also an agenda item in september  i have
asked scott alvarez our general counsel working with monetary affairs to provide us with a
memo that will address two issues  first what is the legal status  what specific action do we
have to take to allow the committee to vote on the full statement  second it would be
worthwhile to have them take one more look to see whether there are any unintended
consequences  for example would this inhibit us in any way if there were intermeeting moves
or any special steps being taken  but the plan would be to have a brief discussion in september
on this memo to take a vote and if we agree the full statement would be subject to a
committee vote  today lets stay with the old process which still allows a vote on the balance
ofrisk assessment
let me raise an item of business here  since vince reinhart clearly has disappeared we
need to vote for a replacement  we need to nominate and elect a new secretary and economist to
the fomc whose position would be valid until the first regularly scheduled meeting of 2008
would you like to make a nomination
mr kohn  i nominate brian madigan with pleasure
chairman bernanke  other nominations  laughter  if not all in favor say
aye  opposed  carried unanimously  congratulations brian
mr madigan  thank you very much
chairman bernanke  okay  i will wait until vince appears  he may be looking
at financial markets this morning and so we will wait until he appears to bid him farewell  lets
go ahead then to the authorization for desk operations and turn it over to bill dudley  bill
mr dudley1  thank you  as you all know there has been considerable financial market turbulence since the last meeting  problems in subprime mortgage credit have persisted and intensified creditrating agencies have begun to downgrade assetbacked securities and cdos collateralized debt obligations that reference subprime debt the problems in subprime have spread into the alta mortgage space and into parts of the prime mortgage market corporate credit has been infected with highyield bond and loan spreads moving out sharply and stock prices have faltered although markets generally have been functioning well in terms of liquidity and the ability to transact there have been some important exceptions  the nonconforming residential mortgage market and the structuredfinance product marketsespecially the cdo and clo collateralized loan obligation marketshave been significantly impaired and there are concerns about the ability of some assetbacked commercial paper programs to continue to source funding via that market  as a consequence market expectations with respect to monetary policy have shifted sharply with market expectations consistent with considerable monetary policy easing over the next year  market participants are worried about the effect of tightening credit standards on housing and about the deterioration in the market function in structured finance which could broaden and be selfreinforcing ultimately damaging the macroeconomy
i am going to be referring to this handout as we go through these comments  in tracing the source of the turmoil that we have experienced recently we find that the deterioration of the subprime mortgage sector continues to play an important role in several ways  first the deterioration in underlying credit quality continues unabated as shown in exhibit 1 delinquencies of more than sixty days for recent abx index vintages have continued to move higher and the pace of deteriorationmeasured by the steepness of the curveshas if anything worsened  note that the newest vintage072 so the second half of 2007does not show any benefit from improved underwriting standards  that stems mainly from the fact that the pipeline to build these securities is relatively longwith the average loan referenced by this index more than six months old at this point  it also may reflect the fact that this newest vintage getsin contrast to earlier vintagesless benefit from earlier home price appreciation  as a consequence of this poor credit performance abx spreads have continued to widen sharply  this is shown in exhibit 2 which shows the performance for abx bbb tranches across vintages and exhibit 3 which shows the performance for the various tranches of the 071 vintage  the deterioration in the

1  materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
higherrated tranches has been much more severe than earlier in the year  in part this greater deterioration reflects the fact that loss estimates have been trending higher putting the higherrated tranches more in harms way  it also reflects efforts to hedge subprime risk by going short these indexes by people who cant liquidate securities easily  translating these abx spreads back into price july was a very rough month for abx  price declines of 20 points or more occurred in the abx bbb tranches of some morerecent vintages  second the disturbing delinquency trajectories shown in exhibit 1 have caused the rating agencies to downgrade a significant number of residential assetbacked securities and cdos that have exposure to the subprime sector  however most of the downgrades apply to vintages before 062  for more recent vintages the loss experience is worse but still hard to estimate  this means that many more downgrades lie ahead  third some of the creditrating agencies have made changes to their structuredfinance rating models  that combined with huge markedtomarket losses even in highly rated subprime tranches has led to a fundamental reevaluation of what a credit rating means and how much comfort an investor should take from a high credit rating on an opaque structuredfinance cdo or clo product
the problems in subprime have spread into other mortgage markets including alta certain types of prime residential mortgage products and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs  countrywide for example announced a deterioration in its secondlien prime mortgage book  meanwhile american home mortgage which had operated primarily in the alta and nontraditional prime mortgage space as both a large monoline mortgage issuer and a reit investor was forced to shut down its operations last week and filed for bankruptcy yesterday
market liquidity for nonconforming residential mortgage products is poor and this has contributed to a further tightening in underwriting standards  for example a number of mortgage originators indicated that they will no longer offer 228 and 327 adjustablerate mortgage products and some have indicated that they will not buy any alta mortgages originated by brokers  at the same time that we have seen turmoil in the subprime market it has spread into the corporate sector as well  credit spreads in the corporate sector have also widened sharply  for example in july highyield corporate bond spreads widened about 150 basis points see exhibit 4  similarly the spreads on key hedging indexes that reference credit default swaps on corporates have also gone up sharply  for example in july the spreads on three of these major indexes rose nearly 200 basis points  this is illustrated in exhibit 5  the itraxx crossover index references fifty european nonfinancial names with ratings below bbb or at bbb and on negative watch  the highyield cdx index references  credit default swaps on 100 highyield us names  the lcdx index references credit default swaps on 100 us leveraged loans
in contrast to the residential mortgage sector corporate credit fundamentals still look good  in particular as shown in exhibit 6 corporate default rates for both investmentgrade and belowinvestmentgrade borrowers have been at very low levels  of course as we saw in the subprime market readily available credit can depress default ratios  one should expect that the tightening of credit standards in the
corporate sector would generate some rise in default rates independent of other developments  nevertheless other measures also underscore the positive fundamentals of the corporate sectorin contrast to the poor fundamentals in residential mortgages  for example global growth has been unusually strong with little volatility and corporate profit margins are unusually wide both in the united states and elsewhere  moreover the slowdown in profit growth expected for the united states has been milder than anticipated  this can be seen in the rise in the median equity analysts bottomup earnings forecasts for the sp 500 companies for 2007 which is shown in exhibit 7  it was falling through about april  since then expectations for this year have actually increased and they have been increasing recently even over the past month
so how does one explain the contagion to corporate credit from the subprime market given the disparity in fundamentals between these two sectors  although the answer is complex one factor stands out  there has been a loss of confidence among investors in their ability to assess the value of and risks associated with structured products which has led to a sharp drop in demand for such products  the loss of confidence stems from many sources including the opacity of such products the infrequency of trades which makes it more difficult to judge appropriate valuation the difficulty in forecasting losses and the correlation of losses in the underlying collateral the sensitivity of returns to the loss rate and the degree of correlation and the problem that the credit rating focuses mainly on one riskthat of loss from default
the clo and cdo markets have facilitated the transformation of lowrated paperfor which there is a limited investor appetiteinto a high proportion of high graderated debt  for example in a typical clo structure the underlying loan quality averages a rating of about b  yet through the magic of structured finance and the corporate rating agencies the resulting clo tranches are rated predominately investment grade  exhibit 8 shows the structure for a representative clo  more than twothirds is aaarated debt and 87 percent is investment grade  the loss of confidence among investors in the ability to assess the value and risks associated with this structured product has led to a sharp drop in cdo and clo issuance  as shown in exhibit 9 clo and cdo issuance plummeted in july  this is very important because the clo and cdo markets represent the bulk of the demand for non investmentgrade debt  with this demand falling away at a time when the forward supply of highyield corporate loans and debt exceeds 300 billion by some measures a huge mismatch between demand and supply has developed  the underlying problem is that the depth of the market for noninvestmentgrade rated loans and debtexcluding cdo and clo demandis far shallower than the market for investmentgrade products
where do we go from here   presumably buyers and sellers in the corporate sector are in the process of finding appropriate marketclearing prices  but it may take time for the market to settle down especially given the august doldrums that are upon us  moreover we still may have further scope for market dislocations  after
all some singlestrategy hedge funds that emphasize corporate credit may have been caught out by the sharp widening in spreads that has occurred over the past few weeks  when such results become known investor redemptions could follow leading to forced selling to generate the cash to fund these redemptions  in addition the assetbacked commercial paper market is very skittish in two areasstructured investment vehicles and extendable commercial paper programs  yesterday at least two commercial paper programs were subject to extension  it is not clear whether or to what degree these extensions will further unsettle the commercial paper market but that is clearly a risk
the effective shutdown of the cdo and clo markets has in turn raised questions about the sustainability of the strong bid by private equity firms to conduct leveraged buyouts  this uncertainty has undoubtedly been a factor behind the recent weakness of the us stock market  the importance of the buyout bid can be seen in the relative underperformance of the russell 2000 index compared with the sp 500 index during the past few weeks see exhibit 10  the problems in corporate credit and the virtual shutdown of the clo and cdo distribution mechanism have caused investors to reevaluate both the business opportunities and the risks associated with large investment and commercial banks  investment bank and commercial bank shares have underperformed the broader stock market indexes  in addition as shown in exhibit 11 the cds spreads for the major investment and commercial banks have widened considerably over the past month  the cds spreads for financial guarantors have widened as well even though the exposures of these firms appear to be concentrated in the most senior portions of the subprime and structuredfinance debt structures  perception of the strength of the financial guarantors could prove important given the key role that they play in some markets such as the municipal debt sector that lie far afield from either the subprime mortgage market or the corporate debt markets
only in the past few weeks have the problems in the subprime and corporate debt markets led to broader riskreduction activities  these riskreduction efforts are similar to the adjustments that we saw in late february and early march  a matrix that shows the correlation of returns across different asset classes over the past few weeks see exhibit 12 looks very similar to the correlation matrix that we saw following the late february riskreduction period see exhibit 13  it looks very different from the very calm period we had from late march through the first part of july which is shown in exhibit 14  but the adjustments are not uniform across markets  in some ways the risk reduction that we are seeing this time is a little more
us specific a little more corporate credit specific and a little more mortgage specific  for example as shown in exhibit 15 implied volatility in interest rate swapsthe smove indexand in equitiesthe vix indexhas climbed well above the late february peak  in contrast the foreign exchange markets have experienced a lesspronounced rise in volatility
in the united states the turmoil in financial markets has been accompanied by a shift in monetary policy expectations  exhibit 16 illustrates the eurodollar futures
strip  as can be seen the futures curve has shifted down about 40 basis points since the last fomc meeting  we are back where we were before the may fomc meeting  currently market prices imply a bit more than 50 basis points of easing by yearend 2008  the shift in expectations appears to reflect in part a revival of the downside risks to growth idea rather than that the federal reserve will absolutely cut interest rates  this can be seen in several ways  the shift in market expectations implicit in eurodollar futures yields has not been accompanied by a substantial change in dealer forecasts  as shown in exhibits 17 and 18 which show the federal funds rate projections of the primary dealers before the june and the current fomc meetings the average dealer forecast and the range of dealer forecasts have not changed much over the past six weeks  instead a gap has opened up between the average dealer forecasts represented in the exhibits by the green circles and the forecasts implicit in market yields represented by the horizontal black lines  the most recent dealer survey does not capture the minor forecast changes that occurred late last week  for example two dealers with tightening forecasts pushed back the timing of the first tightening and one dealer with an easing forecast moved it closer and increased the magnitude not shown in exhibits 17 or 18  the dealers forecasts are modal forecasts  in contrast the expectation embodied in market yields represents the mean of the distribution of expected outcomes  presumably it includes some possibility that the current market turbulence could lead to a weaker growth outcome and a reduction in the fomcs federal funds rate target  options on eurodollar futures contracts 300 days forward show a sharp downward skew in the distribution of rates see exhibit 19  although the mode is at 525 percent the same as it was before the june meeting the probability distribution has shifted down drastically below that 525 percent mode  so it may not be correct to say that market participants now expect much more monetary policy easing  instead a more proper characterization might be that the perceptions of downside risks have reemerged and this characterization is reflected in the downward skew below what is still a
525 percent modal forecast for the eurodollar rate

there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the june fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions
chairman bernanke  thank you for a very good report bill  are there
questions  president poole
mr poole  i have two questions  first does the new york fed have what i might
call material nonpublic information about firms that would suggest that there is more difficulty
than we see in the newspapers  that is one question  the other question has to do with the
distribution of views among dealers about probable fed policy  there is obviously an arbitrage
relationship between lets say a twoyear treasury and these futures markets  my sense is that
probably what is going on hereand i will use the twoyear as the exampleis a flight to safety
people are trying to shore up their liquid assets in case they have to sell some stock into the
market so they are trying to hold more of that  but there is no easy way for those on the other
side of that market to go short and push that yield back to where the bestinformed people think
it will be once we are past this turmoil  so what we may be seeing is less a reflection of
expectations about future policy actions than a flight to liquidity as a desperate effort
desperate may be too strongto shore up the liquidity of a balance sheet and there is no easy
way for people to go on the other side  those are the two questions i have
mr dudley  let me take the second question first  you know its certainly possible
that when people want to hedge their risk in areas where they cant easily sell the assets they
would buy something that will perform well if those assets continue to deteriorate  one thing to
do would be to buy eurodollar futures or treasury securities  so at least temporarily those
yields may not fully reflect what the market expectations are  that said the eurodollar market is
a very deep market and if one thought that the fed was not going to do what the market priced
in there certainly would be the ability of people to take the other side of the bet  so its sort of
hard to know exactly how big or longlasting the effects that you are talking about could actually
be  in the short run that kind of thing certainly goes on  if i cant sell the bad asset that i hold
then i will buy something that will perform well if the bad asset deteriorates  people actually do
talk about that on the trading side
as far as the issue of material nonpublic information that shows worse problems than are
in the newspapers im not sure exactly how to characterize that because i guess i wouldnt know
how to characterize how bad the newspapers think these problems are  laughter  weve done
quite a bit of work trying to identify some of the funding questions surrounding bear stearns
countrywide and some of the commercial paper programs  there is some strain but so far it
looks as though nothing is really imminent in those areas  now could that change quickly
absolutely  for example one question that were following with bear stearns is what their
clients do in terms of continuing to want to do business with them  obviously if people start to
pull back in their willingness to do business with bear stearns the franchise value of the
company goes down and that exacerbates the problem  one thing that we have heard about bear
stearns is that they have approached a number of major commercial banks about a secured line
of credit  we dont know what the outcome will be but they are clearly trying to get even better
liquidity backstops than those they have in place today  but as far as we know they have
enough liquidityand countrywide as well at this moment
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  lets go back to your previous comment on the second question of
president poole  another standard reaction is to sell things that are more liquid when you cant
unload things that are less liquid  one thing i am curious aboutand i dont know if we have
the data but this is the questionin terms of cdoclo issuance do we know how much is held
by nonus investors  for example i have been toldand i dont know if this is correctby a
senior partner at goldman that since 03 most of the mezzanine cdos were issued or sold to
asians or to europeans  im wondering if we are aware of any tripwires by which we might
have overseas the kind of reaction i just described which is selling assets that might be more
liquid to cover the illiquidity of something theyre stuck with  i would be interested to do a little
work if we can on cdo issuance and how much is held here  it seems to me to be common
sense that given that surplus liquidity has come from abroadand we have talked about the
surplus of saving a great deal and the chairman has talked about it a great dealthat may well
be where a lot of this risk resides and we should be aware of it  i would posit that probably the
same is true for assetbacked commercial paper  it is really the cdo market not assetbacked
commercial paper that i am most concerned about
ms johnson  president fisher i have a tiny bit of information in that regard  once a
year there are surveys taken of us liabilities to foreign holders and they are done security by
security  we went looking for the securities that had been downgradedby moodys i guess it
was or maybe it was both moodys and spin cdo packages to see if we could find them
we found a certain fraction of them in the survey which meant that the others that we didnt find
were not held abroad because the custodians didnt report them as foreign owned  of the
fraction of the securities that were actually found 40 percent were owned abroad which implied
about a 10 percent ownership of all the downgraded securities  not all of the securities but all of
the downgraded securities  a meaningful numberbut not a huge number not 50 percent not
more than half but a fractionwere in the survey of those 40 percent of the total outstanding
were what was held abroad  however not all countries are forthcoming with what they own
and it is certainly possible that the system doesnt capture all foreign ownership  china for
example is very unforthcoming  but our liability survey doesnt depend on their answering the
questions it depends on custodians answering the questions  so i would say its significant but
i think i come away from this information thinking that perhaps we are exaggerating a bit how
much of it is abroad
mr fisher  it might be interesting to look at the issuance dates of those if we were
able somehow to analyze the issuance dates
ms johnson  this survey which we basically have received just recently is dated
june 2006  so there is always a lag of several months to a year in the information that you can
get out of this survey  but the survey itself is very comprehensive
mr dudley  where the securities are held abroad is also very important  if they are
held in a hedge fund that is highly leveraged that is one thing  if they are held in a central bank
reserve account that is a small loss against all their other assets so it wouldnt have any
consequence  so if you talk to the dealers theyll say well we know whom we sold the things
to initially but we dont know what happens after that  i would expect though that most of the
stuff probably resides with the initial person because as we have seen these instruments are not
particularly liquid and so i dont think that they pass on that far  if you did a survey of the
dealers you might be able to make some headway in terms of figuring out whom they sold them
to originally  it might be a fair approximation of where they reside today
mr fisher  i have one other quick question and that is that i want to make sure i
understand what youre saying  it seems to me from this presentation that this is not just a matter
of price it is also a matter of structure and covenants  is that correct
mr dudley  i guess i would characterize the situation as people having lost faith in
the structuredfinance product especially the highgrade aaaaa product that they thought was
safe and therefore not subject to much market risk or liquidity risk  they found out otherwise
and so there is a total reevaluation of that market  as a consequence since the vehicle that was
used to turn noninvestmentgrade corporate debt and into investmentgrade debt is sort of
broken now they have to sell a lot of noninvestmentgrade debt directly and find people who
are willing to hold it  so i think about the situation as that demand has lessened at a time when
supply just by bad luck and timing is exploding  the market should clear because the
fundamentals in the corporate sector are good as opposed to bad but at a much higher price
mr fisher  thank you for an excellent presentation
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  the credit derivative swaps for countrywide and some of the other
mortgage providers spiked up very appreciably at the end of last week and they were accompanied
by announcements that the companies were having no trouble rolling over their financing  some of
the boston hedge fund managers have observed that one dependable correlation has been that the
announcement of no problem seems to be highly correlated with the actual problems occurring
with a lag of one to two weeks  laughter  i am curious whether you are worried about the
possibility that countrywide and some of the largest mortgage lenders might have difficulty in the
next two weeks rolling over financing which would obviously have a broader impact
mr dudley  they certainly could  their problem is that they have a very large
mortgage finance subsidiary and a small thrift  if the mortgage finance subsidiary were in the thrift
then there would be other ways of financing all their assets  so far they are able to maintain their
liquidity  but a lot of this is about perception and that could change at any time  the good news
about countrywide is that people view them as having a strong franchise  they also have a very
large loanservicing portfolio which might actually be worth a bit more because the duration of
those mortgages is extending  they are not just a mortgage originator whose business has
evaporated they also have other parts of their business which i think people view as potentially
quite valuable
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  an excellent presentation bill  one area that you talked a bit about was
the commercial paper market  that made me uneasy because this segment is different from the
other segments of the market that you were talking about and obviously that shortterm financing is
crucial to companies  i wonder if you could expand on your comments there
mr dudley  two areas of the assetbacked commercial paper market are being closely
scrutinized which means that a whole bunch of the assetbacked commercial paper market is fine
such as the assetbacked commercial paper with backstopsyou know credit card receivables
that area is fine it is not a problem  one difficult area is the extendable commercial paper
programs that are funding some of the stuff that is very illiquid right now  the risk is that investors
typically money market mutual funds will look at the situation and say gee if they cant roll over
commercial paper my commercial paper investment will automatically be extended to a longer
maturity  they are worried about the headline risk of that  they are also worriedand it is hard
to know how worriedthat there is no guarantee that the extended commercial paper would
necessarily trade at par  if it traded below par then they would have to worry about breaking the
buck which is the last thing they want to do  so the risk is that the investors who are quite risk
averse in the commercial paper market in this area will pull back and that very pulling back will
cause extension  that is what was happening yesterday  apparently a couple of commercial paper
programs were extended  now does extension mean anything really necessarily bad  it is not
clear  it hasnt happened before and so we really havent experienced how this extension process is
going to work  these programs are backstops in various forms  at the end of the day the
commercial paper holders should come out whole but until that is demonstrated you can imagine
that the extensions could cause other people to pull back  so there is a risk of a cascading of
extensions that has crossed all of these extendable commercial paper products  that is a risk  you
know it is an interesting tension right now because the large investors know that if they dont roll
theyll probably be extended  so at the current time most of them are continuing to roll so that they
dont get stuck with extended commercial paper  but this situation is very fragile day to day
the second area is more complexstructured investment finance vehicles that basically
fund pipelines of highly rated cdo and clo kind of stuff  i cant say i fully appreciate exactly
how this structure works but basically there is some risk that the collateral values of these structures
could fall below certain thresholds  in that case the securities would have to be liquidated  again
commercial paper investors are saying do i really want to see what this means  so they are
pulling back from that market as well  of the two the extendable commercial paper issue seems to
be the more immediate one in the markets attention but the siv assetbacked commercial paper is
also an ongoing issue
mr moskow  thank you
chairman bernanke  are there other questions for bill  if not we need a vote to
ratify domestic market operations
mr kohn  i move we ratify those operations
participant  second
chairman bernanke  objections  vincent has come in  welcome  we just want to
acknowledge you
mr reinhart  ever since you gave the guards guns i didnt really have any choice
laughter
chairman bernanke  we want to acknowledge your final meeting vincent  it has
been six years since vincent was elected secretary and economist to the committee  you took that
role only three or four weeks before september 11 and your steady hand during that crisis was
invaluable  unfortunately against all good advice and after only eightytwo fomc meetingsa
record which to his credit he has achieved without prompting accusations of steroid uselaughter
vincent is insisting upon returning to civilian life  so today is an appropriate occasion upon which
to express our gratitude vincent for your sage advice your thoughtful guidance and your
undoubtedly welldeserved admonitions to the committee over the years  vincents legacy of
course will live on in the meeting transcripts from his tenure as the transcripts become public over
the next few years  for example in the may 2004 transcript vincent is caught using the words
cattle prods in reference to a possible experiment involving bond market traders  laughter  in
2005 he suggested that the fomc as a group was incapable of agreeing on something as
straightforward as the color of an orange  laughter  notwithstanding that vincent the
committee does agree on this  you have our heartfelt thanks and our best wishes for the next stage
of your career  congratulations and many thanks  applause  is there a rebuttal  laughter  if
not we can go to the economic situation and i will call on david wilcox
mr wilcox  thank you mr chairman  in putting together the greenbook forecast for this meeting we adjusted our outlook in five ways in response to the developments that bill dudley has just described  first and foremost in terms of its implications for real activity we took on board the implications of the decline in the value of equities since the june greenbook  second we adjusted our homeprice forecast down a notch both in response to slightly disappointing indicators of home price appreciation during the second quarter and in recognition of the bleaker conditions in housing markets more generally including the developments in the subprime mortgage market  in all we took the level of home prices down 1 percent by the end of 2008 with about onethird of that amount representing our response to the incoming indicators and twothirds reflecting the other considerations  in combination and allowing for some relatively minor offsets the reduction in equity values and home prices took about 1 trillion off the balance sheet of the household sector and weakened our outlook for consumer spending through the usual wealth effect channels
third we further adjusted our forecast of real pce to allow for a direct effect of interestrate resets  we estimate that 47 million variablerate subprime loans are scheduled to undergo interestrate resets over the next year and a half  if all these resets were to take full effect they would result in extra interest payments cumulating
to about 12 billion between now and the end of 2008  for several reasons however we think that 12 billion figure represents a loose upper bound on the likely effect of resets on consumption spending  for example even in todays relatively more hostile financial environment some households will succeed in refinancing into a prime mortgage with a lower rate others will sell their property and become renters rather than bear the additional debt service payments and some who remain in their homes with no refinancing will have the financial wherewithal to shield their spending from a dollarfordollar reduction in response to the increase in debt service payments  in light of these considerations we took consumer spending down by half the amount of the resetinduced payments
fourth we adjusted down our forecast for newhome sales to allow for the unusual restraint that the tightening in mortgageborrowing conditions since the last greenbook will likely impose on the demand for new homes  the adjustment we made this time followed similar downward revisions in march and june together these three revisions were calibrated to unwind the boost to mortgage originations that we think was provided by nonprime lending in 2005 and 2006  overall we took the trajectory of newhome sales down 6 percent this roundhalf in response to the mortgage developments and half in response to the disappointing pace of sales data for june  having cut the pace of sales we then also took down the rate of new construction in the forecast to keep inventories of unsold new homes from bulging too much further
finally we trimmed our forecast for investment in equipment and software a bit on the theory that the increase in spreads that investmentgrade and especially non investmentgrade firms now are facing might reflect greater uncertainty in the business climate and that they might respond to that uncertainty by being a little more reluctant to invest  to be sure the econometric evidence supporting this hypothesis is not rock solid but it did strike us as suggestive enough to warrant a modest adjustment
all told these responses to the more hostile financial climate took about
 percentage point off our forecast for the growth of real gdp over the second half of this year and next with about half of that amount reflecting the changes working through the traditional wealth channel and the remainder representing the combined influence of the three less traditional adjustments
could the implications of the financial situation for the real economy be even worse than we have built into the baseline  you bet  i almost invariably resist the temptation to declare that uncertainty about the real economy is greater than usual but the current situation strikes me as the exception that proves the rule  in the alternative scenarios section of the greenbook we sketched three situations in which economic activity would be markedly weaker than in the baseline  in the first residential investment drops 10 percent relative to baseline by the middle of next year and home prices drop a total of 20 percent in nominal terms over the next year and a halfunprecedented in modern times but not outside the realm of possibility
as it would merely return the valuation of the housing stock to the level predicted by one of the houseprice models that we track  the second scenario adds a deterioration in consumer sentiment giving the meltdown in the housing sector an additional vehicle for spilling over into consumer spending more generally  in both of these scenarios financial conditions deteriorate relative to baseline but only to the extent judged normal by the model in light of the weaker overall economy  the third scenario adds a further and more virulent deterioration in financial conditions with a 10 percent decline in equity values and a 100 basis point widening in the spread on investmentgrade securities  in the third scenario we nearlythough not quitesucceed in generating a recession despite a substantial easing of monetary policy
on the other hand could it be better  a key objective in putting together this forecast has been to ensure that risk lies on both sides of the baseline forecast  for example yesterdays market rebound is a reminder that stranger things have happened than for calm to break out in financial markets  one cannot rule out that six months or a year from now we will look back on this episode much as we look back on the flareup in february of this year or as we look back on the stockmarket break in 1987 with a sense of surprise that the financial event did not leave a greater imprint on the real economy  even if the financial markets do not heal themselves quickly consumers may prove more willing to postpone the increase in the saving rate that we have assumed in the baseline businesses may aim to build the investment share of gdp back much closer to the levels that it attained in the late 1990s and home sales may recover more quickly than we have assumed
a second challenge that we faced in putting the forecast togethermore routine than the task of factoring in the implications of financialmarket developmentswas to take account of the annual revision to the national income and product accounts
as you know the bea revised down the growth of real gdp  percentage point on average in 2004 2005 and 2006  conveniently this time around the bea made only very small adjustments to their estimates of pce inflation  because the nipa revision gave us no new reason to revise our previous assessment of the pressures in product markets we took our estimate of potential output down in line with actual gdp thereby maintaining the gap between the two at its previous level as of the end of 2006  in line with our custom in years past we carried the revision to the growth of potential through into the forecast period  as a result we now have potential output increasing 2 percent in both 2007 and 2008
a virtue of the approach that we have taken in revising the supply side of the projection is that it leaves most of the variables you care about undisturbed  thanks to the bea inflation is essentially unrevised  because we moved potential down in line with actual the gdp gap and the unemployment rate trajectories are also essentially unrevised  and with real interest rates and the gdp gap about the same as before r is also roughly unrevised  in short if you make your policy decisions based on expected inflation and expected resource utilization your policy choices after the revision should be about the same now as they were before the revision
provided that you see the prospects for resource utilization as roughly the same now as they were before the revision  the one variable that is different of course in the projection as well as in history is the growth rate of real gdp  but a conventional analysis would view the revision to that variable as something you simply have to acceptnot something you can do anything about
in a statement that will strike you as reminiscent of other than that mrs
lincoln i would summarize the nonfinancial news that we received during the intermeeting period as having been remarkably consistent with our june projection on the downside the most notable development to be sure was in home sales both new and existing confirming the recent stepdown in housing demand  pending home salesour most reliable nearterm indicator of existinghome sales rebounded in june but to a level that is still well below its average in the first quarter even so were it not for the substantial disruption on the lending side the portrait of the housing sector that we would be reporting to you today would be substantially the same as the one we presented in june  elsewhere the data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in june were a little softer than we had expected  the slowdown in lightvehicle sales in july to 152 million units at an annual rate raises a warning flag but we are inclined at this point to interpret that result as a temporary pause rather than a harbinger of much weaker spending ahead  all that said last fridays employment report once again showed a little more momentum in hiring than we had expected and initial claims for unemployment insurance in the two weeks since the july survey week have remained low giving no sign of any material deterioration in labormarket conditions  the increase in the unemployment rate to
46 percent in july was not a surprise given the moderate pace of growth on average thus far this year  moreover the indicators that we have in hand put manufacturing ip on track to post a solid increase in july  all told the real economy seems to have entered the period of intense financialmarket turbulence with if anything a little more momentum than we would have projected at the time of the june meeting
on the inflation front the picture looks very much the same as it did at the time of the june greenbook  we still see the bulk of the improvement in core pce inflation during the second quarter as likely to prove transitory  in a nod to the relatively favorable recent monthly readings we trimmed our forecast for the second half of this year by 01 percentage point despite a number of factors that could put slightly  greater upward pressure on inflation including the slower pace of structural productivity growth the higher level of commodity prices and the uptick of a tenth in the michigan measure of longterm inflation expectations  next year as energy prices turn down slightly inflation expectations remain well contained and pressures on resource utilization ease slightly we continue to have core inflation edging down to a rate of 2 percent and we have topline inflation dipping slightly below the core rate to 18 percent for the year as a whole before coming back up in line with the core over the next two years  karen will now continue our presentation
ms johnson  the financial market turmoil over the intermeeting period has not been confined to us markets  in todays financially globalized world events in
one asset market frequently have consequences in other markets and other countries both the level and the volatility of asset prices abroad have moved with us asset market developments  equity prices are generally down although not in china
yields on longterm sovereign fixedincome securities are also generally down  cds spreads corporate bond spreads embi spreads and similar measures are generally up  with so much action happening in global financial markets you might have expected some major revisions to our outlook for foreign real growth and inflation
yet with the exception of revisions to some secondquarter numbers because of surprises from incoming data the baseline forecast this time is little changed from that in june
two reasons for the lack of significant macroeconomic consequences in the rest of the global economy from these financial events seem particularly noteworthy  one is that there is no sector abroad in any of the major regions that corresponds to the
us housing sector and its direct ties to credit problems related to subprime mortgages  the second reason is that we do not observe any telltale signs such as overexpansion by one or more industries or fragile household balance sheets that would suggest that some repricing of risky assets and perhaps some restraint in credit creation would trigger significant changes in real economic behavior of firms or households  the global economy expanded strongly in the first half of this year with the underlying strength broadly distributed across regions and sectors  as a result it is in robust condition and is likely able to withstand the adjustment proceeding in financial markets without substantial risk to continued real expansion or creation of inflationary pressures  of course we cannot be certain that continued or more intense disorderly conditions in financial markets will not trigger a negative macroeconomic reaction nor do we know for sure that problems are not already present but are not yet visible to us  so we see the events of the past several weeks as giving rise to an abundance of downside risk to our forecast of real activity rather than to changes in the baseline
despite a basically unchanged outlook for the rest of the global economy two elements of the international forecast merit some further discussion  global oil market developments over the intermeeting period and the staffs judgment that us real imports of goods and services will expand at a rate about 1 percentage point lower than we projected in june  on july 31 the spot price for wti rose above 78 per barrel and attracted attention for having reached a new peak value  although that price subsequently moved back down somewhat the spot wti price was about 7 per barrel higher on the day we finalized the greenbook forecast than it was on the comparable day in june  in part the upward shift in the spot wti price reflected an unwinding of most of the unusual discount for wti relative to brent and other grades of oil that persisted from midmarch until recently as a result of large inventories of wti at certain locations  by comparison the spot price for brent crude oil rose nearly 4 per barrel over the same interval  the upward pressure on spot prices appeared to arise from the supply side with production restraint by opec a factor
however although prices moved up noticeably at the front of the curve futures prices for oil dated later this year and early next year moved up much less and
futures prices for crude oil in late 2008 and beyond actually moved down  as a consequence the oil futures curve returned to what is called backwardation meaning that the spot price is above futures prices which tend to flatten out at more distant dates  putting all this together our forecast for the us oil import price is more than 4 per barrel higher for the very near term than it was in june but it is little changed over 2008  so the impact of higher oil prices on our trade deficit is limited whereas some upward push to consumer prices abroad might result from the recent increases in crude oil prices our expectation based on futures markets that they will prove transitory means that few sustained pressures on inflation should result
our forecast for the growth of total us imports of goods and services has been revised down about 1 percentage point for the second half of this year and nearly that much for next  the resulting annual growth rates of 2 percent in the near term and 3 percent next year are about 3 percentage points below the growth we are projecting for real exports of goods and services  although in the near term slightly weaker projected imports for oil and natural gas are part of the story further out weaker growth in imported core goods and services largely account for the revision  for these two categories the downward revision reflects the changes in this forecast to the projected level of the dollar and to the path for us real gdp
we have made some small adjustments to our outlook for the constituent currencies in our broad dollar index that by chance are offsetting leaving the staff forecast for the rate of depreciation of our real broad dollar index going forward about the same as in june  however the depreciation of the dollar that has already occurred since your june meeting resulted in a downward shift in the currentquarter starting value for our forecast path of about 1 percent  that real depreciation works to restrain imports of core goods and of services somewhat especially in the near term parenthetically it also has a stimulative effect on our exports of core goods and services
the lower path for us gdp growth going forward is the primary explanation of our downward revision to projected import growth  with us gdp now expected to grow at an annual rate of 2 percent rather than 2 percent imports of both core goods and services decelerate more than in proportion as our best estimate of the income elasticities for each of these categories is above 1  of course the baseline path for us real gdp takes into account the lower imports and the simultaneous nature of the determination of gdp and its components  but the information contained in the annual revision to past us gdp growth and the prospect of lower potential gdp going forward was news to our import model and led us to make the downward revisions i have just described  with growth of real exports of goods and services revised up only slightly their positive contribution to real gdp growth is just a bit more positive  in contrast the negative contribution from real imports is now significantly smaller in absolute value  as a result the overall arithmetic contribution from real net exports to real gdp growth over the forecast period is positive at an annual rate of about  percentage point  such an outcome would mean that real net exports have contributed or will contribute positively to real gdp growth in each of
2006 2007 and 2008  from the perspective of real gdp a positive contribution from real net exports is one very reasonable criterion for external adjustment should it be sustained  brian will now continue our presentation
mr madigan2  i will be referring to the handout labeled material for fomc briefing on trialrun projections  as in shown line 1 of the top panel of exhibit 1 the central tendency of your current forecasts for real gdp growth for the second half of 2007 is 20 to 27 percent  combined with the beas estimate of 20 percent growth in the first half your projections imply a central tendency for the year of 20 to 23 percent down 02 percentage point from the june trial run  the growth rates for 2008 and 2009 were revised down by a similar amount and now center on about
25 percent  as can be seen by comparing rows 3 and 4 the central tendencies of the projections for the unemployment rates at the end of 2007 2008 and 2009 are essentially the same as in june  the downward revisions to real gdp growth together with the unchanged forecasts for unemployment suggest that like the staff many of you revised down your estimates of potential gdp growth about  percentage point still as in june fomc participants generally are a bit more optimistic than the staff about potential growth  indeed many of you made those points in your forecast narratives  as shown in row 5 the central tendency for core pce inflation for the second half of 2007 is 19 to 21 percent  together with the 19 percent rate for the first half this implies a central tendency of 19 to 20 percent core inflation for the 2007 as a whole down slightly from the june projections  the central tendencies for the next two years are nearly identical to those in june with the midpoint edging down over time  the central tendencies for total pce inflation line 7 collected for the first time in the current exercise are similar to those for core inflation for 2008 and 2009  the central tendencies of your projections for core inflation this year and next lie just below the corresponding staff forecasts and the central tendencies of your projections for unemployment late this year and next are also just below the staff forecasts  these comparisons suggest that many of you have a somewhat lower estimate of nairu than the staffs estimate of 50 percent a point that some of you made explicitly in your narratives

in earlier discussions of the role that your projections might play in enhancing the committees communications some of you noted that extending the time horizon for your projections would give the public more information about your estimates of potential gdp growth and your judgments about optimal or acceptable trend inflation  to the extent that argument is correct the 11 percentage point range of your projections for gdp growth in 2009 shown in line 1 of the middle panel of exhibit 1 suggests noticeable dispersion in your views of potential growth though those growth rates may also be affected by projected adjustments toward inflation rates that you see as desirable  the range of your projections for total inflation in 2009 line 7 is not quite as wide suggesting somewhat greater commonality in your views about the rate of inflation consistent with price stability and the range for your core inflation forecasts in 2009 line 5 is a bit narrower remaining at 15 to 2 percent

2  materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
as shown in the bottom panel most of you again characterized the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as broadly similar to the greenbook assumption  as in june a few of you assumed a modestly lower path for the federal funds rate evidently reflecting expectations of morefavorable aggregate supply conditions than in the greenbook forecast while two assumed an increase in the fed funds rate later this year or early next year followed by a reduction to foster more disinflation
exhibit 2 summarizes the results on uncertainty and skews  you were asked to characterize your judgment of the uncertainty attached to your projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past twenty years and to indicate your judgment of the riskweighting around your projections  as shown in the top two panels about two thirds of you see uncertainty about growth as broadly similar to that experienced historically and see the risks around your growth projections as broadly balanced
compared with the situation in june however a few more of you see greater uncertainty than historically and a few more view the risks as tilted to the downside similarly with regard to the outlook for unemployment not shown noticeably more of you than in june see the risks as tilted to the upside  with respect to core inflation the middle two charts show that almost all of you again judge that the uncertainty attached to your projections is similar to past levels while the number of you who see the risks as tilted to the upside edged down  as shown in the bottom panels your judgments about the uncertainty and risks for total inflation are nearly the same as those for core inflation
i would like to end on a personal note  as the chairman noted vincent reinhart will be leaving us  vincent joined the boards staff in 1988  for a while debbie danker and i oversaw vincents work but before long don and the board recognized prodigious talent and eventually the tables were turned  laughter  the chairman has already indicated how the board and the fomc have benefited from vincents unparalleled expertise and work ethic  but i want to note that we on the staff have benefited equally from vincents generous contributions to our research current analysis and policy work and from his insightful and creative approaches to dayto day management issues  finally vincents eclectic wardrobe was useful to the staff in generating random numbers for stochastic model simulations  laughter  on any given day for any given occasion whether he would choose to show up snazzy or shabby was perfectly unpredictable  vincent all members of the federal reserve staff have been proud to be associated with you  we will miss you  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  were now open for questions for the staff
president fisher
mr fisher  i noted karens comments about the globalized interlinkages with financial
markets and i have a simple question for maybe karen  in terms of the alternative scenario that
was sketched for greater housing correction to spill over to confidence in financial markets in that
discussion and in that model or simulation when you talk about equity prices stresses in the debt
markets and further weakness in aggregate spending are you talking about the united states only
ms johnson  yes
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  are there other questions  president lacker
mr lacker  david when you were describing the implications of the gdp revisions for
your assessment of the output gap you said that you essentially marked down potential by the same
amount as realized growth recently based on your assessment of pressures in product markets  in
case we wanted to try it at home i was wondering if you could say a little more about what data that
assessment of pressures in product markets relies on
mr wilcox  it relies on a variety of considerations but ultimately i would say it relies
on inflation performance  one way that we have of assessing whether our gauges of resource
utilization are moving off track is to look back and see whether our inflation models that incorporate
those measures of resource utilization are overpredicting or underpredicting  its an imperfect
mechanism to be sure because the impulse from resource utilization to inflation is very weak
therefore an error in estimation on our part of the pressures on resource utilization would show up
in a discrepancy in the inflation projection that could easily be lost in the noise  but thats probably
the main approach that we take to attempting to gauge ultimately whether or not were off base  in
putting together our assessment of the output gap we also attempt to maintain some alignment of
that measure with the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate or the nairu  our
analysis of the nairu factors in as well a more fundamental inspection of things like demographic
influences including disability rates and the age composition of the population  so there is an effort
to bring to bear an independent analysis of some of the economic determinants that might be
moving the nairu up or down
mr lacker  i guess my question was motivated by my sense that estimates of the
current output gap tend to play an important role in your outlook for nearterm inflation trends  to
the extent that the current estimate of the output gap is derived from current inflation i am
wondering if it provides less independent information than current inflation about future inflation
than one might otherwise have thought
mr wilcox  i would make two remarks regarding that  first quantitatively in fact the
output gap doesnt play a very large role in shifting our projection of inflation  if one does a sort of
retrospective decomposition of the factors that were generating inflation over the past ten fifteen or
twenty years during the period of the great moderation gaps in resource utilization are at most a
modest contributor to the variance in inflation  econometrically speaking a very important
determinant of inflation variability is just shocks that push inflation and that our model has no ready
attribution for  so they are not directly attributable to relative energy price movements relative
import prices resource utilization or inflation expectations but just stuff happening that moves
inflation around  so your point is correct in principle but quantitatively i think it has a very modest
influence on our current projection  second we enforce a good deal of smoothness so that we are
not by any means soaking up the residual in the inflation equation that emerges in one period by
saying oh that must have reflected a variation in potential output growth in order to drive the
residual to zero  we are allowing that residual to persist and to inform our assessment of potential
output growth only over time and with an accumulation of evidence
chairman bernanke  other questions  well begin our economic goround then
for president rosengrens benefitas you probably know if we have a comment or a question for
a speaker we use a twohanded symbol for an intervention  i would like to begin the goround
today with president moskow
mr moskow  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the seventh district have
changed little since our last meeting  we continue to lag the nation largely because of
difficulties in the auto industry  our contacts thought that the us economy had softened a little
since june but that international sales continue to be strong  they also voiced continuing
concerns about input cost pressures  there is no good news to report on residential construction
some of my contacts again pushed back their expectations on when housing markets would
begin to improve and are now saying later in 2008  we did hear some upbeat comments from
our directors about nonresidential construction in the district but manufacturers of heavy
equipment indicated that they were seeing less demand for products that are used in
nonresidential construction  we also heard some lessoptimistic reports about consumer
spending  a major shopping center developer and operator scaled back his expectations for the
second half of this year and now thinks that spending will be softer than in the first half  in
addition a large national specialty retailer saw a broadbased slowing in its sales over the past
six weeks  still no one was overly pessimistic  in our own forecast we assume that the
weakness in consumption relative to trend during the second quarter was largely transitory
perhaps a reaction to the runup in gasoline prices
regarding the motor vehicle sector the major topic of discussion is the current labor
negotiations and the possibility of a strike in september  i get the sense that the odds of a
walkout are small because both the automakers and the uaw think that a strike would be very
damaging  as our director who heads the michigan aflcio noted a strike would be mutually
assured destruction  the uaw realizes that the negotiations are occurring against the backdrop
of very bad economic conditions in the traditional automaking regions  for example since 2000
michigan has lost 400000 jobs  thats an 8 percent decline in employment  a strike would
be seen as just adding to these economic woes  so from all my discussions with management
and labor my impression is that the climate for change underlying these negotiations is stronger
than it has been in the past but i am not sure how big a move the uaw leadership thinks it can
get approved by its members
of course the major development affecting the forecast since the last round is the turmoil
in credit markets that we were talking about earlier  our director who runs a major private
equity firm made a number of interesting comments regarding the difficulties that banks were
having selling off loans that had been made to risky borrowers with extremely beneficial terms
such as covenantlite and an option to accrue interest charges  the bottom line is that he thought
that after the current shakeout there would be fewer buyouts and that pricing and terms would
become more reflective of risk  going forward it seems likely that the market will favor so
called strategic buyers the nonfinancial firms that are looking for acquisitions that would
directly enhance the efficiency and scale of their business operations  so while we are concerned
about the negative implications of tighter credit conditions markets may now do a better job in
pricing the tradeoff between risk and return which is a positive development
so how might these financial developments affect the real economy  if sustained the
fallout of credit market jitters on the stock market and other assets would weigh on spending
through the standard wealtheffect channels  with regard to the credit markets themselves the
key question is how many of the deals that are now being canceled or scaled back would have
resulted in an expansion of business activity as opposed to simply transferring ownership  given
the modest changes in interest rates on higherrated debt continued growth in ci lending and
ample internal funds of nonfinancial firms the cost of capital for most investment projects
probably has not risen substantially  so the firstorder effects on spending will likely be limited
of course this could change quickly in the current volatile markets and we will need to monitor
these developments carefully or should i say you will need to monitor these developments
carefully  laughter  however right now putting all these factors together we view the
developments in credit markets as a risk to the nearterm forecast but not a reason to lower the
outlook for growth very much  that said we like the greenbook have marked down our
assumptions concerning potential  we now see potential as a bit above 2 percent  however
relative to potential our forecast for real activity is not much different from last round  we see
growth averaging close to potential in the second half of 07 which is stronger than the
greenbook but running a touch below potential in 08 and 09 which is similar to the
greenbook
our inflation forecast also has not changed much since june  we still see core pce
prices increasing a shade below 2 percent by 2009  but i must say i remain concerned about the
inflation forecast  the standard list of upside risksthe lack of resource slack cost pass
throughs inflation expectationsthese could break the wrong way and require a policy
response  so if potential output growth is in fact significantly lower than our earlier
assessment then you could face some challenges in calibrating policy as the economy and
economic agents adjust to the lower trend in productivity growth
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  data on inflation during the intermeeting
period have continued to be encouraging but the prospects for economic activity have become
dicier  the results for gdp in the second quarter as a whole actually took on a positive tone
with final sales mainly accounting for the healthy growth rate  but the quarter ended on a weak
note with disappointing data for housing consumption and for orders of core capital goods  of
course the big developments since our last meeting were in financial markets  i read them as
pointing to weaker growth going forward and greater downside risk  the market for mortgage
backed securities is now highly illiquid and there are indications that credit problems are spilling
beyond the subprime sector  it thus seems likely that lending standards will tighten for a broader
class of borrowers in the mortgage market
the drop in equity prices and rising rates on most risky corporate debt are further
negatives for growth  there are some offsets to these negative factors including the decline in
the dollar and most important the steep reduction we have seen in riskfree rates  on balance
however i expect these offsets to be only partial providing a cushion against future weakness
because i interpret the decline in treasury rates during the intermeeting period primarily as a
reflection of weaker growth expectations and a correspondingly lower path for the expected
future fed funds rate and not a consequence of the fall of the term premium  the jump in oil
prices since our last meeting is a further factor weighing on aggregate demand  as a result of
these considerations i have lowered my growth forecast for the second half of this year
 percentage point to just over 2 percent  this rate is moderately below my estimate of
potential growth which i now put at about 2 percent
going beyond this year the outlook depends on ones assumption concerning appropriate
monetary policy  i consider it appropriate for policy to aim at holding growth just slightly below
potential to produce enough slack in labor and credit markets to help bring about a further
gradual reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability  barring a more
serious and prolonged tightening of credit market conditions or a general liquidity squeeze i
would keep the fed funds rate modestly above its equilibrium level to accomplish this goal
however i now see the fed funds rate as well above the neutral level  so i think it likely that the
fed funds rate will need to fall appreciably over the next few years  my assessment of the neutral
federal funds rate declined during the intermeeting period for two main reasonsfirst because
of the tightening in financial conditions associated with the reassessment of risk now taking
place and second because of the nipa revisions which suggest slower structural productivity
growth and in all likelihood correspondingly slower growth in aggregate demand  i thus think
that a larger decline in the fed funds rate will be needed over time than in the greenbook baseline
to achieve a soft landing
a key development during the intermeeting period was the downward revision of real
gdp growth over the 200406 period  this adjustment reinforces the work of productivity
experts at the board and elsewhere who had previously found evidence of a slowdown in
underlying productivity growth  the revision in actual productivity was big enough to lead us to
lower our estimate of growth in both structural productivity and potential output although our
estimates remain above those in the greenbook  in addition to tighter financial conditions lower
structural productivity growth was the reason that we lowered our forecast for real gdp growth
to 2 percent in 2008  as a result the unemployment rate edges up in our forecast reaching
nearly 5 percent by the end of next year  the modest amount of slack that this entails should
help bring about the desired gradual reduction of inflation in the future
readings on core pce prices have been quite tame for some time now rising only
01 percent in each of the past four months  although a portion of the recent deceleration in core
prices likely reflects transitory influences the underlying trend in core inflation still appears
favorable  we anticipate that the core pce price index will rise 2 percent this year and that core
inflation will gradually ebb to around 18 percent over the forecast period  this forecast is
predicated on continued wellanchored inflation expectations and the eventual appearance of a
small amount of labor market slack as i just mentioned
for some time now ive thought an argument could be made that the nairu was a bit
lower than assumed in the greenbook and the new evidence that structural productivity growth
has been lower than we thought for more than three years reinforces this view  it means that the
relatively good inflation performance over this period occurred despite the upward pressure that
must have been operating because of the deceleration in structural productivity  in any event i
also expect to see modest downward pressure on inflation in the next couple of years from the
ebbing of the upward effects of special factors including the decline in structural productivity
energy and commodity prices and owners equivalent rent
in terms of risk to the outlook for growth the housing sector obviously remains a serious
concern  we seem to be repeatedly surprised with the depth and duration of the deterioration in
these markets and the financial fallout from developments in the subprime markets which i now
perceive to be spreading beyond that sector is a source of appreciable angst  of course
financial conditions have deteriorated in markets well beyond those connected with subprime
instruments or even residential real estate more generally  it appears that participants are
questioning structured credit products in general the risk assessments of the rating agencies and
the extent of due diligence by originators who package and sell loans but no longer hold a very
sizable fraction of these originations on their own balance sheets  the greenbook has long
highlighted and we have long worried about the possibility and potential consequences of a
broader shift in risk perceptions  with risk premiums having been so low by historical standards
it would hardly be surprising to see them rise making financial conditions tighter for any given
stance of monetary policy  while it remains possible that financial markets will stabilize or even
reverse course in the days and weeks ahead the possibility that the financial markets are now
shifting to a historically more typical pattern of risk pricing is very much on my radar screen
should this pattern persist and possibly intensify it will have very important implications for
policy
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman at the past few meetings i have spoken about my district
as having strong growth  i have asked questions about the strength of the growth in the national
economy and i have described the global economy from the standpoint of the way the staff here
writes about it and the way we do our own work as hotter than a 2 pistol  nothing has really
changed since my last intervention  i would note that unlike president moskows district our
district is unusual on the other side  we are not experiencing the kind of decline in home prices
that is being experienced elsewhere  were suffering from widespread labor shortages for both
unskilled and skilled labor  we believe that we are seeing significant labor hoarding in our
district  unemployment is strikingly and historically low in the two major cities of dallas and
houston at 41 percent in austin at 35 percent and along the border areas unprecedentedly in
the low single digits  salaries for accountants in our district are up 5 to 8 percent  law firmsi
note that there are 12 million lawyers in america and 11 million people who work in the auto
industry from parts to final assembly which is a statement on our societylaughter are raising
first and secondyear annual compensation by double digits for their new lawyers  so there is
still price inflation in the service sector  we perceive through our discussions with ceos
around the country that while there has been a net downward movement in the morerobust
measurements of price inflationthe trimmed meanthere still are some threats on the inflation
front  for example the ceo of walmart usa told me yesterday that internally when they
evaluate their comparable store measurements the comps are being driven by inflation not by
volume  as for the demand for shipsif you read the wall street journal yesterday or from the
interviews i have had with large shippers the bulk carriers are trading at record highs  the
baltic index is at a record high driven by exports of iron ore pulp and other products to
voracious chinese demand and by the return of exports from china to a voracious european
demand  container shipments are up 20 percent year over year in terms of european imports
the price pressures being exerted there seem to be invading other areas  one of the more
interesting observations was what has happened recently in terms of the pricing of paper
products being led by sca which is a european corporation  kimberlyclark and the others
have fallen in line  they are asking for doubledigit increases  so although we are seeing some
mitigation of price pressures i am nonetheless concerned that given the international dynamics
we still have the potential for price increases and a bit of resistance to what i would like to see
in terms of economic growth nationally i just want to comment on some things that the
staff presented  i thought the greenbook was excellent  i did speak to two of the five largest
publicly held builders  they report that allin with incentives their prices have been marked
down an average of 25 to 35 percent from a year ago  those are significant numbers  for
example in the imperial valley of california homes selling for 550000 to 600000 have been
now marked down to 400000 to 450000  the builder with the most experienceforty years
of experiencewho has lived through all kinds of cycles is of the strong belief that we are in the
second year of a fiveyear correction  like the point that you made president yellen this is of
great concern  so net from the dallas fed standpoint we have lowered our expectation for
secondhalf growth to 2 percent  we are still concerned despite the encouragement of marginal
movement on the inflation front  id like to leave the discussion of the economy there and just
turn to the previous discussion we had and the references made by president moskow and
president yellen
this may be a bit harsh but if you look at the front page of the wall street journal from
this morning i see what i call the churchillian maxim at play which is i shall fare well in
history because i shall rewrite that history  whether you use greg ip to rewrite the history or
you rewrite it yourself no amount of rewriting of history will exonerate us if we are not prepared
for the moredire scenarios that were presented by the staff  i would ask that we do some
scenario preparation in terms of should we encounter increased financial market turbulence
what actions we might take to deal with it  for example it is not clear to me that a widespread
opening of the discount window solves the problem given the structure of what i call ersatz
credit that is then spread throughout the system  its not clear to me that even dealing for
purposes of the present meeting with the fed funds rate is the issue because it is not an issue of
just pricing in the marketplace  its a structure issue and its a covenant issue  its an
availability issue
i started my career mr chairman with herstatt  laughter  that was not an auspicious
beginning  i lived through the corrections of the sl market portfolio insurance the crashes of
87 97 and so on  when you sort through them all of them have a common basis and that is a
search for greater yields or greater return leverage in order to achieve that return and some
assumption of risk mitigation leading to what i call rational complacency  i believe thats at
play presently  i agree fully with president yellen that it presents a significant risk  however i
want to exercise great caution in interpreting these signals  i think we have to be extremely
careful about what we do and what we say  just to show my hand i would not be in favor of
cutting the federal funds rate at this juncture  i think we have to analyze the language carefully
but my request is that in addition to our exercise on communication we take a serious look at
the various scenarios that might obtain so that no one could ever accuse us of being unprepared
in case the worst obtains  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you president fisher  just to respond very briefly
we do have a group here at the board working with other economists and financial experts
throughout the system that does scenario analysis and does monitor the markets and we
certainly are quite attuned to these issues
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  the reports that i am hearing from
business leaders in the fourth district lead me to conclude that the pace of economic activity
hasnt changed a great deal since our last meeting  however the uncertainties surrounding the
business climate seem to have risen measurably  the troubled housing sector is still weighing on
the region as it is nationally  i now have little doubt that this theme is going to recur throughout
the balance of the year and perhaps well beyond  my view of the housing sector conforms
closely to the way housing is depicted in the greenbook baseline but i have had many
conversations in the past few weeks with anxious industry insiders who believe that housing
markets are likely to worsen substantially over the balance of the year with the possibility of
significant spillovers to other sectors of the economy  the stories they tell me sound a lot like
the greater housing correction scenarios that are depicted in the greenbook  indeed casualties in
the mortgage markets are rising and i am hearing more and more that the fallout from housing is
affecting deals in other sectors of the economy  for example i talked with a ceo who runs a
large national real estate development company  he told me that some of his projects are being
held up by his investment bankers inability to price deals and to bring them to market  where
the deals can be priced risk spreads have widened across a range of issuers and financial
instruments  this ceos comments are very much in line with the points that bill dudley made
in his report earlier this morning
because of these uncertainties in financial markets some of my contacts confirm that
they have been reevaluating their capital formation plans  they are trimming their projections of
some of the projects that they are going to put on the books and that led me to trim my
projection for business fixed investment accordingly  even with this adjustment however i am
concerned that the pattern of business investment that i have incorporated into my gdp
projections for this meeting may still be somewhat optimistic  this is a risk to the outlook that
was not on my radar screen at our last meeting
the june retail price measures gave us more evidence that the inflation trend may be
coming down  inflation moderated in the second quarter as measured by the median cpi and
the 16percent trimmed mean that we produce at the cleveland fed  i am not yet persuaded that
this progress will be sustained but the patterns in the june data were promising  my projection
for inflation in the outyears of the forecast are actually a little more favorable than what is in the
greenbook baseline primarily because i still expect a bit more potential gdp growth than the
greenbook envisions  so i am feeling more comfortable about the inflation risks than i have felt
for a while but less comfortable about the realside risks  my overall risk assessment is moving
closer into balance  nevertheless i still think that inflation is the predominant risk we face
today  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well as best i can judge recent readings on
the economy are generally consistent with anticipation of moderate growth and some gradual
diminution or at least no deterioration in inflation  secondquarter gdp readings as far as i can
tell contain no big surprises  in particular the components of aggregate demand that were
expected to bounce back after periods of sluggishness or in some cases correctioninventory
accumulation spending on equipment and software and federal government outlaysall in fact
did bounce back as anticipated  the labor market report for july was positive and anecdotes and
indicators in our district are generally quite consistent with the tenor of that report  the labor
market appears to be healthy  job availability appears to be ample  the labor market overall i
would say is strong
of course all of that is by way of background because that information has been
overshadowed in recent weeks by what i think are three or four developments of greater
significance one of which is the revision to the nipa accounts  the gdp and productivity data
and in particular the downward revision to productivity may have significant implications for
the longerterm performance of the economy  i wont dwell on that now  dave wilcox covered
some of that earlier  there was also an upward revision to the personal saving rate which
possibly has implications for the outlook for consumer spending going forward and i will come
to that briefly in a moment  of course the big headlines have been the turbulence in the
financial markets and all the uncertainty associated with the duration of the repricing and the
adjustments that are under way and their quantitative significance for the performance of the
economy going forward  this turbulence in the financial markets is likely the most significant
development for the shortterm performance of the economy and possibly for policy  but at this
point it is very difficult to put it mildly to assess its effects for reasons i alluded to earlier
namely that we dont know how long this will last and what will follow in its wake  even if we
knew the duration would we beat least would i beall that confident that we could go from
that to the magnitude of the effects on the economy  so all of that suggests to me that we should
have a good deal of caution at the moment  since we dont it seems to me know enough to act
decisively we certainly dont want to overreact or to act wrongly in these circumstances  these
developments really have taken hold forcefully in the past several weeks  the situation has not
been so dramatic for any extended period of time
returning to the saving rate for a moment i am quite cautious about drawing
implications for consumer spending on the basis of a judgment about whether the saving rate is
likely to go up or down  an argument has been popular in some circles that with the negative
saving rate as reported until recently in the data the implications for consumer spending were
likely that spending was going to be sluggish going forward because the negative saving rate
couldnt persist  it seems to me that the argument now at a minimum has to be less compelling
and so other things being equal we might be tempted to become more optimistic about
consumer spending  that could be swamped of course by the negative wealth effects coming
out of the adjustments in the financial markets and the tighter financial market conditions as
well  on net i guess i come out where i usually do on thisthat it is mostly a matter of
employment and incomesand so far so good on that score
finally and this is the fourth development that i will mentionalthough i dont think its
as important as the other three but i did want to comment on itit looks as though as part of the
revisions to the nipa accounts the increase in unit labor costs will be revised up for the
previous three yearsthat is for 04 05 and 06  i think thats right  now this is a matter of
correlation and not causation but it does appear that there is a pretty high correlation in the short
run between unit labor costs and inflation  that observation flashes a bit of a warning light on
our expectations of a fundamental slowing of inflation over time  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman the tenth district economy overall continues to perform
well with strength in energy and agriculture partially offset by the weaknesses in residential
construction  developments since the last meeting include some softening in district
manufacturing activity similar to that shown in the july ism survey numbers and in other
regional reserve bank indexes  we have also seen a slowing in overall employment growth  in
contrast consumer spending seems to be holding well in spite of higher gasoline prices  indeed
reports from district directors and business contacts indicate a strong summer tourism season
with increased air traffic and higher hotel occupancy rates throughout the western part of our
region  the recent slowing in district employment growth has been somewhat surprising to us
given the activity in much of our region  since the beginning of 2004 district employment
growth has been running around 2 percent and in the past few months has slowed to about 1
percent  geographically the slowdown has been most notable in wyoming new mexico
colorado and oklahoma and anecdotal information suggests that the slower growth is due more
to a shortage of skilled and semiskilled labor than to any weakening in demand  this anecdotal
information is supported by new regional information on employment costs by the bls
according to them recent employment cost increases in these states have been well above
increases nationally and in other parts of our region
construction activity remains mixed with weakness in residential construction offset to
some extent by strength in commercial construction  just an aside when you talk about things
that are on the horizon we are a little concerned about commercial real estate because it is very
hot right now and there is a fairly large portion of it on the books of the banks in our region  on
the residential side there is considerable variation across our region  in some areas where
energy and agriculture are strong housing activity is actually above normal  in other parts of the
district however both national and local developers are experiencing the most difficult
conditions in some time  in most district metro areas inventories of unsold homes continue to
rise but the rate of increase has diminished somewhat in recent months
turning to the national outlook data released since the last meeting support the view that
growth will pick up over the year  compared with the greenbook i am more optimistic about
both the nearterm outlook and longerrun growth  specifically i think secondhalf growth is
likely to be around 2 percent  growth in 2008 and 2009 is likely to be near potential which we
estimate to be around 2 percent  housing obviously constitutes the major downside risk to
growth over the next few quarters  i am not yet convinced however that recent financial market
volatility and repricing of credit risk will have significant implications for the growth outlook  it
is still reasonable at this point to think that the recent volatility will prove transitory and the
repricing of credit risk is in that sense desirable  i am also encouraged by the results of the july
senior loan officer survey which suggests no general tightening of bank credit conditions  like
the bluebook i think that treasury yields are likely to move back up once the markets feel more
comfortable about the state of the economy and credit conditions and realize that policy easing is
not likely to be forthcoming  although weakness in housing and tighter credit conditions have
increased the downside risk to output i believe that strength in consumer spending exports and
government spending will help maintain moderate growth in the period ahead
with regard to the inflation outlook recent data on core cpi and pce continue to be
favorable  however i am expecting some passthrough of higher energy prices to temporarily
boost core measures over the second half of this year  in addition pressures from resource
utilization and slow productivity growth remain  thus despite recent improvements i continue
to believe that some upside risk to inflation remains  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  since our last meeting the news in the third
district has been generally positive  economic activity continues to expand in the tristate area but
at a less rapid pace than at our previous meeting  our business outlook survey indicates that the
districts manufacturing output continued to expand in july although at a somewhat slower pace
than in june  the june measure you may recall was more than 18 in our business outlook survey
the highest level that it had been since april 2005  in july the index dropped to a little over 9
although it was still significantly positive  shipments of new orders increased in july and the
outlook for manufacturers own capital spending plans remains positive and is at a level typical of
an expansion  firms in our survey generally see improvements in their businesses coming in the
second half of the year  residential construction however continues to be very weak in the region
but we have not seen at least according to ofheo indexes any absolute price declines in our area
this is confirmed by our business contacts who report that they have not seen steep or broadbased
declines in house prices except for properties along the jersey shore where the boom was most
prevalent  at our last meeting i characterized the nonresidential investment market as firm and that
characterization continues today  office vacancy rates in the philadelphia region remain very low
and declining and rents in office and warehouse spaces remain at a record high  although reports
on retail sales in our region have been mixed sales appear to have improved somewhat in late june
and early july especially at higherend retail establishments
bank lending has continued to advance but at a more moderate pace than at the time of our
last meeting  our banking and other business contacts indicate that banks have money to lend to
customers with good credit ratings and so i dont get the sense that area businesses are facing a
credit crunch of the normal type  banks are comfortable with their lending standards and do not
expect to make any big changes along this dimension in the foreseeable future  for the most part
our banks were not in the subprime business and obviously dont intend to start now laughter and
thus they have not seen an appreciable deterioration in their balance sheets or in those of the
businesses to which they lendtheir customers  clearly there is nervousness but as yet there seem
to be few consequences for the real economy
june employment growth in the region was below trend but the regions unemployment rate
remains relatively low  our staff expects employment to continue to grow at a moderate pace going
forward and expects the regions unemployment rate perhaps to rise modestly by the second quarter
of next year  yet businesses continue to report tight labor markets  one very large builder who is
headquartered in our area and who builds mostly highend homes has actually reported that he
cannot finish a number of homes that he has under contract and that buyers are waiting to move
into  he cannot find labor  because of the crackdown on illegal immigrants who do a lot of the
landscaping a lot of roofing work and all the labor that goes into finishing these homes he cannot
hire these workers and so he actually has to put off closing deals because he cannot find workers to
complete the homes
on the inflation front in the district employment costs in the northeast are increasing at
about the same pace as in the nation  area manufacturers continue to report higher production
costs but there is relatively little evidence of passthrough of those higher costs to customers as they
see it  consumer prices are growing more slowly in the region than in the nation  so in summary
the third district economy continues to expand at a moderate pace  while there is nervousness
caused by the recent volatility in the financial markets businesses do not yet see that affecting their
current growth or prospects for future growth  business contacts as well as the philadelphia staff
expect this moderate pace of expansion to be continued in the coming months
at the national level the news has been mixed  on the positive side employment and
income growth remain solid  manufacturing output continues to improve and core inflation and
inflation expectations remain contained although both remain higher than i would like to see in the
long run  on the negative side news on business fixed investment and housing has been
disappointing  after encouraging signs of stabilization early in the year the sales of both new and
existing homes have continued to decline  sales of homes declined 66 percent in june and almost 8
percent in the second quarter  at the time of our last meeting i expressed the view that i was
getting hopeful that economy was on track to return to neartrend growth later this year  setting
aside the issue that our perception of longterm trend growth in real gdp may need reassessment in
light of the benchmark revisions as weve been discussingand ill return to this point in a
momentthe recent data on housing are suggestive of a weaker third quarter and perhaps fourth
quarter as well  though i think the underlying steadystate demand for housing is lower than the
pace of housing demand before we saw the downturn begin which implies that much of the
adjustment in housing supply is part of a healthy adjustment to a new equilibrium the stock of
unsold homes continues to cause a drag on residential investment  i also think that there is some
risk of temporary weakness in business fixed investment going forward simply because of increased
uncertainty  so the return to trend growth which i think will happen within the forecast period
may be delayed by a few quarters and may not get under way solidly until late in the first half of
next year  you know the old saying  if you cant forecast well forecast often  laughter
the biggest economic news headlines since our last meeting have focused on the volatility
of the financial markets and the repricing of risk  i am inclined to put minimal weight on the current
financial conditions for a slowdown in the pace of economic activity going forward  although risk
spreads have widened in the past three weeks or so the cost of capital for high quality borrowers
has hardly changed and remains relatively low by historical standards  this suggests to me that
what we are seeing in the marketplaceat least right now but which could change as weve all
notedis a change in the relative price of various measures of types of risk  the cost of capital for
some borrowers is increased but demand for business investments that originate from large
corporations with good credit ratings has not changed and is not likely to be adversely affected very
much in the repricing of risk if thats what this represents  this news was reinforced to me by my
conversations with area bankers as i mentioned earlier who say that they have plenty of money to
lend to good credit risks  there is no evidence of a general credit crunch from their point of view
my general view regarding the limited nature of the credit repricing is reinforced by the fact that
default rates on auto loans credit cards and other types of consumer debt instruments have not
changed much suggesting that the spillover effects at least to date have not been very measurable
thus i think that the decline in the subprime market is primarily a result of lax underwriting  those
lenders are now paying the price but we must be very careful not to act or appear to act in a way
that supports bad bets or lax underwriting standards without more widespread evidence of systemic
problems affecting the real economy
let me now turn to what i think is a more fundamental factor for gauging the strength of the
economy going forward and therefore the appropriate stance for monetary policy  in the most
recent greenbook the board staff revised down the rate of growth of structural productivity more or
less in line with the reduction in real gdp growth as we have been discussing  it is certainly
reasonable to think that this new information about the pace of real gdp growth during the past
three years contains information about the rate of growth of structural productivity going forward
but that is not an infallible signal  in my thinking about how monetary policy needs to be set
distinguishing temporary decreases in the rate of growth of productivity from permanent decreases
is a critical piece of the puzzle  a transitory decrease would not affect the steadystate equilibrium
real rate to my mind  but a permanent decrease would imply a lower steadystate equilibrium real
rate and thus a lower natural rate for the federal funds rate  if the equilibrium real rate is lower
holding the fed funds rate constant of course would imply an implicit tightening of monetary
policy
i am still grappling with the implications of these benchmark revisions for future
productivity growth  at this point in my forecast im assuming that the revisions imply a
rebenchmarking of the growth rate of structural productivity but that rebenchmarking or that
lowering of the trend rate of growth of real gdp is not enough so that core inflation can decelerate
toward price stability in the next two or three years or so under a constant fed funds rate  but the
reduction in the growth rate of structural productivity does feed through to a somewhat looser
required path of the fed funds rate through 2008 to 2009  in my forecast appropriate policy has the
fed funds rate rising to 5 percent in the first quarter of 08 holding steady there for two or three
quarters and then gradually drifting down toward a more neutral rate consistent with lower inflation
expectations and lower trend output growth  with this path of the fed funds rate i expect the
economy to return to near potential real gdp growth in the first or the second quarter of 2008  i
expect the housing correction to continue through the first half of 2008 but the drag lessens over the
year  i expect the core inflation rate to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year than in the
first half but i expect the economy by 2009 to grow near its potential growth rate which i now
assume to be 28 percent about 02 percent lower than i had last time with the unemployment rate
close to its natural rate of 5 percent and core inflation at about 15 percent
i have two other brief comments id like to make about our forecasting exercise and some
information i think is relevant  we continue to focus on the pce price index and i have some
objections to that  i continue to believe that the cpi is a better measure if for no other reasons than
that it is more familiar to the public and that it is not revised  we were lucky this time in the gdp
revisions that the pce price index was not revised very much and i think we run the risk that
focusing too heavily on a measure that does get revised can cause us some difficulty  i also have
some concern about the empirical ability of core pce to actually be a very good predictor of
headline pce inflation at the end of the day  so i am still struggling with our choice of the index
there  the other item that i would like to emphasizeand it was driven home to me in a meeting
with some reporters in the nottoodistant pastis that i do believe that moving toward measures of
uncertainty that include some fan charts would be useful  i was hesitant at first about that in part
because getting appropriate measures of uncertainty that are internally consistent across all our
forecasts and all our models would be very difficult  yet some what i would view as very
sophisticated journalists continue to confuse the issue of the range of our forecasts and our central
tendencies with the issue of uncertainty or certainty  they do not understand that our central
tendency is an agreement about what our point forecast is but that it may reveal very little or nothing
about the degree of uncertainty in our forecasts  so i think it is very important that we quantify that
in some way to be clearer and to eliminate some of that confusion  ill stop there  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  im sorry  i see a twohanded intervention
mr mishkin  charlie could i ask you about the issue of the fan charts  as i understood
the proposal the fan charts would be in there but we would not be producing our individual fan
charts
mr plosser   right
mr mishkin  so i think you are absolutely right  i strongly agree with you that it is
important to have something that is visually dynamic to get across uncertainty for many many
reasons particularly to get people to understand that even when we dont get it exactly right we
may still actually be doing a very good job and then of course to evaluate us in a more reasonable
way
mr plosser  well i am encouraged that that is going to be the case
mr mishkin  but i think it is a question of nuance  one of the issues that i wonder
about here is that for us to do a communal fan chart would be extremely difficult technically  so the
question is how we get across the issue of uncertainty in a very graphic way and i think it can be
done by producing information along the lines that the proposal mentioned  but i think we will
need to see examples  so i would recommend that the subcommittee or whoever will be involved
with the staff give us some different ways of doing it so that we can actually get some polling
information on people as to whether or not this is effective
mr plosser  that is fine  this point was driven home to me by somebody who i
thought was fairly sophisticated  he saw the central tendency narrow and thought that therefore we
were more certain about what our forecasts were
mr mishkin  it is not just the media  think about the financial analysts who are writing
about this all the timeand they get paid a lot more than we do
chairman bernanke  the two things are not completely unrelated
mr plosser  no they are not
chairman bernanke  if there is a lot of uncertainty then there will be more
divergence of views as well
mr plosser  they could be negatively correlated actually  just because our point
forecasts converge does not mean that our uncertainty about that forecast is decreased
chairman bernanke  no that is true
mr plosser  it just means that there is more agreement
chairman bernanke  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  my basic view of appropriate policy is little
changed from the previous meeting  none of the intermeeting developments yet compel me to
change my view that our focus should remain on reducing inflation and inflation expectations  the
outlook for gdp growth remains acceptable especially in view of the recent downward revisions in
the data and the associated lowering of estimates of growth potential  our baseline outlook is
consistent with that of recent months but the new concern is obviously the financial markets that
clearly are skittish about spillovers from the subprime market and about contagion in credit markets
spreading beyond structured products
evidence within the sixth district is consistent with this basically stable and positive
outlook  florida is seeing some notable spillovers from their problems in real estate but some of
these problems are idiosyncratic to the statefor example the widespread inability to get wind and
storm insurance  the rest of the district has not seen serious spillover into the broader economy
just like the greenbook we view the fundamentals of the economy to be stable  although the
residential real estate market may take some time to stabilize the problem seems generally
contained  our model suggests slightly stronger growth than the baseline greenbook throughout the
forecast period  our trend growth rate has not been reduced quite as much as the greenbooks and
our inflation forecast is not as favorable  at this juncture we are not ready to give much weight to
some of the more extreme alternate greenbook scenarios  we certainly recognize more uncertainty
and volatility than at the last meeting but were still expecting results essentially in line with the
baseline greenbook forecast
in the past few days i have had substantive conversations with some wellpositioned credit
market observers including managers of large investment portfolios suggesting that the skittishness
of financial markets is not likely to abate until later this fall  they have suggested that the
choppiness in financial markets will be the rule in the near term and very important that the
threshold for what constitutes a shock is now much lower than usual  i believe that the correct
policy posture is to let the markets work through the changes in risk appetite and pricing that are
under way but the market observations of one of my more strident conversational counterparts
and that is not jim cramer laughterare worth sharing  this party sees problems in the subprime
structured debt market spreading to the clo leveragedloan market and in a knockon effect to
repo and commercial paper markets as well as to investmentgrade corporate credit  this party
points to nonprice rationing commercial paper rollover risk and general cdo contagion caused by
the damaged credibility of rating agencies and contraction of collateral values  this party argues
that treating the widening of credit spreads as normalization ignores substantial subsurface potential
dislocations as evidenced by the collapse of american home mortgage corporation  all that said
another counterpart noted a large pool of money now on the sidelines that is ready to provide
financing for reasonable deals if prices fall low enough  importantly a large portion of this money
comes from reliable longterm sources of investment pension funds and insurance companies
notwithstanding some descriptive rhetoric this is not the credit crunch of the late 1980s when the
traditional financial intermediaries were strained for capital  the traditional investors are still out
there with substantial liquidity and they are just temporarily on the sidelines for understandable
reasons and barring further shocks should return to the markets in force later this fall  the
dislocations in the financial markets call for a posture of vigilant monitoring of developments but
nothing more for now
regarding the balance of risks it is early to materially adjust the weighting of gdp
downside versus inflation upside risks  but i have heightened concern as many of you do about
the continuing housing sector weakness combined with some potential of credit market turbulence
in time affecting business investment and consumer confidence and thereby the real economy
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  the boston staff forecast is broadly consistent with the greenbook
forecast with exportled growth being significantly offset by weakness in residential investment
resulting in a gradual increase in the unemployment rate and core pce inflation settling around 2
percent  the boston staff forecast is somewhat more optimistic on residential investment but also
has somewhat higher potential than the greenbook forecast  my own view is that residential
investment is likely to be as weak as in the greenbook forecast but that potential may be closer to
bostons estimate  taken together weak residential investment and somewhat stronger
productivity along with the possibility that construction employment will be more depressed going
forward may result in more of an upward drift in unemployment helping to reduce some of the
concerns with labor market pressures on inflation  however given the similarities in the forecasts
well within standard errors at this time it is probably more important to highlight the risks to the
forecast  it is notable that the rather benign outlook of the forecasters is in marked contrast to the
angst i hear when talking to asset and hedge fund managers in boston  the angst is new and
reflects heightened concerns with the financial ramifications stemming from subprime mortgages
recent developments in residential markets are of potential concern  they have been raised
by many around the table  over the past several years large homebuilders have been able to
increase their market share  given the use of subcontractors and with little obvious economies of
scale the primary advantage of large homebuilders would seem to be access to external finance
which allows them to purchase large tracts of land  when housing and land prices were rising
particularly in fast growing areas of the country this access provided a significant advantage over
the small builders that could not tie up significant resources in land  however what provided a
competitive advantage in the first half of this decade now places a significant strain on large
homebuilders  a large investment in land whose price is falling is aggravating the problem these
builders have with unsold inventory and depressed prices for new homes  not surprisingly the
largest homebuilders which account for nearly a quarter of homes sold have equity prices trading
lower than at any time in the past year and recent earnings announcements have highlighted
significant writedowns in land values  the low equity prices of homebuilders seem broadly
consistent with residential investment remaining quite weak well into 2008
financial market disruptions are likely to be a further impediment to the housing market and
potentially provide a channel for problems to extend beyond residential investment  a number of
financial instruments such as the 228 and 327 mortgages that were widely used last year are no
longer readily available  furthermore the originatetodistribute model has been disrupted by the
heightened uncertainty surrounding cdos and clos that we heard about earlier this morning
there seem to be two significant developments  first the liquidity of these instruments has
declined making valuation assessment difficult  as lenders have made margin calls forced
liquidation of collateral in illiquid markets has further depressed the market  while of concern i
would hope that this is only a shortrun effect  the second development of concern is that many
investors have been relying on rating agencies to evaluate credit risk but the underlying credit risk is
relatively opaque and the correlations between tranches may not have been fully appreciated  if
investors have lost confidence in the rating agencies to accurately assess credit risk for structured
products the market could be impeded until confidence is restored  since similar structures are
used for financial instruments besides mortgages getting secondary market financing for a broader
range of financing needs could be difficult and external financing for some borrowers could be
affected  this has been reflected in the widening spreads for riskier corporate bonds where the
spreads have widened from unusually low levels and are still relatively narrow compared with
earlier periods of significant financial disruption
while recent problems are not compelling enough for me to have a significant disagreement
with the forecast presented in the greenbook the risks surrounding that forecast on the downside
have increased  i remain concerned that higher oil prices a falling dollar and tight labor markets
pose upward risks to the forecast of inflation but recent events have significantly raised my estimate
of the risk of a slower economy than i would have predicted a few weeks ago
chairman bernanke  thank you  its now 1040  im informed the coffee is ready
why dont we break until 11 oclock
coffee break
chairman bernanke  lets reconvene  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  at the beginning of the break two of our leaders
made a special point of indicating that i was first up after the break  i guess that was an invitation to
be fast and quick  laughter  ill try
my overall impression from my business contacts is that things are more of the same rather
than anything very much different  i would note that the financial market upset is too recent to have
affected the plans of companies operating in the real economy  obviously financial firms are
scrambling  there seems to be something of a disconnect between my trucking industry contacts
and what i see in the industrial production numbers  the industrial production numbers suggest that
goods production is rising i dont know how theyre moving but they dont seem to be moving by
truck  one big overtheroad trucker says that loads are down 8 percent year over year  the
company has already cut trucking capacity 10 percent  he expects another cut of 4 percent by the
end of this year  hes trimming capital spending next year for trucks  obviously they see the
business as being pretty slack  incidentally nobody is talking about any particular labor market
pressures  another big company probably best known for the color of its brown trucks laughter
says that the industry overall is flat year over year  it believes that the outlook is somewhat more
optimistic than recent experience  the international business is booming  the asiapacific region
is shipping an awful lot of goods to both the united states and europe  my contact noted
something that i thought was sort of interesting  he said that there is some diversion from air
freight to water transporti guess because of the enormous cost difference but it suggests that
there may be a little easier inventory situation or something that is making that diversion make
sense  this company is very much in a costcutting mode because they have a big infrastructure
demand is relatively slack and they have a lot of cost built in and so the only thing they can do
when they cant build volume in the short run is to cut costs  that companys major competitor is
much more optimistic and has capital spending plans for fiscal 08 which ends in may of next year
up 20 percent from this year and sees a pretty strong business situation at least going forward
a contact in the restaurant industry says that restaurant prices are rising everywhere and
volumes are falling but overall business conditions are about the same  the restaurant industry has
been seeing that  a contact with a major software firm is pretty optimistic  pc sales are running at
or above expectation  my contact pointed out particularly that the quality of receivables has
actually improved  theyre not seeing any problem with collecting on the software that they sell
and 94 percent of the customers are current on making payments  even that is something of an
underestimate because a lot of purchasers initiate the payment at the end of a thirtyday due period
and so the payment doesnt come for another couple of days despite our brilliant electronic clearing
of payments
a comment about the housing industry  obviously the subprime issue is going to have a
relatively permanent effect  it is just changing the characteristic of this industry  underwriting was
too lax and that is changing  i think it is somewhat surprising that the builders have not scaled back
more quicklythat they continue to sit on such a large inventory  part of the reason is that once a
builder has started a development and has put all the infrastructure in placethe roads the sewers
the water and all of thatthe only way to get anything out of that investment is to complete the
subdivision  in addition a subdivision that stops is a bad signal for prospective buyers because they
dont want to move into something that is sitting there mostly idle  so i think the builders have an
intense interest in trying to complete these projects  but what that means of course is that as they
complete those projects they are not initiating a lot because theyre taking as richard pointed out
some pretty big price concessions in many cases and so they are probably not going to be initiating
as many projects in the future
my own bet is that the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally whats
going on in the real economy  first of all bank capital is not impaired  so unlike in some past
cases when losses on real estate impaired bank capital and thus affected the lending in areas that
had nothing to do with real estate i dont think thats the case this time  second the fact that some
lbo deals fall through isnt going to change what those companies are producing  the fact that the
ownership hasnt changed doesnt change the companys profitmaximizing level of production in
the short run  obviously that could change but it seems to me that the best information that we
now have is that this financial market upset is going to settle out and not have major repercussions
on the real economy putting the housing part aside  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  in the fifth district we continue to see
moderate economic growth though it has been uneven across sectors in recent weeks
manufacturing activity rebounded somewhat in june and july after several months of weakness
with our indexes showing increases in new orders and shipments  activity at district services firms
advanced at a steady pace with solid revenue growth and a broader pickup in hiring  the retail
sector however has lost much of the momentum reported last month as softness in bigticket
categories continues to constrain revenue growth  on the employment front district labor markets
are increasingly taut given steady hiring activity and slower labor force growth  in addition in
contrast to the eighth federal reserve district contacts continue to report rising wage pressures and
difficulty finding qualified workers  housing markets remain weak across much of the district
however commercial real estate activity remains healthy with steady demand reported for office
and industrial space  some contacts however have expressed concern about slower activity in the
retail segment of that market  turning to prices our july surveys indicate increased inflation
pressures  the average current rate of increase of manufacturers prices has moved up for both raw
materials and finished goods over the past few months reversing the decline seen earlier this year
price pressures on the services side have picked up as well though expectations for future prices
eased somewhat in the july report
at the national level we continued to receive fairly good news on inflation  after
annualized rates of monthly core pce inflation above 2 percent at the beginning of the year weve
now had four months of readings below 2  but there are still abundant reasons for caution as
president moskow for example noted  ill mention the greenbook which cites transitory
factorsapparel and owners equivalent rent for instancethat have contributed to the recent
moderation  the passing of these damping forces could well push core inflation back up in the near
term  so although i think we have reason to take some comfort from recent inflation numbers and i
do i want to wait to see more evidence especially as growth moves back toward trend
i still think the prospects for a return to trend growth are reasonably good and my
assessment of trend is still a bit higher than the greenbooks in part because ive not revised my
estimate of productivity growth much in response to the gdp revisions  obviously there are
downside risks to be concerned about and financial market activity since the last meeting obviously
raises some concerns  as far as we can tell at this point the heightened turbulence of the past
month is all pretty closely related to subprime and nontraditional mortgages and the leveraged
financing of private equity buyouts in the corporate sector  these two market segments are
relatively new and they represent the latest manifestation of the broad ongoing wave of financial
innovation that weve been seeing over the past few decades  because these two markets are so
young one would expect participants risk assessments to be more uncertain and thus be more
sensitive to what is learned from market events and incoming news  that said developments in the
past month have certainly been quite dramatic and it looks less like rapid learning than it does rapid
unlearning of what was previously viewed as knownalthough that too is of course a form of
learning
the implication of these revised risk assessments for the economic outlook and for policy
depend on whether they affect business investment or household spending on consumption or new
housing  at this point the answer to that question is not yet clear but its worth noting that by
many measures corporate credit quality seems to remain pretty good by historical standards and
the buyout movement as president poole just noted seems to have been more about restructuring
liabilities and governance arrangements and less about funding capital spending  so its not obvious
why there should be dramatic effects on business investment  what about consumption  pce was
fairly soft last quarter and this softness could be a harbinger of moresustained weakness  the
secondquarter softness may well be a onetime phenomenon however reflecting both the sharp
rise in gasoline prices in the first five months of the year and some payback from the strong
spending growth in q4 and q1  moreover the outlook for household income looks pretty good
with labor market conditions fairly firm and consumption gains showing no sign of slowing down
in addition household net worth is coming off a relatively high base  neither of these fundamentals
seems likely to be seriously threatened by the repricing thats in train
housing on the other hand continues to be the predominant area of concern regarding real
spending and financial market developments have only heightened that concern  the greenbook
paints a fairly pessimistic picture  the decline in residential investment accelerates over the
remainder of year and continues into next and the inclusion of three greater housing correction
alternative scenarios suggests that the staff is especially concerned justifiably so in my view with
the downside risk to their outlook  but even though the housing market has definitely deteriorated
the outlook for housing is quite uncertain in my mind and i continue to think that a more moderate
decline is also possible and that housing could be somewhat less of a drag on growth than the
greenbook forecasts  at this point however the reassessment under way in secondary markets
regarding housingrelated credits still has a way to go and until that process plays out its going to
be hard to gauge the resulting magnitude of repricing at the retail level  about all i conclude at this
point is that the outlook for housing is still awfully uncertain right now  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  the balance of risks has
changed since our last meetingsignificantly in my view  overall spending by households and
businesses is weaker  housing of course is significantly worse and the underlying pace of
productivity growth and potential growth seems lower  in addition financial market developments
have deteriorated with a very broad based increase in risk premiums decline in some asset prices
pockets of liquidity pressures and some disruption in mortgage markets and highyield corporate
credit markets  these developments in financial markets even though they represent a necessary
adjustment a generally healthy development have the potential to cause substantial damage
through the effects on asset prices market liquidity and credit through the potential failure of
moreconsequential financial institutions and through a general erosion of confidence among
businesses and households  if this situation were to materialize and these effects were to persist
they could have significant effects on the strength of aggregate demand going forward  the process
now under way in financial markets could take some time to resolve and finding a new balance
could take a while
we have modified our forecast in ways similar to the changes to the greenbook  we have a
slightly weaker second half of 07 and a slightly lower estimate of growth in 08 and 09 reflecting
a downwardly revised estimate of potential growth  our growth numbers for 07 08 and 09 look
roughly like 2 rising to 2 percent  our inflation forecast is essentially unchanged with core
pce inflation moderating to slightly under 2 percent over the forecast period  our differences with
the greenbook are not trivial but they seem well within the somewhat greater uncertainty we now
face about the outlook for growth  the negative skew in our view of the risks to the outlook
suggests a somewhat downward slope to the path of the fed funds rate going forward to the
appropriate stance of monetary policy rather than the flat path assumed by the greenbook  so even
if financial market conditions stabilize and credit markets particularly the mortgage markets find
equilibrium relatively soon and start to open up again the growth risks have shifted a bit more to the
downside around the lower expected path  in contrast if the disruption in credit markets persists
and liquidity markets are further impaired then we face the prospect of a significantly weaker path
to aggregate demand
inflation risks in our view however remain slightly tilted to the upside but these types of
risk are very different  the inflation risks are modest and manageable  we characterize them as
skewed to the upside in part because of the differences across the committee as to our desired
individual longrun views about the inflation level in part because of our differences as to whats an
acceptable period for bringing core inflation down to that objective and in part because of different
views about the structure of inflation dynamics in this economy  the risks to markets and
ultimately to growth are very different  theres a much longer negative tail in terms of the range of
potential outcomes and those risks are going to be harder for us to manage partly because they
depend on confidence  because of these differences i think its hard to counterpoise these two risks
against each other and assess the balance between them  of course as always we should weigh
each by their probability their effects and our capacity to manage those effects  i think that the
probability of a bad inflation outcome has diminished from what we would have said two quarters
ago and the probability of an adverse growth outcome has increased  as i said the latter risk is
interesting and complicated in part because it might be harder to manage
i want to make two points in this regard  first a number of you have said that we want to
see more evidence of adverse effects on aggregate demand before we change our view about the
appropriate path of monetary policy  i dont really think thats the right way to think about this  if
we took that approach wed inevitably be too late  just as we think about inflation risks by looking
forward and looking at expectations we need to be forward looking and thinking about the potential
implications of these dynamics of financial markets on the growth outlook  the information we
have now about whats happening in markets and about the implications for credit markets and
ultimately for confidence and demand is very stale and uneven  my second observation about this
challenge is that what makes it hard is partly that you are seeing a combination of things  you are
seeing a loss of confidence in the capacity of investors to assess underlying risk in mortgage
markets in part because of uncertainty about what housing prices are going to do and in part because
of uncertainty about correlations in losses across households  you are also seeing a collapse in
confidence as bill described it in how to value complex structured credit products probably from
the loss of faith in ratings and from the changes ahead in ratings methodology and in actual ratings
youre also seeing the difficulties that investors and counterparties now have in evaluating the risk
in exposure to financial counterparties and youre seeing in some ways reflecting all of this a
diminished willingness to finance whats relatively high quality paper  we live in a system in
which risk has been transferred much more broadly but a lot of that risk has gone to leveraged
funds that have much less capacity to absorb this kind of shock without facing a lot of liquidity
pressures  the combination of these things means that youre seeing some impairment in the
natural dynamic by which when prices adjust you have new people coming in willing to buy at
those low prices  but these challenges in information and in diagnosing whats happening in
markets mean that the process is not working as quickly as you might have thought in mortgages
and in highyield corporate credit  you can see this sort of skew in the risks reflected i think
sensibly in the change of market expectations about the fed funds rate  you can see this balance in
the distribution that bill described where you see a sharply negative skew in expectations about the
path on the downside and you see that come also in the context of relative stability of inflation
expectations  that shift of mean expectations in the distribution does not come with any sense that
the consequence might be some erosion in confidence about our capacity to keep inflation
expectations down
now in terms of policy i personally wouldnt want to lean against the change in market
expectations that weve seen so far even though it has moved a long way in a short time  its really
important to give ourselves more flexibility than we now have to respond to what could be a rapidly
deteriorating overall environment thats just pragmatically essential given that the range of
foreseeable monetary policy actions were likely to confront has broadened very substantially
relative to where we were a quarter ago  the challenge of course is to figure out a way to
acknowledge and to show some awareness of these changes in market dynamics without feeding the
concern without overreacting about underlying strength in the fundamentals of the economy as a
whole or in the financial system  that is a difficult balance but i think it requires some softening of
the asymmetry in our assessment of the balance of risks now
an advertisement in response to a bunch of points made so far including by president
fisherthe morning call that bill dudleys staff runs from new york is a very good fairly
textured prism of whats happening across these markets  they do a good job of trying to integrate
a bunch of the anecdotes and the facts and its the most efficient device any of us have to check in
about that evolving balance  it wont satisfy everybodys demand to have as much information as is
out there but its a fairly efficient way to get a pretty good picture and so i commend that to you
its a really good thoughtful and reasonably deep collection of wisdom in the markets today
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  building on what the vice chairman just said i
have been listening in on that morning call  ive found it very useful and its certainly an
opportunity to ask questions if you have them
my forecast for the most likely outcome for output over the next few years is close to that of
the staffgrowth a little below potential for a few quarters held down by the housing correction
and the unemployment rate rising a little further  although some recent data for housing
consumption and capital spending have been a bit to the soft side we need to view those data
against the background of a lower path for potential gdp and recall the tendency weve seen over
the past several quarters for short runs of data that are a little hotter or a little cooler than we
expected  i think this is sort of what it feels like when the economy is running at about 2 percent
i see a number of reasons to think that moderate growth remains the most likely outcome
going forward  first as president stern has stressed from time to time is the natural resilience of
the economy its tendency to grow near potential unless something is pushing it one way or another
if anything this resilience has probably increased over the past couple of decades reflecting more
flexible labor and product markets  second global growth remains strong supporting the growth of
exports  i dont think this growth should be undermined by the fact that some unknown quantity of
losses in the us mortgage market is being absorbed by investors overseas and the recent declines
in the dollar will reinforce the effects of good foreign demand for us goods and services  third
the most likely factor to throw the economy off its potential is the financial markets  my most
likely forecast assumed that the credit markets would begin to settle down over coming weeks with
some but limited net tightening of conditions  ill return to the subject in a bit but my outlook in
this regard does rest fundamentally on the very strong financial condition of the nonfinancial
business sector and commercial banks and my expectation that most households accounting for the
vast bulk of consumer spending will not find credit availability newly constrained  finally a
resumption of growth in consumption should be supported by moderate growth in jobs and
household income as the rebound in productivity is limited by the slower path for trend productivity
and as income shares shift a little toward labor  i also assumed that households would not face a
repeat of the rise in gasoline prices that has taken something out of recent consumption demand
then moderate growth in consumption along with good export markets should in turn support
business investment spending  i expect this path for output to be associated with core inflation
remaining in the neighborhood of 2 percent  if energy prices follow the path in futures markets
total inflation would come down to 2 percent as well
basically i dont see anything in my central tendency forecast for the economy that would
push inflation very much one way or another  the economy produces around its longrun potential
my nairu was 4 percent  inflation expectations as best we can judge are anchored at something
like 2 percent pce inflation  im encouraged that the most recent data on prices have tended to
confirm that core inflation remains fairly low  most measures of compensation also do not show a
marked acceleration that might be associated with producing appreciably beyond the economys
sustainable level of production  risks around my inflation forecast remain to the upside provided
that output follows my most likely path  utilization is tight  the recent runup in energy prices
could still feed through to expectations  the damped increase in productivity growth implies
greater pressure on business costs and margins  historically nominal wages have tended to respond
more sluggishly to changes in trend productivity than do prices and this could be especially the
circumstance when workers have seen real incomes held down by higher energy prices and business
profit margins have been high
at the same time like many around this table i think that the downside risks around the
forecast of moderate growth and production going forward have increased  for some time i thought
that the risk of a shortfall from our central tendency outweighed the risk of an overshoot mainly
centered on housing and consumption  but the financial developments of the last intermeeting
period have appreciably increased those risks  as many have remarked and bill said so nicely
problems have spread from the subprime sector to a good part of the mortgage market more
generally including a severe restriction on securitization of nonconforming mortgages  some
business credit has been affected  spread are widening across a broad array of instruments and
ratings  this has occurred in an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility and uncertainty partly
related to the questions about the pricing of complex structured credits that werent well understood
and compounded by a loss of confidence in the rating agencies  the uncertainty is also a reflection
of the perception that activity and prices in the housing market have not yet shown any signs of
beginning to stabilize  i agree that we need to keep our focus on the effects of these developments
and the financial markets on the economy not on the distribution of wealth in the financial sector
the relationship of financial markets to real activity is multifaceted not easily modeled with interest
rates and stock prices especially when markets are reconsidering risk  tightening nonprice terms
of lending the reduced availability of credit and simply the pervasive sense of uncertainty about the
price of assets and cash flows can also affect spending  in such an environment it wouldnt be
surprising if businesses and households postponed capital investments
i agree that this reassessment is a fundamentally healthy but somewhat messy correction to
moresustainable term and risk premiums  the most likely outcome is that it will be limited in
duration and effect and thats what i assume for my forecast  wellcapitalized banks and
opportunistic investors will come in and fill the gap restoring credit flows to nonfinancial
businesses and to the vast majority of households that can service their debts  in the end credit
conditions will be tighter than they were a little while ago for the most part justifiably so and the
effect on output will probably not be very large  to be sure the latest episode comes on top of a
rise in term premiums over the may to june intermeeting period  as a consequence financial
conditions have tightened noticeably in the past few months even abstracting from market
disruptions of the last week
the federal funds rate has been as high as it has been in part to offset the accommodative
effects of low volatility and tight term and credit premiums  i think that even in the relatively
benign adjustment scenario well need to look at whether that rate is still sufficiently supportive of
economic activity  but in the circumstancesthat is the benign adjustmentthat reassessment can
await further information about aggregate demand and further assurance that inflation will remain
low  i assumed an easing of policy in 2008 and 2009 in my projections to take account of this  but
we cant know how the market situation will evolve  i also believe that theres a nonnegligible
chance of a prolonged and very messy adjustment period that would feed back substantially on
confidence wealth and spending  with the rating agencies discredited and markets vulnerable to
adverse news on the economy the period of unusual uncertainty could be prolonged  the greatest
risk is in the household sector where uncertainty about valuations of mortgages could continue to
feed back on credit availability housing demand and prices in a selfreinforcing cycle  moreover
as lenders and borrowers revise assumptions about house prices even further credit from home
equity lines of credit and mortgage refinancings will become even less available and more
expensive putting to the test the hypothesis that i have been working underthat the feedback from
housing on consumption can be approximated by a wealth effect not something more serious
working through housing equity withdrawal  as i noted i dont think this is the most likely
outcome but this tail of distribution is a lot fatter than it was only a month or so ago  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  as many of us have discussed around this
table and many of you already mentioned today it has finally happened  per earlier discussions
the muchanticipated repricing of risk is upon us and i think what we all have quickly
recognized then and now is that the diagnosis was the easy part  more difficult is to figure
when the symptoms would manifest themselves harder still is to understand the second and
thirdorder consequences and perhaps most difficult is to determine whether any treatment is
needed or whether as the hippocratic oath suggests the patient will recover on its own  even
orderly repricings have fat tails as governor kohn mentioned and what we find in the
marketplace is complacency replaced very quickly by deep concern  certainly this recent
market turmoil looks particularly pronounced in contrast to previous periods when trees appeared
to grow to the sky and markets were priced for perfection in a world that seemed to most of us to
be decidedly imperfect  let me discuss two distinct mattersfirst the state of the financial
markets building on the presentation from bill tim and others and then the harder part the
impact on the broader economybefore trying to summarize the situation
the financial markets have really provided wind at the back of the broader economy
throughout this most recent period even until a month ago  i think the open question and the
hardest is whether those financial markets will prove sufficiently resilientthat is whether the
underlying shocks to the economy that might occur are exacerbated by this financial market
situation or whether the worst of the outcomes are made less severe by the financial markets
perhaps it is best to review the dynamics of different asset markets to assess their implications
for credit availability during the forecast period  the threat is that these different asset classes
increasingly look correlated particularly in times of distress  certainly the events of recent
weeks culminating in trading late thursday and friday of last week are troubling driven by a
combination of factors  first symbolized perhaps by one financial institution that has
unwittingly called its own liquidity into some question second a function of a reduction in
confidence in markets themselvesa pullback in liquiditywith considerably less trust in
underlying valuations underlying collateral and the underlying structure of markets themselves
and third an expectation at least in the mortgage markets that there is still another leg down and
so one way bets at least for a period appear insufficient to bring other opportunistic capital in at
this point  the pullback was manifested in the difficulty of rolling over extendable commercial
paper as bill and others have said a lack of bid for anything mortgage related a lack of trust in
credit ratings and a fear of using financial institutions as counterparties  the next period in my
judgment holds out some promise but not a guarantee of opportunistic capital  certainly there
are big fund raisings by investment banks and other private pools of capital at remarkable
leverage levels giving the potential that the pools of liquidity that are on the sidelines could
quickly find their way back into the game
let me now turn to different asset markets to try to assess when we will know how they
will figure themselves out and make sure that we are able to get some judgments before it is too
late  so i will spend a moment on the bank and leveragedloan markets a couple of moments on
the subprime market and another moment on a third bucket of assets which might be everything
else as we are trying to figure out whether there is real spreading  first in the bank and
leveragedloan market the volume of loans as many of you know is somewhere between
220 billion and 320 billion of committed capital in the pipeline  the underlying credits still
appear quite strong and i will tell you that i have a reasonably high degree of confidence that in
spite of the distress these markets should work themselves out between now and the next fomc
meeting  we certainly wont see any return to the markets that people have gotten used to over
the past several months and years but i would be surprised if we didnt see opportunistic capital
coming into these markets and bidding prices  just to give you some idea off that denominator
of capital committed we might see losses on the order of 30 billion or 50 billion  i would say
thats a fairly conservative estimate  bank debt which is the most secured might have discounts
of 3 to 5 percent should bids find their way into the market in the coming days leveraged loans
and high yields discounts of about 10 percent and second lien mortgages discounts of 15 to
20 percent  almost all of these are largely related to risk premiums not credit quality  real
money is still in these businesses  some of the hot money that was discussed earlier some of
these clo buyers are no doubt gone for some time  i think the most encouraging thing is the
new funds that have begun capitalraising campaigns even over the past weekend looking to
buy the distressed securities marketforce the commercial institutions that have been having it
on their books and mark it to market  remarkably many of the same commercial banks are
prepared to stand behind these new leveraged investments with leverage of about 4 to 1  so i
would expect that market to increase pretty quickly  market functioning there is thus in my
judgment likely to improve  some deals are certainly likely to blow up relieving some of these
banks of their commitments  but in this market because there are multiple gatekeepers and
because valuing the underlying credit strikes me as not that timeintensive or taxing a process it
is likely in my judgment that come fall we will come to some new equilibrium
i can be far less confident however about the subprime mortgage market  my base case
assessment there has a much lower confidence level both in terms of timing and in terms of
outcome  the subprime market has about 14 trillion in outstandings and there is considerably
less certainty about the underlying credit  it is harder to measure and appraise the underlying
pools  recovery rates will be still harder to find  as a final note which might have struck the
markets last week apparently more fraud is endemic to these pools making valuation
increasingly difficult  as a result i am less comfortable about suggesting what the underlying
losses might be  they might be 100 billion  they could be considerably more  im also less
confident that there will be opportunistic capital coming back to these markets over the next
thirty or sixty days  with another leg down it could take considerably longer  as a result i am
quite a bit less confident that the market functioning will return as rapidly as we would hope  i
am more concerned that unlike the multiple gatekeepers we find in the leveragedloan markets
for those that relied on the single gatekeepers the creditrating agencies given that their
credibility has been shot it is much harder to see that this market will unwind itself in a rather
calm and comforting environment at least over the balance of 2007
the final set of asset markets id speak a moment about is everything else  what about
everything else that is subject to structured products  what about everything else that is subject
to complex financial instruments  some questions arose late last week about the market
integrity regarding those  i think it is just too hard to judge how that is going to work out  we
are seeing losses showing up in some very unlikely places  id like to say that what we have
witnessed over the past week is transitory but for that set of asset markets it is probably hardest
for me to come to a broader judgment
so what are the effects then on the broader economy  i agree with the point that
president stern made earlier that this judgment is extremely hard to make  i also agree with
governor kohns judgment that there is a very real downside risk if some of these financial
market turmoil issues persist  if i look at some of the credit channels and at financial
intermediaries and ask whether they are under stress i see more dispersion of risk among
similarly situated institutions  some commercial banks may well be under more distress than
others  i have no doubt that some investment banks are under more distress than others  we see
some of this dispersion in credit default swaps and some of it in equity prices but my sense is
that the underlying fundamentals of their core businesses are very different from each other and
from their competitors than theyve been at any point in this cycle  for some of them to take
losses on their own balance sheets of 3 billion 4 billion or 5 billion as an investment bank
might not be hard to do when many of them have been picking up market share and using their
own proprietary trading and agency businesses to steal customers and revenue from others  but
for the balance i think it is unclear how it is going to result  with many of the investment
banks quarters ending in august the markets are going to put genuine pressure on them to come
clean with their losses  i expect most if not all of them to do so  so i think come mid
september well have a clearer sense of what their own markedtomarket models suggest  what
about the brokerdealers  again not principally their regulators but i suspect the markets are
going to push them to come clean with what their losses are  large financial institutions i would
expect though with less confidence to take writedowns of their portfolios of leveraged loans and
writedowns to some extent of their mortgage products to try to assure the investing community
of their financial positions  i hope that the process would work out this fall but as i mentioned
im less comfortable that were going to get that kind of transparency with the regulated
commercial banks than with some others
private pools of capital are also undergoing a real shakeout  for those with liquidity
pressures which will tend not to be the largest hedge funds or private equity funds we will read
about their problems and we will read about their closings over the coming weeks and months
the good news is that the largest among them have used the period of strong liquidity over the
past year to more or less have quasipermanent capital to term out their loans and provide capital
so that they could take advantage in this period  i understand that there has been very little spike
in margin calls where most of the assets rest in the hedge fund community  so for many of us
who have talked about hedge funds bringing resilience to these markets this is really a time of
testing  i think the early news for the largest among them is quite positive
many of you have talked about what the other transmission mechanisms are for having
gdp effects  the wealth effect is real  we have lost about 1 trillion in market capital in the
past twenty trading days and that cant be discounted  questions about board room confidence
and capex in the second half of this year are equally real  my sense is that we are going to
finally use that excess cash on balance sheets that many of us have long talked about  finally
with respect to consumer confidence though i think the recent data suggest that its positive i
suspect that the next set of data we get will show a retreat from those numbers  it is very hard to
judge how real consumers are going to react here
let me make two final comments  opportunistic capital is a key here to a smooth
transition  its key to ensuring that what happened in the financial markets doesnt seep its way
into the real economy  of the equity investors that were using loose credit markets to get equity
returns the most sophisticated are focusing on and looking for equity returns in the debt markets
so many investors previously investing in equity are now looking to the debt markets where
they see a riskreward tradeoff that is better than it has been in a long time  that gives me some
confidence that opportunistic capital will come back to some of these markets  that said rating
sensitive buyers will no doubt pull back given that ratings are less authoritative  so i will end
where i began which is looking at economic fundamentals  i think governor kohn talked about
how the capital markets the financial markets and the labor markets have proven to be
absolutely core to the resilience of the broader economy  to the extent that there is now an
unfortunate timing between weakness in the financial markets and some potential weakness in
underlying credit we can rely less on the financial markets to come to the rescue should that
circumstance occur  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i was looking back at my notes of the past
few meetings and noted that the position we are in is a bit like that in the may meeting at least
the way in which people are characterizing thingsthat economic fundamentals still suggest
moderate growth for the intermediate term but that uncertainty has gone up dramatically  then
in the june meeting we said that uncertainty went down and now were saying that uncertainty
has gone up again  so we seem to have a little volatility just like the markets do but obviously
we are responding to what the markets are doing  clearly there are key downside risks  the
risk that ive mentioned many times before that concerns me and that we now have more data on
is productivity and potential growth  with the revisions since 03 the compounded growth rate
of productivity is down to 14 percent from 18 percent  the revision is fairly significant over
this period  i am not ready to go quite as far as the greenbook has gone in marking down
potential but i do think that it is a real possibility and it is very closely linked to my concerns
about investment which obviously the financial market volatility has affected
orders and shipments of durable goods have been a bit choppy and we havent seen the
kind of rise that we would expect given the balance sheets and given all the other sorts of
strength that we would otherwise see in the economy  nonresidential investment has been
strong and there is still some strength in mining and drilling but i have a lot of concerns outside
that area  as a number of people have mentioned there is little change in the actual cost of
capital even though spreads have risen because the treasuries have gone down  but with more
uncertainty and more volatility as governor warsh and others have mentioned undoubtedly that
is going to weigh heavily in the board room  it is going to weigh heavily on capital expenditure
plans  so all other things being equal businesses are likely to be a bit more cautious going
forward  but that caution with respect to investment and the slowing of the investment recovery
make it harder to be optimistic about a rebound in productivity growth  so thats something that
i watch very closely because i think it is a very very important effect
on the consumptionsaving balance certainly we still have very robust labor markets
average growth of 120000 privatesector jobs per month this year which is a step down from
last year but still a robust level  we have a transition from a sort of cushion of the strong equity
market offsetting the negative wealth effect in the housing market  now if they become more
correlatedand in particular more correlated and both go downthat obviously would raise
some concerns about slowing consumption growth and increasing saving  so i think that is
something to be very mindful of
with respect to housing and financial markets in the senior loan officer survey with
respect to mortgages when you drill down into it both in april and in july more than 50 percent
of the senior loan officers reported that they are tightening credit standards for subprime and
about 15 percent are for prime  that is fairly significant  the depository institutions are pulling
back and we have certainly heard reports that some of the large institutions are no longer
offering 228s or 327s  there has also been a tightening outside the depository institutions  the
reason for part of the tightening is that some of the mortgage providers are simply no longer
there  we have had dozens of smaller providers of credit go out of business and the ones that
are still there are obviously changing their underwriting standards  as president rosengren
mentioned we are seeing some questions about the originatetodistribute model  we are also
seeing volatility on the financial market side  but part of that volatility as a number of people
have expressed is about concerns about what is going into those securities in the originateto
distribute model  that may raise some questions in the long run about how much were going to
see this market come back  i share governor warshs concerns not only from the point of view
of the financial markets but also regarding the structure of mortgage marketsthat we may be
seeing a little less of that kind of structure than we have seen in the past  so that combined with
the tightening of standards more broadly may make financing more difficult to get  this of
course is occurring in many parts of the countrynot all parts but many partswhere housing
inventories are very high and in some cases are still rising  obviously that puts a lot more
pressure on the housing market and i think the drag from the housing market as many of you
said is likely to continue
fortunately the financial market volatility is coming at a time of relative strength in
corporate balance sheets  debttoasset ratios have been declining and liquid assets as a
percentage of total assets have been high  that provides much more of a cushion much more
insurance  as president poole mentioned the banking system is in a dramatically different state
from when we had challenges before in the housing market or major challenges in financial
markets  the major banks have very high relative to historical trends capitaltoasset ratios in
excess of the required minimums  they have been very very profitable  if you look at the
largest banksand i was just looking at some that were most involved in the leveragedloan
marketthey each have tier 1 capital on the order of 80 billion to 90 billion  the earnings for
each over the last year are 25 billion to 35 billion  there is also a lot of discussion of the
amount of highly leveraged loans in the pipelineon the order of 300 billion  but unless they
have to take losses on that 300 billion which is not going to happen they have very thick
capital cushions and very high earnings  so at least for the foreseeable future this will just be
more a challenge to their earnings than a challenge to capital
that is extremely important because the banking system can provide a critical automatic
stabilizing mechanism as it did in 1998 when there are liquidity challenges  in 1998 we had the
asian crisis that spread to latin america then the russian crisis and ltcm  there were some
parallels to what we are seeing now  risk spreads were rising very dramatically after a period of
nearrecord low levels and we saw the yields on treasuries go down quite a bit because thats
where people were going  but what was happening in the system was that people were pulling
money out of various funds and instruments and putting it into the banking system  so the banks
do act as liquidity providers and liquidity insurers and i think were starting to see a bit of that
now with people pulling out of some of these instruments and so more is flowing into the banks
its a little early to tell  we havent gotten enough data on that  but anecdotal reports are
consistent with exactly what happened in 1998  as people need an alternative to commercial
paper or other shortterm sources of credit it can be very helpful that the banking system will
have more liquid resources to do that and obviously its a strong capital environment  also as
governor warsh mentioned there are more large private pools of capital to step in to bid for the
ltcms if such things happen  when we look back to ltcm only one offer was on the table
from warren buffettand there were a lot of questions about how serious that offer would be
now a number of players have the wherewithal to be the equivalent of that in this market which
has the potential to be quite helpful  there are obviously more potential downside risks but a lot
of stability exists in the banking system to deal with some of these risks and given the strength
of the balance sheets should be helpful in the short or the intermediate run
with respect to inflation as many people have mentioned a number of risks are still
skewed to the upside with robust global growth potential passthrough some previous high
energy prices and a lower dollar  so i still think that there is much more of a potential upside
skew to inflation than a downside skew  basically i would start taking my first steps but just
very first steps a little more toward a balance of risk because of the greater downside to growth
although there are still upside risks to inflation as vice chairman geithner mentioned overall
we might want to think of moving a little more toward a greater balance of risk but still with a
predominant concern for inflation
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you  well except for the fact that we have had a benchmarking
of potential gdp downward and greater weakness in housing my forecast is basically similar to
my forecast at the last fomc meeting and is consistent with the greenbook forecastthat we
would have a return to trend growth a bit later than we had expected but by mid2008 and 2009
in regard to the issue of inflation let me just provide a little information on the model that im
thinking about  you know that i think a key driver of inflation of course is inflation
expectations and that there are good arguments to say that they are grounded around 2 percent
we have been seeing numbers continually coming in that are very consistent with that which
gives me more and more confidence that in fact inflation is gravitating strongly to this 2 percent
level
but i want to talk a bit about the issue of output gaps because i think that it is important
even if you think that inflation expectations are extremely important not to have a deus ex
machina view of the inflation process which is that inflation is caused by expected inflation and
then where does that come from  so i think that resource utilization is important  however the
problem is that what is really important is not just current resource utilization which is what we
tend to put in our econometric specifications but also the future expected path of resource
utilization and output gaps  of course one problem here is that it is hard to measure  also if
you are doing monetary policy right then there is an expectation that you are going to do the
right things to eliminate those output gaps  in fact that is exactly what is in our forecast and
exactly what our policies have been doing  so one reason i think in the current juncture that it
is not critical to talk about output gaps a whole lot is that basically we are doing the right thing
that context gives me further reason for saying given our forecast that a 2 percent inflation
number is where we are heading just not now and that the trend is solidly in place  but we are
going to stay there for the foreseeable future unless we screw up somehow and we are not going
to do that  laughter
one key point that makes me a little different from the committee on inflation is that i do
not see the upside risks as being greater than the downside risks  i really do see the risks as
being quite balanced on inflationagain around this 2 percent number  yes we do have some
temporarily good news and it is going to be unraveled a bit but it is still consistent with the
2 percent overall trend  in terms of output gaps and future expectations i dont see those getting
people thinking that were going to have too tight resource utilization
let me turn to the issue of the financial markets because obviously that is the big gorilla
sitting at the table  i dont see what is happening now as a direct spillover from the subprime
market  it is very consistent with the way that bill was talking about this issue  of course the
media are making the subprime market into the whole story but i think it is just not the right
story  the subprime market is really a very small percentage of the total credit markets  what i
think is much more important is that people are questioning and reassessing the quality of the
information that exists in financial markets  the point of the subprime market is just that we
now trust the creditrating agencies less  basically what i think is happening in a way is quite a
good thing  we were concerned that the markets were a little too optimistic that there was too
much opacity and that people werent worried about it  now in fact they are worried about it
and i think that is fundamentally a healthy situation  also the parts of the market that are having
the problem are the most opaque parts it is not clear that they are particularly important to the
things we really care about in terms of our policies which is what will happen to aggregate
demand and therefore to both inflation and output  so at this point i take the view that this
could all end very well and could in the long run make the situation healthier and this view is
consistent with what governor kohn was pointing out
but i do worry that this reassessment could actually find morewhats the right word
skeletons in the closet or bad things happening than were expected  in the past weve seen that
when the quality of information gets questioned and people dont think the marketplace is
providing the right information headwinds in the economy can become quite significant  the
most recent episode that i am thinking about of course is the episode of enron and its aftermath
in which a key reason that the economy was so slow to recover was that the quality of
information was impaired  then people realized that the markets in fact did have some slight
elements of financial instabilityagain not too serious because the banking system was in such
good shape  we could have a similar situation occurring now  so the sort of bad scenario that i
see is an enrontype scenario not something much worse than that  but we really have to keep
on top of this  it means i think that there are greater downside risks to the forecast  the survey
of all of us indicates that people are now much more worried about downside risks than they are
about upside risks  i think that is absolutely right and in fact it could get a lot worse  so the
way i would view the situation is that right now we should be pretty calm but we want to
monitor it very carefully and be ready for some potentially bad things to happen and just hope
that they dont  the kind of scenario that were seeing in the greenbook is one that is going to
play out  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank everyone  president lockhart
mr lockhart  i want to make a comment following the remarks of governor warsh
and governor kroszner related to the calendar of potential market stabilization and the
leveragedloan market  both of you cited a backlog of 300 billion or something maybe slightly
less than that  in one conversation i had a market observer cited 470 billion and argued that it
would take well beyond our september meeting into october and november before the market
would clear in that particular part of the market  so to connect this comment to governor
geithners comment about maintaining some flexibility as we go into the fall and observe the
markets we have different estimates out there of how much backlog there is and therefore we
are likely to be still facing a great deal of uncertainty at our september meeting
chairman bernanke  thank you for the useful discussion  as usual i am going
to very briefly summarize what i heard  i will be happy to take any comments on that  then i
just want to make a few short points  again most of the key points have been made
most participants expect growth to remain moderate over the forecast period  despite
lower household wealth resulting from weaker house and stock prices consumption is likely to
continue to grow as labor markets remain strong real incomes increase and gasoline prices
moderate  business investment should also grow moderately although lower productivity and
higher volatility could be drags on investment  commercial real estate in particular may be
slackening but it retains good fundamentals  the global economy is strong  industrial
production is expanding at a reasonable pace  however downside risks to growth were noted
and perhaps received somewhat greater emphasis than at past meetings  most notably housing
appears to have weakened further with sales of new and existing homes declining and
inventories of unsold homes remaining high  homebuilders are experiencing financial strains
and there is downward pressure on home prices  spillover on consumption spending is not yet
evident but is a possible risk
in this regard developments in credit markets received considerable attention  on the
positive side the repricing of risk and the reevaluation of underwriting standards seem
appropriate  liquidity still exists credit is still being extended and markets may work out their
problems on their own  a lower dollar and lower longterm treasury rates also tend to offset
financial tightening  however higher risk premiums tougher underwriting and greater
uncertainty may constrain housing and investment spending leading to broader macroeconomic
effects  in morepessimistic scenarios dislocations in credit markets may last awhile and have a
more substantial effect on credit availability and costs for businesses as well as for homebuyers
the possibility of contagion or severe financial instability also exists  many participants took
note of the nipa revisions and their implications for productivity growth consumer saving and
unit labor costs  meeting participants tend to put potential growth at higher rates than the
greenbook
views on inflation are similar to those in previous meetings  recent readings are viewed
as reasonably favorable  however risks to inflation remain including the possible reversal of
transitory factors tight labor markets the high price of commodities and higher unit labor costs
resulting from lower productivity growth  in all the risks to inflation remain to the upside  that
is my summary of what i heard  im sure a lot more could be said  any comments
if not let me just make a few additional comments  there have been two very important
developments since the last meeting  the first was the downward revision to the nipa growth
numbers  its not obvious yet of course how much of that reflects a permanent decline in
productivity and how much is transitory  but certainly the best guess is that some of it is more
long term in nature  i think the main point id like to make is that the implications of this
downward revision for inflation and monetary policy except perhaps in the very short run are
not obvious  the question is what is the effect of the lower productivity growth on aggregate
demand  we have examples of both types of phenomena  in the late 90s the pickup in
productivity growth stimulated a very strong boom working through the stock market
consumption and investment so it led to an overheating economy whereas in the earlier part of
this decade productivity growth picked up again but with weak aggregate demand  we had a
jobless recovery associated with that  so it remains to be seen exactly how aggregate demand
will respond to these developments  i do think that perhaps that in the very short run given
wage behavior and unit labor costs if i had to choose i would say that there is a slight bias
toward higher inflation and tighter money  in the longer run you would expect to see lower
longterm rates because of slower growth
the second issue that has been widely discussed around the table is the financial market
it is an interesting question why what looks like 100 billion or so of credit losses in the
subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth  so
its an interesting question about what is going on there  i think there are three reasons that the
financial markets have moved in the direction they have  first there has been a widespread
repricing of risk  that is obviously a healthy development particularly if there is no overshoot
which is a possibility  but all else being equal it is restrictive in terms of aggregate demand and
it makes our policy tighter than it otherwise would be  the second reason for the changes in
markets is that there has been a loss of confidence in the ability of investors to evaluate credit
quality particularly in structured products  there is an information fog as i have heard it
described  this is very much associated with the loss of confidence in the creditrating agencies
i think one of the implications of this is that some of the innovations we have seen in financial
markets are going to get rolled back  we are going to see more lending taken out of originateto
distribute vehicles and put back onto portfolio balance sheets  so the question is how much
effect this adjustment process will have on the availability of credit  the third reason that i think
the markets have reacted as much as they have is concern about the macroeconomic implications
of what is happening  in particular there is a fear that subprime losses repricing and the
tightening of underwriting standards will have adverse effects on the housing market and will
feed through to consumption and we will get into a vicious cycle  that certainly is reflected in
the expectations of policy
i am not going to go through all the things that are going on now in the markets  you
have had very good reviews of that  obviously the markets right now are not functioning
normally  some conduits of credit are simply closed or frozen  a number of companies are
having difficulties with shortterm finance and so per president fishers comment we are
watching those things very carefully  we are prepared to use the tools that we have to address a
shortterm financial crisis should one occur  in the longer term of course our policy should be
directed not toward protecting financial investors but rather toward our macroeconomic
objectives  that is very important  then the question is what the longrun implications of the
financial market adjustment will be for the economy  i think the odds are that the market will
stabilize  most credits are pretty strong except for parts of the mortgage market  but even so
there will be notably tighter credit tighter standards probably some loss of confidence in
markets and higher risk premiums that will on net be restrictive  this restrictive effect could
come in various magnitudes  it could be moderate or it could be more severe and we are just
going to have to monitor how it adjusts over time  again there is a bit of a riskand tail risk
has been mentioned not only in a financial sense but also in the macro sensethat if credit is
severely restricted so that we get feedback from lower house prices for example into the
financial markets that situation would be difficult to deal with
those are the two major issues that people have talked about  just very briefly on the
overall assessmenton the output side economic growth looks a little softer to me mostly
because of housing  there are also some slightly worrying developments in terms of automobile
demand which suggest some weakening in consumer spending  but there are some strong
elements as well  also the labor market has marginally softened  the unemployment rate is
about 25 basis points above its recent low so there has been some movement and i still expect
to see some reduction in construction employment  so i think there is a bit more softness and
there are a few more downside risks to output than at our last meeting  like others i think the
recent inflation data are moderately encouraging  i continue to see risks  if youre not satiated
with risks ill add one more which is that if the housing market really weakens and people go
back to renting we could get the same phenomenon that we saw last year by which rents are
driven up and we get an effect working through shelter costs  so i agree with those who still
view the risk to inflation as being tilted to the upside  if there are no comments or questions let
me turn now to brian to discuss the policy action
mr madigan3  thanks mr chairman  ill be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  financial markets have experienced exceptional strains over the intermeeting period  the bluebook provided a thorough review of these developments through thursday and i had intended to provide only a brief summary of and update on those developments as in exhibit 1 and some thoughts on their implications for monetary policy  but given the extensive discussions of this topic so far this morning those points seem all to have been made and i will turn directly to a discussion of policy alternatives
as noted at the top of exhibit 2 the risk of weakness in aggregate demand stemming from tighter credit conditions and disruptions in credit flows formed part of the rationale for the 25 basis point easing of alternative a that was presented in the bluebook  even if your views about the modal outlook are similar to the greenbook baseline forecast you may be concerned that the deterioration in credit conditions the significant increase in market volatility and potential declines in confidence have tilted the risks to growth distinctly to the downside  you may also see the recent spate of soft spending indicators as having raised the likelihood of sluggish growth in aggregate demand  the considerable gap between the greenbookconsistent real federal funds rate the dashed green line in the panel to the right and the range of modelbased estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate shown in red may add to questions about the possibility of weaker growth than in the staff forecast and reinforce your belief that some easing of policy is appropriate  moreover you may  be more optimistic than the staff about either productivity growth or the nairu or both  indeed as i mentioned earlier several of you noted just such optimism in the narratives accompanying your trialrun projections  the financial stimulus from a policy easing of course would help support growth directly  a policy action might be highly potent in current circumstances possibly helping to buoy consumer and business confidence in a period when sentiment may well be deteriorating  you may

3  materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3
also believe that the inflation outlook would support a nearterm policy easing  core inflation readings have been relatively subdued in recent months wage growth seems to have remained moderate and labor market pressures may be starting to ease although the evidence on that score is so far quite limited  in the staff forecast core inflation converges toward 2 percent an outcome that judging by your projections some of you would find acceptableand your forecasts suggest that you think the odds favor a prompter and slightly steeper decline in inflation
in contrast as noted in the bottom lefthand panel you may concur with the greenbook forecast for spending and prices given its policy assumptions but judge that the forecasted trajectory for inflation is too slow and leaves inflation at a level that is too high to foster optimal economic performance  if so you may be inclined to firm policy  percentage point as in alternative c  the decline in core inflation in the greenbook is slight and slow  as shown in the bottom right panel the optimal control simulation in the bluebook based on a 1 percent target for core pce inflation suggests an increase in the federal funds rate of about  percentage point over the next year  credibility or learning effects that might flow from a policy firming as in the simulation could limit the output and employment sacrifice necessary to foster a lower path for inflation  moreover you may agree with the staffs baseline assumption that the effects of current market strains will prove temporary that markets will soon resume clearing albeit at higher and perhaps more rational and moresustainable spreads and that the restraint on aggregate demand will be modest  finally you might see the risks to the inflation outlook as tilted to the upside given high levels of resource utilization and increased energy prices
alternative b discussed in exhibit 3 may be seen as an appropriate balancing of the considerations motivating alternative a on the one hand and alternative c on the other  under this alternative the committee would leave the stance of policy unchanged today  the statement would acknowledge the recent volatility of financial markets and tighter credit conditions but would also convey an expectation that moderate growth will likely continue  core inflation would be characterized as subdued in recent months but subject to upside risk  the committee would expressly refer to increased downside risk to growth but indicate that its predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected
a rationale for alternative b is laid out in the upper lefthand panel  in the baseline greenbook forecast the economy expands at a moderate pace resource pressures ease slightly and core inflation ebbs to 2 percent with the federal funds rate held at its current level through next year  that forecast may be close to your own view about the modal result and you may see it as an acceptable outcome  as shown to the right optimal control simulations based on the greenbook baseline and an assumed core inflation objective of 2 percent would suggest leaving the federal funds rate unchanged for the rest of the year before easing slightly  returning to the left hand panel holding steady at this meeting would also be consistent with the committees past behavior as captured by the estimated outcomebased and forecast based policy rules presented in the bluebook
you may also believe that alternative b represents a suitable weighting of the risks  for example even if you are a bit more optimistic about potential growth and the nairu than the staff you may nonetheless see maintaining the federal funds rate at its current level as an appropriate riskmanagement approach given the upside risks to inflation and the higher costs should they be realized  careful consideration of the most recent developments also may incline you toward alternative b  in particular even if the incoming data and increased financial market strains of recent weeks incline you to believe that the downside risks to growth have increased you may be quite unsure about the extent of those risks and not wish to exaggerate them as suggested by yesterdays developments it is not inconceivable that markets will soon begin to right themselves and that the greenbook baseline assumption of only modest financial restraint will prove correct  in these circumstances watchful waiting may be the best approach in order to allow more information to accumulate that will enable you to better assess the likely eventual adjustments of market prices and flows and the appropriate policy response  indeed you may be especially concerned about the risk of overreacting or being perceived as overreacting to temporary market developmentsparticularly if you see a significant probability that markets could misinterpret changes in the stance of policy or in your words as an indication that you place a higher priority on financial market stability or economic growth than on price stability  moreover your inflation concerns may not have diminished much if at all over the intermeeting period  while the most recent core inflation readings have been relatively low you may concur with the staff that some of that good performance will likely prove transitory  also overall inflation has remained high and with resource utilization elevated you may be worried that high rates of overall inflation could allow inflation expectations to move higher
the statement associated with the revised version of alternative b is provided in the bottom panel  given the volatile market conditions of late getting a reliable read on market participants expectations at this point is difficult but an announcement roughly along these lines seems to be anticipated by most market participants
notably the statement explicitly mentions downside risks to growth  that mention may be seen as opening the door a crack to future easing or at least giving the committee greater scope to move in that direction  although only a minority of market participants apparently expect the committee to point explicitly to downside risks to growth a sizable market reaction to the inclusion of such a reference in paragraph 4 seems unlikely as the committee still would state that inflation risks are its predominant concern
the final exhibit is an updated version of table 1 for your reference  changes relative to the bluebook are shown in red
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions of brian  if not lets
begin our goround  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman against this background of skittishness my best
advice would be to recognize to an extent in our statement what is going on in the marketplace
what ails the marketplace  the best guidance would be that we must not ourselves become a
tripwire  i think we have to show a steady hand  i rather liked the reference to the hippocratic
oath earlier do no harm  i think we can best accomplish this by acknowledging market
turbulence and yet not implying that we are given to a reaction that might create a moral hazard
im particularly mindful of the discussion in the press and by security analysts of a socalled
bernanke put and i want to make sure that we do not take any action or say anything that might
give rise to an expectation that such is to occur  therefore i would suggest that alternative b
offers the best policy response  that is i am in favor of keeping the rate where it is  the
wording in the second paragraph acknowledges that there has been volatility in the markets  i
think it addresses the points governor kohn made about growth in employment incomes and a
robust global economy  ive waited a long time to see the word global in these statements
laughter  whether it gets left in or not it does reflect reality  im mindful of president
geithners point of softening a little and yet that is where i worry that we might become a bit of
a tripwire  i would under normal circumstances be somewhat inclined toward the last paragraph
in alternative a and yet i didnt hear around the table nor do i fully believe myself that things
are exactly roughly balanced  i take the point that was made just now in the presentation that by
saying downside risks to growth have increased somewhat we are opening the door
the only refinement that i might suggest is that we soften a little the word before policy
concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  by taking out the word
predominant i would leave that up for consideration  i actually talked to somebody about this
earlier i want to acknowledge that  but otherwise i would stick with alternative b again
mindful that we are dealing with a skittish market situation and yet acknowledging the fact that a
sense around this table is that there are risks to growth that we are making progress on inflation
and yet there is no convincing evidence that we have completely turned the corner on the latter
front  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  its clear that the markets are very skittish  i
havent heard anyone suggesting that we should be changing the fed funds rate and i believe we
should keep it steady  so what is important now is what we say rather than the federal funds
rate  i think that the market is looking to us for leadership but we have to define exactly what
that means in a difficult market situation  i start by saying that we need to view the current
market situation not as unique but as a particular example of a class of events  each one has
unique characteristics but this is part of a notuncommon thing that happens  it happens every
now and then
so what should our response rule be to events like this not how should we respond to this
particular case  i think there are two things that we need to do given what we know at the
moment which obviously may change  what we know at the moment is in the current situation
we ought not to give any hint that we are trying to suggest a policy change at our next meeting
because i dont think we have enough information to say that such a hint would be appropriate
second we want to make clear to the markets our readiness to respond to the situation should the
environment change so that response by us would be helpful  now if we were to hint or if the
markets were to view what we say as hinting we could produce a positive market outcome this
afternoon  i dont doubt that  but then what  where do we go from there  would we having
given such a hint inadvertently or on purpose want to actually carry through at our next
meeting  that will depend on what we know at the next meeting but in the meantime we would
have created a market dynamic that would not be at all helpful  reducing the fed funds rate 25
basis points at the next meeting or the one after that is not going to fix the subprime market
that market is changing permanently from a situation of really very poor underwriting and the
market will fix it in due time and sort it out
i favor basically alternative b and the language there but i am concerned about
paragraph 4 that the market could interpret although the downside risks to growth have
increased somewhat as our effort to give a hint that we see a cut in the rate ahead  so i would
like to suggest a little different way of doing that  if you look in paragraph 2 at the sentence that
begins with nevertheless i would insert a sentence immediately ahead of that which says
consequently the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat  that follows the
discussion of the situation in the market credit conditions and so forth  then i would leave the
last paragraph the same as it was last time  the point of doing that is to make clear that the
downside risks to growth have increased somewhat but nevertheless the economy seems likely
to continue to expand at a moderate pace  that was what i would suggest we do so that we do
not inadvertently give a hint  we are aware that the markets are upset  we are making that very
clear but there is no intent to give a hint of policy action in our minds at our next meeting
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i guess the thing that strikes me first
about the current situation is that the incoming news on core inflation has been promising  at
least as far as im concerned the inflation outlook is satisfactory  so that in and of itself
suggests no change in policy  now if we append to that the financial market turmoil and the
adjustment that is under way there that does raise the risk to real growth  i think we have pretty
well acknowledged that in this discussion  but in my view that shouldnt prompt a change in
the federal funds rate target at this meeting for the reasons i cited earlier having to do with the
substantial uncertainties associated with all of this and of course i would be lax if i didnt
mention the resilience of the underlying economy that has been demonstrated through the period
of the great moderation  i do think its important though that we use the language to make sure
that the public is aware that we are aware of what is going on here  alternative b as drafted
largely does that  i dont think we should feel constrained at this point as we sometimes do to
try to make the changes to the language as few and far between as possible  im pretty
comfortable with alternative b as drafted  in fact i might be prepared to go even a little further
than b something closer to a balanced risk statement but i dont feel strongly enough about it to
insist on that even if i could  laughter
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i think we have a couple of issues in front of
us today  first do we react to the recent inflation numbers  i have been pleased by the recent
reports as i said coming in better than expected but there seems to be a substantial chance that
the improvement we have seen is temporary and that we will get some higher figures later this
year  moreover inflation expectations remain above where id like them to be so i dont think
we should relax our characterization of inflation in this statement  a second question we face is
how to react to the recent turmoil in financial markets  i think we need to be careful to maintain
our focus on the implications of market developments for the anticipated paths of inflation and
real spending  at this point i dont see those implications being substantial enough to warrant a
policy response on our part or a change in our sense of the likely nearterm policy path though
obviously this assessment may change as events unfold  absent evidence of such implications
our financial stability responsibilities can be met quite adequately through the automatic supply
of reserves under the desks operating procedures for targeting the overnight federal funds rate
or through the supply of reserves to solvent institutions at the discount window  unfortunately
the recent behavior of the fed funds futures market and recent financial press commentary
suggest that some market participants perhaps thinking back to 1987 or 1998 believe that
financial market turbulence per se will induce us to respond with interest rate cuts  even if we
did cut rates to counter financial market volatility financial market jitters might take some time
to dissipate  we may be reluctant to undo such rate cuts in the meantime and we would run the
risk that policy then becomes too easy and we get behind the curve  my main concern is the risk
that our communication today might mislead markets into thinking that we may cut rates in
response to assetprice volatility per se absent any expectation of sustained effects on the real
economy or inflation  accordingly i believe the statement language should acknowledge the
recent developments as in the second part of alternative b but not go any further  im concerned
about paragraph 4 and adding the passage about downside risks to growth increasing  im
concerned that it may go a bit too far in that direction  i think that the minutes should
acknowledge the problems in subprime and private equity markets and i also think the minutes
should educate financial markets that the mitigation of volatility in asset prices is not an fomc
objective  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president moskow
mr moskow  i didnt know i raised my hand but ill go anyway  laughter  i
certainly dont want to recommend a change in the fed funds target at this point mr chairman
so i agree with alternative b in terms of the fed funds rate portion  i do want to go on record
since this is my last meeting as saying that im not agreeing with alternative b because im
comfortable with a 2 percent quantitative guideline for inflation  but i am on balance
comfortable with alternative b  i am concerned about inflation  i think the improvement that we
see may be transitory as i mentioned  as president stern mentioned in his earlier comments
unit labor costs will likely be increasing and i think that although the forecast on inflation looks
promising there could be significant risks that it might go higher  in terms of the developments
in the financial markets i think we have all talked about them extensively  there is nothing
more to be said there  at this point it is a period of watchful waiting  i would agree with
president lacker with his comment about paragraph 4 of taking out the phrase that the downside
risks to growth have increased somewhat  i would prefer to see it in the minutes rather than in
the statement and i would prefer to have paragraph 4 exactly as we had it at the last meeting
chairman bernanke  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  as i said earlier i do think that the risks
to the outlook for economic growth have increased while the risks to the outlook for inflation
have moderated but are still to the upside  so i found the suggestion on page 25 of the bluebook
that we might want to mix and match the alternative a and b language appealing but i did think
that changing our statement in that way could convey a greater shift in our risk assessment than i
believe is warranted today  so i think the revised version of alternative b makes the modest but
important adjustment of acknowledging the recent change in credit conditions in the rationale
section and it signals the greater downside risks to growth in the risk assessment section  so i
support our alternative bthat is no change in the fed funds rate today and the language that is
in the revised version  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i think the inflation news has continued to be
encouraging but the risks remain on the upside  with respect to growth the prospects have
worsened and i think there is greater downside risk for the reasons that we have discussed  i
think the market response to these events is not inappropriate  they perceive a greater likelihood
that we will need to cut the fed funds rate sooner and more deeply than seemed likely only a few
weeks ago and i think we should essentially try to leave those expectations in place today to
indicate that we intend not to respond to asset prices or to the problems of particular dealers or
financial institutions directly but to assess the economic consequences of the turmoil
so the question is what is the right language to do that  the alternative b language that
is proposed is trying to achieve exactly what i think is appropriate  so i agree with the goal of
alternative b  im simply concerned about some of the actual language that is proposed
particularly i worry about the language in paragraph 4  when you say although the downside
risks to growth have increased somewhat the committees predominant policy concern remains
the risk that inflation will fail to moderate thats like sayingperhaps because i respond so
strongly to the word predominantthat yes we see greater downside risk but we dont care
we remain totally focused on inflation  laughter  that bothers me  thats how it comes across
to me  i dont think the intention is to make it that way
so i would make two proposals to soften it  i think what we need to do is dial it down
but i do think that inflation risk remains to the upside  i would second two suggestions that have
already been made  i would second president fishers suggestion that we remove the word
predominant from paragraph 4  we might say the committee remains concerned about the
risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  now i do think the downside risk has
increased on the growth side  im not sure it is actually necessary to say so explicitly and i think
dialing down paragraph 4 by simply removing predominant along with the additional
language that is proposed in line 2 might be sufficient  but i think that we actually do agree that
downside risks have increased  if we want to express that i would endorse president pooles
suggestion that we move the language about downside risks to paragraph 2 saying something
after for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing  we could
then say although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat nevertheless the
economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace  so we would get it in there
basically we would say that we see it but nevertheless we think most likely the economy will
grow at a moderate pace  if financial turbulence diminishes and markets stabilize not having
downside risks to growth in paragraph 4 and continuing to express some asymmetric bias some
worry about inflation well be comfortable living with that going forward and it is a good
summary of where we are  so those are my suggestions
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman a couple of things  first i am satisfied with the current
policy  i think that for the moment our concern should still be on inflation and i think our policy
is designed to address that  in saying that i also recognizefrom my own observations and
from what ive heard here todaythat more downside risks are emerging and that we have
brought the risks more in balance i guess is the way to say it  complicating that of course are
the tighter credit conditions  i think they are probably transitory but we wont know that for a
while yetmaybe by the next meeting  that leads me to conclude that i am comfortable with
alternative b and its language because i think it recognizes this dynamic and puts it out there for
the public  so i would stick with what we have in alternative b and then see how we develop
between now and the next meeting  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i am certainly comfortable with maintaining
the fed funds rate where it is so im supportive of that  i think the real key here is language
what are we trying to convey to the markets  how far can we go acknowledging what many
people sharea sense of some increased riskwithout creating another set of concerns in the
marketplace  so the language is the tricky piece here  ive waffled a bit in my feelings about
this  im inclined to be about where i think bill poole and janet yellen aremoving the
downside risks into paragraph 2 as opposed to putting them in the assessment of risk  i would be
supportive of that tone  also in response to some of jeffs comments in his earlier memo on
this i actually prefer the language of repricing of risk rather than of tightening credit conditions
simply because it emphasizes that this is partly a relative price adjustment that is going on  but i
dont want to take a strong stand on that
only one other word concerns me and id like to raise the issue here  in paragraph 3
which nobody has talked about yet in the first sentence readings on core inflation have been
relatively subdued in recent months is a change in the language from our previous statement
which says improved modestly recent months  i worry a little about the word subdued
because i think it becomes very close to making some kind of normative judgment about the
level of inflation that we are happy with  im uncomfortable about that particular change in the
language because it again might imply some normative statement without the committees
agreeing on what we view as being subdued or not  so id like to suggest that we change that
back to what it was before because if we want to convey stability and some continuity here
there are places to change there are places not to change and i would rather change fewer words
than more words going forward  that would be the only additional suggestion i would make
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i too feel that we should hold the rate
so i am concerned principally with the way the statement plays to the various audiences
particularly the market  the posture we should take is to acknowledge while not reacting
prematurely to the turbulence in the financial markets and the subdued or the improved inflation
numbers and we should make an effort to maintain some flexibility  so i am a bit torn on
paragraph 4 between president pooles suggestion which i have some sympathy for and the
concern that paragraph 4 will come across as ritualistic repetition of what weve said every
month for several months and therefore will convey a sense that were not paying attention to
whats going on in the market  so i come out ambivalent on that  i can support president
pooles suggestion but on balance i guess i like the statement in alternative b as it is
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i support leaving the target for the fed funds rate at 5 percent
however the news since the last meeting would seem to be more elevated downside risk to
economic growth  this elevated risk reflects the baseline growth for real gdp as 2 percent a
considerable reduction from the previous greenbook greater uncertainty about the evolution of
the housing market and concern about the fallout from financial market disruptions  given the
greater downside risk i would prefer language in the assessment of risk paragraph from
alternative a though i do like the modification to alternative b that was made and i am worried
about an interpretation of a fed put for financial markets  so although id prefer the risk
assessment in alternative a which more accurately reflects my assessment of risks i could
certainly accept removing the word predominant  that would be my second choice  my third
choice would be to bow to those who have a better understanding of nuanced language since
that is certainly not my expertise though i hope i will develop it over the years and i could live
with the alternative b language as my third choice
chairman bernanke  okay  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  like the others i think keeping the federal
funds rate where it is is the right thing to do  we need as others have said to watch the situation
carefully and see how it evolves  i think were trying to do two things with this statement as
others have remarked  one is to make people aware that were aware that a major market event
has occurred and to say that were looking at it and trying to assess its implications for the
outlook but that it hasnt reallynot yet anyhowcaused a major change in our fundamental
assessment of where the economy is going  the second thing we are trying to do is make sure
that we have a flexible platform we can move from over the next couple of meetings or even
should it become necessary in the intermeeting period  so one can see this going in lots of
different directionsthe markets getting much more turbulent with implications for the outlook
and we need to move in the intermeeting period or things settling down and we go back to
inflation as the predominant risk  the incoming data on demand and production remain
consistent with the central forecast  as i and some others noted we could end up coming out of
this and easing policy somewhere down the road but not right away
i thought the language of alternative b did both of those things  it acknowledged the
situation  it reinforced the sense that moderate growth going forward was where we thought
things were going because we added the supported by solid growth in employment and incomes
and a robust global economy  so we have some rationale for that which we didnt have before
i also thought that paragraph 4 was a really accurate reading  i was actually a little surprised
through the goround just how almost universally people said that the downside risks to output
have increased but that they were still most concerned about inflation  so i thought that
paragraph 4 turned out to be prescientlyon the part of the chairman brian or whoever drafted
ita really accurate view of where the committee was  my concern about moving the first
piece of that into paragraph 2 is that then we have one risk in paragraph 2  we havent done that
before right  the risks to output and to inflation have all been talked about in paragraph 4
another risk is in paragraph 4 the risk to inflation and that is an asymmetry of how we discuss
risks  it was intended to soften the risk but i think it strikes me as creating a precedent that in
the future will be hard to live with when some risks are in some paragraphs and other risks are in
other paragraphs  another thing we could do is move the inflation risk into paragraph 3 and not
come down one way or another  but i think the committee wants to come down on the inflation
sidein terms of predominant risk or main riskand the committee isnt quite ready to go to
balance  so it seems to me that paragraph 4 as written really captured the center of gravity of
the committee  so i am in favor of that
one word on the moral hazard and the concern about being seen as reacting  i am not
worried about it  i think we have kept our eye through the past twenty years on the macro
environment  we have adjusted policy to stabilize the economy to bring inflation down and we
were pretty darn successful in all of that  asset prices go up and asset prices go down
anybody who bought a lot of hightech stock betting on the greenspan put is still waiting to
recover their money  laughter  i dont think it ever existed  i really dont care what people
say i care about what we do and we just need to keep our eye on those macro implications
now as i said in my presentation i think the connection between the financial markets and the
macroeconomy is pretty complicated and runs through confidence and other things too  but im
not really worried about a moral hazard from acting  should markets continue to be turbulent
and we see that turbulence in the futurei agree with the vice chairman that we have to be
forward looking in thissuch turbulence has the potential for adversely affecting the economy
i think we should go ahead and act  i think we basically did the right thing in 87 and 98 and i
dont think we need to apologize for it  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  before diving into alternative b id say part of
the reason that we are trying on different clothes around the language in alternative b is that we
have an odd juxtaposition of growth and inflation at this time  that is because the growth risks
seem to be driven largely by a financial market situation that we still dont totally understand and
we even have some disagreement about how quickly we will come to that understanding  so unlike
our typical juxtapositions when we have intermediate concerns about inflation and about growth
here it strikes me that the differences are in timing and in magnitudethat is if the downside risk
from the financial markets happens soon and were in the middle of it and we just dont see it yet
boy we might know it soon and that could have very ugly outcomes  i think there are differences
here  i also think there are differences in our power  our power over inflation is pretty darn good
and we can exercise that kind of judgment  our power over getting in the middle of these markets
by moving rates  percentage point or moving our language is harder for me to decipher  thats
why i think the suggestions about the language of alternative b are good ones and they are hard for
us to all wrestle with
the reason i come down for alternative b as written is that it strikes me that we have two
goals  one is to be as clear as we can be with the markets notwithstanding their expectations of
what we see and i think alternative b does that  the second goal is trying to buy ourselves some
insurance and some flexibility  i worry that if we were to drop predominant which has become
part and parcel of their view of where we are it might turn out that these markets are benign and
this isnt the storm i talked about just a moment ago and it will be hard to go back to that word  i
dont know how we go back to predominant in september or in the meeting after that if we have
dropped it  so in some ways i think the question is as in the poole approach do you drop
predominant and move the downside risks to paragraph 2 and is that roughly equivalent to
alternative b as is  the reason i do not think so is that alternative b as is provides us with more
flexibility to end up dropping the downside risks if that eventuality comes to pass  so for the
reasons that governor kohn has given i think we probably have the right construct here in
alternative b  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i also support keeping the fed funds rate
unchanged and i very much agree with the way that governor kohn was thinking about what were
trying to achieve  so let me just describe why i think that alternative b as is largely achieves that
the key to my thinking about the decision on changing the statement is first whether something
has materially changed so that the markets will realize that when we change the statement we do so
because something has actually happened and second whether it gives us the flexibility going
forward to make another change if new information comes in  so for example in paragraph 2
acknowledging the volatility and talking about credit conditions about the housing market and then
about the offsetting factors of employment growth in income and global demandall those things
are relevant  the new thingsthe financial markets and credit conditionshave been there a bit
but are now more important than they were before  so were acknowledging things that actually
have happened in the intermeeting period  i also like that it gives a bit more color about whats
going on and how were thinking about things and each piece is one that we can easily leave add
to or take back and that is very valuable  so i like the formulation of paragraph 2 because it both
acknowledges new information that has come in and does so not in a way that suggests fear or
excess concern but just sort of acknowledges various factors particularly the financial conditions in
the context of others on the upside  the balance is i think very nice
on paragraph 3 i agree with president plosser that it is not clear to me that we had new
information so that we would want to change the characterization  i see nothing wrong with the
characterization that we have there  i am not as concerned as president plosser is that it makes more
of a value judgment  but my question is just why we have made the change  i am happy with
either way but using my criterion that if no information is new why change i am not quite sure why
we changed it  i think it is fine either way
on paragraph 4 i think it is very important to take a step toward balance without going all
the way toward balance because it is much too early to tell as many people have said  putting the
downside risks there makes a lot of sense because of the tradition of the structure  again i dont
see any reason to change the overall formulation or the overall structure at this point particularly
when the markets are jittery  i dont think we should be going about a sort of structural change in
the statement  even if ultimately we might want to think about it i do not think this would be the
time to do it  also i like that it is very easy to put on and take off so that if growth does come back
up we can easily remove the language  if growth goes down we can move toward balance of risk
very easily there if we want to and as governor warsh said if we drop predominant we cannot
get that back  i feel that we are not at a stageor at least from the discussion around the table and
from where i amwhere we should do that  also i think you would have a very strong reaction in
the markets  if the markets saw that we both acknowledged the downside risk and took out
predominant or even just took out the word predominant that would indicate a much stronger
risk and be a much stronger signal that we are going to move more quickly  i do think that this
statement as is will lead to a slight increase in expectations of a cut a little earlier but thats
perfectly acceptable because i cant see any better way to get the balance right  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  obviously i agree that we should not have a
change in the federal funds rate  so i want to talk about the statement  when i think about the
statement that i would write a key thing from my viewpoint is just to ask what the inflation
objective is because it really affects the statement in a major way  i believe that a 2 percent goal is
reasonable for reasons that i have discussed before  in that context inflation has moderated and so
i would have difficulty saying that we are concerned that it has not moderated when i think in fact
it has  but i do have to say that i think we want to stick with alternative b as it is written here for
two reasons  the first reason is that i am actually in a conflicting situation because it is not clear
whether i should think about writing a statement thats appropriate for governor mishkin or a
statement thats appropriate for the committee as a whole  we are going to have to deal with this
challenge  when i read the projections its clear to me that im on the high side that my 2 percent
is higher than the median which is around 1 or 18  i would not have difficulty accepting an
inflation objective of 18 as long as the committee came to a consensus  i think that the issue of
writing the statement is much more difficult when we dont have consensus of the committee  it is
creating a problem for me in terms of thinking about how to get involved in the internal deliberation
on what the statement should be and that will be important in the future  i do not think that now is
the time to deal with that  so one of the issues then is lets deal with that at some point in the future
the second reason is the issue of what is going on in terms of the financial markets and what
kind of impression we give outside  i agree with governor kohn that we have not been operating
under a greenspan put or a fed put  it is very clear to me that we have not been doing so except
that i think an impression has been created and i would like to mention that i am a little less
sanguine about what was done in the past  i think that one mistake was made perhaps because im
looking at it ex post  when the fed lowered interest rates 75 basis points in the ltcm episode it
was a brilliant stroke  it was exactly the right thing to do  but when you think about an operation
like that which was basically to restore confidence to the markets and was very much like a classic
lenderoflastresort operation we know that you want to put in liquidity but when the crisis is
over you want to take it out  at that time i was quite critical that the fed did not then remove the
75 basis point decline and i think it created an impressioni dont know about a greenspan put
but there was some element of thatand it is very hard to dissipate that impression  maybe it is
true that people said we werent trying to do that but we did create some kind of impression along
those lines  so i think the issue of perception still is important  in that context it is very important
that we not give the impression that we are responding to financial markets now because the
discussion here has been that we are very concerned that this might be a problem in the future but
right now it is not affecting our forecast in a major way  thats exactly what we have to
communicate to the public and the markets and in that context changing the statement too much in
moving toward balance will create problems along those lines
if i were not worrying about these issues i would take the word predominant out of the
statement  in fact i might even take out the issue that im worried about that we say inflation has
not moderated  but given the current situation i think it is best that we stick with predominant
that we mention downside risks to growth and then the predominant side in terms of inflation
does create an element of balance  thus i think there is a potential issue that we have to worry
about in future statements and that we will have to grapple with  i hope that this committee could
come to a consensus on what our inflation objective is so that we can have a more coherent
discussion of these issues however i do not think this is the time to pursue that  so i support
alternative b as written  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  about classic lenderoflastresort operations we asked people at the open
market desk how much additional reserves it takes to lower the federal funds rate  percentage
point  it is on the order of a couple of ten millionso 75 basis points added maybe 100 maybe
150 million in that instance  you know id venture that that was probably trivial in terms of
adding liquidity to the market after ltcm  the real effect it had was altering the thencurrent and
expected path of the real overnight federal funds rate  as you know rick the classic lenderoflast
resort option had to do with the 1900s and preventing interest rates from spiking above current rates
not from adding reserves or driving down interest rates  so i think it is a confusion to link things
like what we did in 87 or 98 to the classic lenderoflastresort operation
mr mishkin  but theres always an issue about what we mean by the word classic
what im thinking about here is that a lenderoflastresort operation is really about restoring
confidence  it can be done without actually putting any liquidity into the system  if you look at a
successful lenderoflastresort operation just the announcement that you will be a backstop for the
system has tremendous impact  of course this is one reason that what was done in 87with
greenspan not actually sitting in the tub that morning but getting up early and announcing before
the market opened that the federal reserve was going to be a backstopwas extremely important
im thinking of it in that context which is that we wanted to provide information to the markets
which was that we were going to be there and that we were not going to be the bank of japan and
allow something to spiral out of control  clearly it was basically taking out insurance saying that
the fed will be there  once you dont need insurance anymore theres a really strong argument to
take it away  so im not talking about this in terms of liquidity per se but what we are trying to do
in terms of expectations  that episode was important for doing the right thing which was critical to
the way the financial markets recovered but i think a problem was created when we didnt reverse
it in the same way that when you actually do a lenderoflastresort operation you put liquidity in
and you take it out  thats the sense in which i mean putting lower interest rates in and then taking
them out when the crisis is over
chairman bernanke  all right  let me get us back to the statement  laughter
vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  just quickly i think we are
actually all in a fairly similar place not far apart in our basic diagnosis and thats good given the
complexity of our decisions going forward in some sense  we want to soften slightly the
asymmetry in our current statement to give us a bit more flexibility and to show some awareness of
the change in the reality out there
quickly on the statement first i agree that on the question of how we characterize and how
we display some recognition of financial market developments the reference to volatility itself may
not capture it  somebody suggested that we say something instead about going to risk premium
or something more generally and i think that might be slightly bettera small point  the second
question is whether we should revert to june on the inflation readings in response i think to the
right observation by president plosser that this does convey more comfort with a level than the
previous wording did  so i would be fine going back to june but i could also live with this because
it conveys a sense that the readings have been and continue to be reasonably favorable  so i would
be fine with the way it is but i could go back to the june language
on the question about whether we refer explicitly to downside risks to growth which well
be doing for the first timea sort of consequential actand if so how we do it  i would have been
fine leaving it implicit rather than introducing it explicitly  i think don is right  if were going to
do it unless were going to change the structure of the statement significantly and put some risk
assessment on growth in paragraph 2 and some risk assessment around inflation in paragraph 3 then
we need to leave it in paragraph 4  so again on the risks to growth im okay with putting that
language in  i think its consistent with the broad objectives  i guess my preference would have
been to leave it implicit
finally on predominant my own view is that we should not repeat predominant and
that we would be better off simply stating that the committee remains concerned about the risks or
concerned that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  i dont think the arguments for sticking
with predominant are that compelling  i dont think that taking it out constrains our options going
forward  it is true that its a shift in some broad sense but i dont think we need to say so starkly
now that weve looked at this set of risksvery different types of risk some very fast moving very
uncertain and some slower moving probably manageable over timeand say that we weighed that
balance and we think the latter risks continue to predominate  i think thats the substance of the
argument we face  i think it would be better to slightly soften that further  having said all of that i
can live with alternative b as drafted  laughter
mr mishkin  may i make a twohanded intervention
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  could i ask a question of brian  predominant is a key word  so what
do you think might be the response of the markets if we leave it in or take it out in terms of two
elements  one is the issue of how the markets would think about the future evolution of our policy
two is how the media might read whether we are reacting to the distress in the financial markets
mr madigan  well as i said earlier its a little hard to judge market reactions right
now given the flux in financial markets  that said i do think that the introduction of downside
risks as an explicit phrase in the statement will obviously not be overlooked by market
participants laughter and i think that they will see it as at least some slight shift in the
committees body english  with regard to predominant thats just another step in the same
directionand i think maybe even a bigger shift
mr mishkin  right
mr dudley  i think it is a bigger shift  i think if the first is one unit the second is
maybe two units in terms of how far you go
chairman bernanke  president moskow
mr moskow  i just have another objection to taking out the word predominant  i
dont think the sentence makes any sense if you take it out  laughter  you have to put something
in  you cannot say that it is our only problem
chairman bernanke  well right  you really have to rewrite the sentence  let me
try to evaluate this with your guidance  laughter  so i agree with brian that this is one of the
toughest ones to write and to assess the response  if you read the commentary expectations are all
over the map and so it is very difficult to know how this will be taken  i dont pretend to know
let me start with something easy  i think that president plosser is absolutely right  there is no
reason to change paragraph 3 without a reason  so unless anyone has concerns id like to change
paragraph 3 back to the june language  okay  thats the first thing
regarding the tougher questionand president yellen president poole and others have
raised an interesting possibilityagain without much confidence i am going to resist it for the
following reasons  the first reason is mostly that it is complicated laughter and it moves things
around in ways that will make it even harder for the market to understand what were trying to do
another reason is that the statement although the downside risks to growth have increased
somewhat if we follow your advice and put it after the new sentence in paragraph 2 will
essentially say that the financial markets are the reason that the downside risks have increased
whereas there are other factorsthe housing market automobile sales and things of that sortthat
could be viewed as increasing the downside risks  so i guess thats my recommendation  on
predominant i think the word has been neutralized to a significant extent by its use  you may
recall that we used the phrase predominant policy concern and we changed the second sentence
and the market based on that decided that we had gone all the way to balance  my concern is that if
we get rid of predominant and if we mention the downside risks to growth anywhere that will be
viewed as having gone mostly to balance and i dont think thats where we are right now as a
committee
i have one thought which may have come too late in the day here  this is going back to
paragraph 2 financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks  president geithner raised the
idea of changing that to something about risk  one small concern i have and it would have been
good had we put this in earlier is that the phrase refers to something going on in the markets per se
and not an effect of the markets on the economy which heightens some of the put risk a little  an
alternative would be to replace that first phrase with something like investors have demanded
greater compensation for risk  that would be a market development that evidently affects yields
and borrowing costs  i see some nodding  i see some frowning  so im not sure
mr mishkin  could you clarify  are you saying that you would then get rid of credit
conditions have become tighter
chairman bernanke  no  investors have demanded greater compensation for risk
credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses  all right  no
excitement
mr lacker  it is not clear whether probability distributions over the fundamentals have
shifted or whether the probability distribution over marginal utility has shifted  do you see what i
mean
chairman bernanke  no  laughter
mr lacker  it is not clear whether their attitudes to a given risk have changed or their
assessments of the magnitude of the risks have changed
chairman bernanke  oh i see what youre saying  well actually the way i
phrased it was intentionally not to say that risks have increased but rather to say that the price of risk
has increased
mr lacker  but that says one of them  that says the latter
chairman bernanke  but thats what i want it to say
mr lacker  but thats not clear  it is not clear that it isnt just a widening of the
probability distribution over the relevant outcomes
chairman bernanke  okay  i dont see any snowball  laughter
vice chairman geithner  dont give up yet  risk premiums in financial markets
have increased credit conditions have tightened for some householdsit is true that you dont
really know what the source of the increase in risk premiums is but it is true that risk premiums
have increased  volatility itself is not particularly interesting from a policy perspective and as
many people have said were not here to damp volatility  the considerations relevant to the
macroeconomy and to financial market stability in some sense are what happenedand thats a
different way of saying it
mr lacker  no it encompasses both of what i was referring to and so that would be a
way to do it
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  i would agree with that  now that doesnt say that pricing has changed  let
me give you an example  kimberlyclark last week went to market on 2 billion in debt  they
couldnt move it unless they had a changeofcontrol provision  no price impact  so it is part of the
risk premiums but were not seeing pricing per se  i like the wording that president geithner has
suggested
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner  im sorry  you were next
mr kroszner  yes in principle i think that is a good way to characterize whats going
on  but going back to the criteria that i was using in many cases the risk premiums have simply
moved close to historical levels from record lows  so if they stay at historical averages over time
thats not necessarily something thats wrong or problematic  it may be very difficult to take that
phrase away if risk premiums stay where they are in at least some of the markets  i dont think
thats necessarily a bad thing and ive heard a number of people around the table suggest that  in
certain markets they have been above historical averages but in many markets they have simply
moved to the historical average and i am just a bit concerned about being able to take that away
chairman bernanke  well just to say have increased and then have the next
phrase say credit conditions have become tighter also makes no value judgment on whether
theyre appropriate
mr kohn  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  governor kohn do you have a comment
mr kohn  yes i do  i see why you want to take out volatile and i agree with that
unlike president lacker i think it is important to keep credit conditions in there because its more
than just price  so i was a little concerned that saying risk premiums have increased and credit
conditions have become tighter puts it all on price  suppose we didnt have the phrase in red  we
just had owing to developments in financial markets credit conditions have become tighter or
reflecting recent developments in financial markets credit conditions have become tighter
vice chairman geithner  i am okay with that
mr kohn  i prefer risk premiums
mr moskow  you could just go back to the original language in the bluebook  it says
essentially the same thing  just change the sentence around
chairman bernanke  i think that is a good idea  credit conditions are becoming
tighter  we saw that in the bank surveys before any of this happened
mr moskow  that is in the bluebook
chairman bernanke  i understand but i think that some acknowledgement of the
effects of financial market developments in the recent weeks on the economy is needed just to make
sure that people understand that were awake
mr kohn  so the proposed language is risk premiums and financial markets
chairman bernanke  have increased credit conditions have become tighter  and
the housing
mr mishkin  fine with me
mr madigan  i just want to point out mr chairman that those two clauses seem to
overlap to a considerable degree tighter risk premiums and tighter credit conditions  its not
clear to me precisely what distinction were trying to draw there
mr mishkin  well credit conditions is more general because it can encompass both
price and nonprice
mr madigan  so it raises a question in my mind as to why the first clause is necessary
chairman bernanke  well think of it as being markettraded assets and credit
conditions sounds like mortgages retail type of credit provision  president hoenig
mr hoenig  im okay if you want to put premium the vice chairmans language in
there  but i think that the markets have become more volatile and nothing is wrong with saying
that and credit conditions have tightened which is a fact and people are thinking about the
volatility of the markets  so that is on their minds  were acknowledging it as you said and so i
was comfortable with the language
chairman bernanke  okay  let me just get a sense around the table if i could  i
think president hoenig makes the point that volatility in financial markets could be viewed as
having an effect on the economy through uncertainty and those sorts of factors  one option is
financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks  the second option is risk premiums in
financial markets have increased  who wants volatility  laughter  i see five  who wants to
make the change
mr kohn  i guess i would
chairman bernanke  oh great  laughter  all right
mr mishkin  we flip a coin
mr kohn  you have the deciding vote
chairman bernanke  okay
mr lacker  one factor for me is that volatility is a very broad term and risk
premiums refers to a narrow set of markets and this way shifts the focus off equity markets
chairman bernanke  okay  i apologize profusely for bringing this up  why dont
we just leave it  laughter  so after all the discussion my proposal is to follow president plosser
and to replace paragraph 3 with the june version  please call the roll
ms danker  ill read the directive wording from the bluebook and the balance of risk
assessment from brians handout
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with
maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5 percent
although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat the committees
predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  future
policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied
by incoming information
chairman bernanke                             yes
vice chairman geithner                      yes
president hoenig                                 yes
governor kohn                                   yes
governor kroszner                              yes
governor mishkin                               yes
president moskow                               yes
president poole                                    yes
president rosengren                            yes
governor warsh                                  yes
chairman bernanke  the next meeting is september 18  let me remind you that
we will be discussing briefly on september 18 and in october the communication issues  let me
ask you please to be reticent about discussing this please be nontransparent about transparency
laughter in our discussions so that we dont frontrun ourselves too much  i would appreciate that
im going to adjourn formally but if you can tolerate a few extra minutes at the table we would like
to give laricke a chance just to give us a very quick update on congressional matters and then we
will move upstairs for lunch for president moskow  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
