transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of april 2930 2008
april 29 2008afternoon session
chairman bernanke  lets formally begin the meeting  let me start by
welcoming our new colleague jim bullard from st louis over there in the heartland section of
the table  laughter  we welcome you and we look forward to your contribution and to
working with you
i want just to note that there has been some interest in doing more work collectively
board members and presidentson various issues relating to bank supervision and regulation
we have some work streams planned governor kohn will talk about this a bit tomorrow during
our lunch and we will discuss some of those things  let me now turn to bill dudley to discuss
desk operations  bill if you would also talk about some of the proposals for expanding
liquidity support  thank you
mr dudley1  certainly  thank you mr chairman  the financial market environment has improved markedly since midmarch  however concern about the circumstances that led to the demise of bear stearns may have provided added impetus to the ongoing deleveraging process  the result has been improvement in the broader equity and fixedincome markets but heightened term funding pressure within the financial system
turning first to the broader markets improvement is evident across most broad asset classes both in the united states and abroad  as shown in exhibit 1 of the handout in front of you the broad us equity indexes have recovered much of their earlier losses  although the financial sector still lags behind financial share prices have in the aggregate recovered more than 10 percent off their midmarch trough credit markets have also improved  as shown in exhibit 2 corporate credit spreads in both the investmentgrade and the highyield sectors have narrowed somewhat moreover global credit default swap spreadsas shown in exhibit 3have fallen significantly  as shown in exhibit 4 measures of implied volatility in the treasury equity and foreign exchange markets have declined
signs of a recovery in risk appetite can be seen very clearly in the subprime mortgagebacked securities market and the municipal securities market both which

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
had earlier experienced significant distress  exhibit 5 shows the price performance of the aaarated tranches of the last four abx subprime vintages  as can be seen the aaarated tranches have recovered even though housing activity and home prices have continued to decline at least as fast as anticipated  in the municipal market crossover buyers have entered attracted by municipal bond yields that exceed those available on treasuries of comparable maturities  as seen in exhibit 6 although the ratios of taxexempt to treasury yields of comparable maturities remain elevated there has been considerable improvement during the past two months  this improvement has occurred even though the outlook for the monoline financial guarantors remains poor  ambacs announcement last week of a 17 billion loss in the first quarter madethus farbarely a ripple in the broader market
the introduction of the primary dealer credit facility pdcf seems to have helped to stabilize the repo markets  that improvement in turn has caused the equity prices of the four remaining large investment banks to recover somewhat and their credit default swap spreads to fall sharply exhibits 7 and 8  the pdcf backstop facility also appears to have helped break the negative dynamic of higher haircuts forced asset sales lower prices higher volatility and still higher haircuts that was in place in the weeks leading up to the bear stearns liquidity crisis
although the collateral haircuts set by the major dealers for their hedge fund clients in our april 9 surveyshown in exhibit 9are considerably higher than in the previous month our contacts indicate that this rise occurred mostly around the time of bear stearnss demise  over the past few weeks haircuts have stabilized
despite the improvement in the broad market indexes and in the equity prices and credit default swap spreads of most major financial firms term funding pressures have intensified rather than subsided  as shown in exhibits 10 and 11 the pressures have been evident at both the onemonth and the threemonth tenures in the united states the euro area and the united kingdom  the additional deleveraging by the investment banks following the demise of bear stearns may have intensified the pressure on commercial bank balance sheets or the urge for banks to delever
the libor indexes took a jump upward following a wall street journal article that alleged that some of the 16 libor panelists were understating the rates at which they could obtain funding  the british bankers association reacted by threatening to throw out any panelist that was not wholly honest in its daily posting of its costs of obtaining funds at different maturity horizons  the bba announcement appears to have provoked an outbreak of veracity among at least some of the panelists  as shown in exhibit 12 the libor fixing rose nearly 20 basis points in the few days immediately after the article  the dispersion in offered rates between the highest and lowest posting banks also increased  there is considerable evidence that the official libor fixing understates the rates paid by many banks for funding  for example as shown in exhibit 13 the allin cost of fx swap financing into dollars out of euros has recently climbed to more than 30 basis points above the cost of libor funding
the term funding pressures appear to be mainly the consequence of the deleveraging process that is still firmly under way  balance sheet capacity has become strained in three ways  first pressures to carry more assets on the balance sheet have increased in a number of ways  for example some types of assets can no longer be securitized and balance sheet assets are created when lines of credit are drawn upon  second loanloss provisions and marktomarket losses have cut into capital at least until recently faster than banks have been able to raise new capital third desired capital ratios have undoubtedly risen as financial markets have become more volatile and the macroeconomic outlook has worsened  these pressures have sharply pushed up the shadow price of balance sheet capacity and term funding spreads undoubtedly reflect that pressure  as evidence note how the spread between jumbo and conforming fixedrate mortgage yields in exhibit 14 has mostly tracked the trajectory of term funding spreads shown in exhibit 13  because banks can securitize conforming mortgages but not jumbo mortgages this widening spread likely reflects the rise in the shadow price of balance sheet capacity  the term funding pressures have also been evident in the strong demand exhibited in our biweekly taf auctions as shown in exhibit 15 the spread between the stopout rate and the minimum bid rate has risen sharply since late january despite the large rise in the size of the taf auctions over this period
in contrast the demand by primary dealers to borrow treasury securities in our term securities lending facility tslf has been less intense  it is unclear whether this reflects the large and immediate scale of these auctions 175 billion offered over four weeks or less need by primary dealers who rely heavily on secured repo borrowing for their shortterm funding needs  as shown in exhibit 16 two of the five auctions have not been fully covered  besides providing liquidity to the primary dealers the tslf auctions have helped to generate a dramatic improvement in treasury market function  as shown in exhibit 17 before the first tslf auction overnight treasury repo rates were unusually low and the treasury market was distorted by a growing number of security failures that is dealers were unable to deliver promised securities and a large number of securities trading special that is with a repo rate below the rate on general treasury collateral
so have the taf and tslf auctions been helpful in improving market function although it is impossible to know what the counterfactual would have been without the auctions most evidence suggests that these auctions have improved market function  although a recent study by john taylor and john williams found no statistical evidence that the taf auctions have had an effect on term funding the choices in terms of econometric design made it very difficult for this study to have found an effect  interestingly minor changes in the specification used by taylor and williams produce statistically significant results with the expected signin other words the taf auctions reduced the spread
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words  exhibit 18 documents the federal reserves major initiatives over the past eight months relative to the libor ois spread  note that virtually all the federal reserve initiatives aimed at improving
market function have been associated with a decline in the liborois spread perhaps this just represents an announcement or placebo effect  more study is obviously needed  however it is interesting that those market participants who are the patients have been clamoring for more medicine in the form of both an increase in the size of the taf auctions and auctions with longer maturities
as the equity and credit markets have improved market participants have reduced their expectations of the magnitude of further monetary policy easing  as shown in exhibit 19 the federal funds rate futures curve has shifted upward and is virtually flat around 2 percent from may though septemberimplying that market participants expect that tomorrow will likely be the last easing in this cycle  the eurodollar futures curve which is shown in exhibit 20 has shifted up even more sharply since the last fomc meeting  in part this reflects the rise in term funding spreads and most important the view that these spreads are likely to remain elevated relative to the target federal funds rate for the foreseeable future
our survey of primary dealers undertaken about ten days before each fomc meeting shows more stability in dealer expectations exhibits 21 and 22  note that the dealer forecasts now anticipate somewhat greater easing than implied by the federal funds rate futures market and the eurodollar futures market  this is quite different from the pattern in previous months  the average of the dealer modal forecasts has a trough in yields of about 150 percent about  percentage point below the market forecast  in terms of this weeks meeting there is little disagreement between the dealer survey and market participants  all 18 of the primary dealers that responded to our survey anticipate a rate cut at this meeting with nearly all in the 25 basis point rate cut camp  as shown in exhibit 23 this is slightly more aggressive than the expectations embodied in federal funds rate options which are pricing in a probability of a 25 basis point easing of almost 80 percent  the shift in interest rate expectations cannot be explained easily by developments on the inflation front
although the continued surge in crude oil prices has pushed aggregate commodity indexes such as the gsci higher agricultural and industrial metal prices have been much more stable in recent weeks exhibit 24  despite the rise in energy prices marketbased measures of longterm inflation compensation have fallen in recent weeks  for example as shown in exhibit 25 both the boards and barclays five year fiveyearforward measures have declined about 40 basis points from the peak reached in early march
turning to the desks operations we get mixed grades over the intermeeting period  on the one hand we have done a pretty good job of hitting the target on average through yesterday the daily effective rate since the last fomc meeting was a miraculous 225 percent  on the other hand this average conceals considerable intraday and daytoday volatility  this can be seen in exhibit 26 which charts the daily federal funds rate range and the daily average effective rate  notice how wide the daily range of trading has been  this reflects three factors  1 the demand by european banks for federal funds which has often caused the federal funds rate to be elevated early in the day before europe closes 2 stigma associated with primary
credit facility pcf borrowingthe pcf rate is not a firm cap on federal funds rate trading and 3 large unanticipated shifts in the autonomous factors that affect the level of reserves in the banking systemespecially shifts in the level of pcf and pdcf borrowing  note the big rise in pcf and pdcf borrowing since midmarch and the large daily shifts in the level of this borrowing shown in exhibit 27  we have little ability to forecast these daily shifts in borrowing  thus these shifts are mostly unexpected and do increase the volatility of the federal funds rate
finally let me briefly outline a number of policy recommendations for which we seek your approval  first i will need approval for domestic operations  there were no foreign operations  second as noted in the memo that was circulated to you last week we are recommending that the outstanding swap lines with canada and mexico be renewed for another year  third the staff is recommending approval of an increase in the size of the foreign exchange swap facilities with the european central bank and the swiss national bank  this recommendation is discussed in more detail in a memo that was distributed to the fomc last friday  for the ecb the recommendation is to increase the size of the swap line to 50 billion from
30 billion and for the snb to 12 billion from 6 billion with maximum draws on these facilities of 25 billion and 6 billion respectively  we also recommend extending the term of these swap facilities to january 30 2009 from september 30 2008  as before these swap lines will be used in conjunction with our taf auctions to increase the amount of 28day term dollar funding available to banks with operations in the euro area and in switzerland  at the same time we understand that chairman bernanke intends to use his delegated authority from the board to increase the size of the taf to 150 billion from 100 billion
fourth we recommend that eligible collateral for the tslf be broadened to include aaarated assetbacked securities abs  currently as you know this facility accepts only aaarated residentialmortgagebacked securities and commercialmortgagebacked securities  we believe that broadening the eligibility to aaarated abs will help support the availability of consumer credit including credit card auto and student loan credit  spreads in aaarated abs backed by auto loans and credit card receivables have risen sharply over the past six months even though the deterioration in the underlying performance of the assets in terms of delinquency and loss has been well within the bounds of past cycles  we do not recommend increasing the collateral eligibility by greater breadth than this  as we noted in last fridays memo including additional classes of securities could increase operational costs to an extent that is not likely to be warranted by the marginal benefits  it could also expose the system to the risks associated with a range of complex structured finance products and in the case of aaarated corporate securities would not provide much benefit because the amounts of such securities outstanding are relatively small  under this proposal the maximum size of the tslf would remain unchangedat 200 billionas would the other terms of the facility
i also want to inform the committee of a small technical change that the staff plans to make in the tslf program  we plan to eliminate the requirement that
eligible aaarated securities not be on watch for downgrade  we plan to make this change because we have found that enforcing this rule has been very difficult operationally because the two clearing banks that manage the triparty repo system have a limited ability to perform this monitoring function on our behalf  in addition i would point out that the added risks from this change are very small  if securities were downgraded the primary dealer would have to substitute new eligible collateral also it should be pointed out that the pdcf accepts most investmentgrade securitiesthus we already have a broader collateral regime in place for our other primary dealer facility
chairman bernanke  thank you  lets have questions for bill on financial
markets and then we will come back to a full discussion of the proposed actions  questions for
bill  no questions  that is unusual  yes president lacker
mr lacker  about consumerloanbacked securities spreads have widened and
delinquencies and defaults have increased but not out of line with past experience  you seem to
have inferred that spreads have widened more than is warranted by the return on those securities
i would be interested in what computational exercises or what other analytics you and your staff
have undertaken to document the hypothesis that these spreads are not warranted by the
fundamentals
mr dudley  i am not so much saying that they are not warranted  i am saying that
the spreads have widened a lot relative to the actual experience given that we are in a period of
weaker economic growth  the stress seems to be more on the spreads that the market is
demanding for these assets as opposed to a deterioration in the underlying credit card loans or
auto loans that back those assets
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not let me just say a word or two about
the proposed liquidity measures  first as bill noted the interbank and shortterm funding
markets remain under some stress  in particular as you know from the picture the spreads in the
dollar interbank market have gone above the uk and ecb markets  although it is certainly
difficult to identify precisely the size and the significance of the effect of our liquidity facilities
not just the banks and the market participants have been in favor of them  we have received
very good reviews from international agencies such as the imf the oecd and others and i do
think that it is worth continuing these efforts to try to strengthen liquidity availability
therefore with respect to interbank markets first as mentioned i propose to use my
delegated authority to increase the size of the term auction facility  second i would like to ask
the fomc to approve increases in our swap lines and an extension of the duration of the swap
lines with the european central bank and the swiss national bank  as now they would be
auctioning money at the same time that we do in our taf  the swaps with canada and mexico
are routine  we have done these for a number of years  as i promised you at an earlier meeting
i checked with the treasury and they are all in favor of maintaining these facilities  i think it
would be rather odd to end them at this particular juncture so i ask for renewal of those swap
lines as well
on the tslf the auctions that we have had have been undersubscribed which may be
good news  on the other hand it may have something to do with narrowness of the collateral
that is accepted  the tslf is intended to help the functioning of the treasury market because it
puts more treasuries into circulation  we do have some evidence that treasuries are trading at
lower spreads and with less volatility since we began these activities  in addition there is some
support for the collateral that is taken and general liquidity support for the market although
again it is really both sides of this equation that we are looking at  the current collateral that is
accepted at the tslf is basically rmbs and cmbs  the proposal is to increase the range of
collateral to include aaa assetbacked securities which include credit cards auto loans and
student loansbasically mostly consumeroriented credit  i think it makes a lot of sense in the
context of what we have been doing  it would make the range of collateral more similar to that
in our other facilities  it also would reduce the credit allocation aspects by broadening the range
of collateral that we accept  on the other hand as bill mentioned unless the situation becomes
radically different we probably dont want to extend beyond this because of difficulties in
assessing the credit quality of other assets
i put this item on the meeting agenda for your discussion because there are some political
and public relations complications and i wanted just to be up front and let you know what they
are and get your response and your views  as you know the student loan market has been
dysfunctional and we have received requestsperhaps you have as wellto do something
about this problem  we received letters probably about a month ago from some house
members including congressman kanjorski who asked us to extend our lending authority
beyond the current institutions to others  i assume sallie mae for example would have been a
possibility  we wrote back a very clear letter saying that we could not do that that our 133
authority was reserved for unusual and exigent circumstances which we interpreted as being
systemically relevant circumstances that the bar was very high for the use of that authority and
that although we certainly want to strengthen the liquidity in the general markets we didnt see
this as being a possibility
we received a second set of letters a couple of weeks ago really one letter signed by a
number of senators mostly from the senate banking committee asking specifically that we
expand the collateral in the tslf to include student loans  now we have the problem that this
would do that along with other much more significant in terms of size consumer loans  we
wrote back to senator dodd and his colleagues last week and told them that although we of
course are always looking to improve the liquidity of markets and in particular we think student
loans are a very worthy type of credit we didnt see the argument  first student loans are
already accepted as collateral in our other three facilitiesthe taf the window and the pdcf
second we argued that the real problem with the student loan situation is on the legislative side
in particular recent legislative changes have reduced the spreads that privatesector lenders can
get from student loans  given the increase in funding costs they have become unprofitable and
so many lenders have withdrawn from that market  so we didnt give any encouragement in that
letter
that being said if we take this actionwhich was suggested by the staff and which is i
believe fully justified on its own meritsit would be part of a broader package and i think we
would get two different reactions  on the one hand we would get i would call it for short a
wall street journal editorial that the federal reserve is once again the craven cur and the
spinelessboy i am getting good at thislaughter lackey of the congress by accommodating
this request  i take that seriously  im sure we all take seriously even the perception that we are
catering to this request  on the other side i suppose that there would be what i could call the
usa today editorial which is why wont the fed which is bailing out wall street left and
right include assetbacked paper in their facilities even though it is consistent with all of their
other practices and they take it in all of their other facilities and so on  so i think there are pr
and political risks on both sides of this  i am not going to try to downplay those but i do think
that on the substance this is a good move and i will just put this on the table for your questions
or comments  if a significant number of members of the committee are uncomfortable with
proceedingand what we would do if we proceed is to put this all together in a package to be
announced with the europeans and the swiss on friday morningthen i would certainly be
willing to table this last item  so let me open the floor for any comments  president lacker
mr lacker  i think the political concern you raised and described is a very very
serious one for this institution  even if we thought of this ourselves before senator dodd and
others wrote to usand apparently it is true that we didwe are never going to be able to
convince a broad array of observers that this was not a direct response to a senatorial request
given that i think the perception that we included this and maybe added some other securities as
a fig leaf sets just a disastrous precedent  it would be the use of our balance sheet to circumvent
the checks and balances of the constitutional process for legislating about fiscal matters  i think
that the integrity of our independence as an institution relies to a substantial degree on our lack
of entanglement or our distance from the political fray
i would also question the value of this on the substance  what we are doing with the
tslf as bills chart showed looks as though it has had a big effect on the gc repo rate  it is
hard to see how some additional amount of treasuries in the market given the size of the
treasury market is going to have a gigantic effect  it is also hard to see that there is much strain
or dislocation caused by the most recent observation in his graph on the gap between the funds
rate and the gc repo ratewhich is actually what like 10 or 20 basis points or about what it has
historically been  so i would question whether we really need this on the substance as well
on the other measures the taf is dominated by european institutions  term funding
spreads seem dominated by the term funding demands of european institutions  i dont see why
we dont try to shift to european institutions the public policy responsibility for managing those
situations  we already have an apparently wellfunctioning mechanism for supplying dollar
balances to foreign official institutions to allow them to do that  i dont see why we dont limit
our expansion of funding in that directionto the swap linesrather than expanding the taf
thank you
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  a questionand just remind meif we bring the student loans and
these other assets in under this facility do we have the right to swap out if the rating changes or
questions come up
mr dudley  yes  they are priced every day and if they are downgraded there will
be an automatic substitution  so you are protected both on price and on the ability to substitute
mr hoenig  that was my first question  the second is that we have been entangled
before in appearance issues  if we feel that we are doing the right thing that doesnt give me
much concern  on the substance do you judge that the tightness in the market is such that this
action is necessary to facilitate liquidity or will this only marginally improve things  if it is
marginal the appearance issue becomes more entangled i think  if it is pretty clear that we have
some liquidity issues and that this will address them then i would feel much more comfortable
with it
mr dudley  well i think the honest answer is that we dont really know exactly
where it is on the continuum of very modest to substantive  one thing we can say is that this
should increase the demand at the tslf auction so it should increase the likelihood that more of
the treasuries are actually put into the market in exchange for such collateral because we are
broadening the eligible collateral  but i dont think the notion that this is a panacea is true
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i want to say just one thing in this context  the
chairman alluded to this too  i think there is some value in taking this opportunity now to try to
get a better balance in the relative attractiveness across these facilities  so in the scheme of
things it is better for us for the auction type of facilities to be relatively attractive compared with
the open facilities for which demand is unknown and we cant calibrate itthose are much
bigger reservemanagement things  i think our exit strategy from these things is easier if we
evolve in that direction  one virtue of the package that the chairman presented is that it is worth
taking another shot at trying to get those interbank term premiums down in dollars becauseto
use a technical termthey are screwing up the transmission mechanism of us monetary policy
now  we are not quite sure how much effect we can have  there is a plausible case that
increasing the size of the swaps will help on that front  it is worth doing now  second the
broader package will buy a little more insurance against the risk that these liquidity pressures
reignite and we have another wave of the adverse dynamic marginspiraldownwardselffeeding
thing  it is better to do that when other things are improving rather than wait until we are again
at the edge of the abyss although that is a tactical judgment  it is hard to know for sure
i think that bill is absolutely right  it is not clear how much incremental benefit the
expanded collateral in the tslf will offer  we cant be sure  but jeff it wont come because
we are increasing the size of the tslf  that would increase the amount of treasuries we are
putting in and we are not increasing the size  it would come only through what effect it might
have on the broader range of assetbacked securities we have there  remember at the beginning
we framed this as an effort to address some unique constraints operating on securitization
markets particularly in abs  so there is a possibility of some additional benefit in those
marketssome greater insurance against another downward spiral in that casebut not that
high  it is hard to judge the merits of that against the appearance risk you presented but i think
this is designed pretty carefully to be robust to that perception problem  our job is to do what
makes sense and what we can defend as sensible in this context and we have to be prepared to
do that even if people have made it awkward for us to do the right thing because of the
perception problem
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  well i certainly agree with the last statement that we should do
what makes sense and in this case differentiating between kinds of collateral that are all aaa
doesnt make sense to me  we should broaden it out  i would say that in your presentation you
didnt have the assetbacked commercial paper market but those rates actually have been quite
elevated  some rollovers for some of the large banks have not been working all that well and
the assets that tend to be in those conduits are the very assets we are talking about expanding
they are the student loans the auto loans and the various other things that go into these
conduits  so i dont know how big an effect it would be but if you look at the assetbacked
commercial paper rates they would look a lot like the libor rates  i think that there might be
some net benefit and it certainly does make sense to me that we would expand  there is no
reason to differentiate among aaa collateral that has many similar attributes
chairman bernanke  president lacker a twohanded comment
mr lacker  yes  mr chairman you motivated the expansion of the term securities
lending facility by the effect it would have by increasing the amount of treasuries in the market
vice chairman geithner you appealed to the effect it would have on the assetbacked securities
that would be offered on the market  we didnt discuss the assetbacked securities market
except that i had this exchange with our manager  i am not aware of any evidence that there is
something wrong with the fundamentals of those markets  now admittedly it is not clear that
many of our arguments for some of these facilities have been based on some careful diagnosis of
fundamentals  if this is about those assetbacked securities markets that is another thing
entirely  i was a little confused about that and wondered about the rationale
chairman bernanke  i may have misspoken but i think i had in mind both sides
of the equation  the treasuries have certainly responded  its harder to judge on the asset side
but i guess that the premise is the samethat all of these markets are suffering from withdrawal
of the normal liquidity provision of money market mutual funds and other less sophisticated
investors  banks and others are finding it hard to finance those assets and thats the liquidity
backstop that we provide  so i think on both sides
mr dudley  if i may come back to the issue of the aaa securities and the spreads
those are aaarated securities for which the spread has widened hundreds of basis points  if the
loss experienced is not unusual relative to the cycle then its hard to understand why aaarated
securities would be selling at several hundred basis points over treasuries  it is impossible to
square that circle
chairman bernanke  yes
mr lacker  if the payoff for those securities is unexpectedly low it is likely to
happen in a circumstance in which the economy is doing awfully poorly  risk premiums are
about variances and risk aversion but they are also about correlation with aggregate states
arguably that would rationalize a widening of the risk premiums attached to a wide range of
securities mortgagebacked included  we have yet to see any evidence from our staff refuting
that interpretation of the widening spreads we have seen  mr chairman with all due respect
what you describe is a lack of demand  i am not sure how that squares with viewing the market
as somehow malfunctioning
chairman bernanke  well we have seen the breakdown of a particular structure
of lending that was based on the credit ratings  the credit ratings have proven to be false
therefore there is an informational deficitan asymmetric information problem would be my
interpretationwhich has in turn triggered a massive change in preferences  but i dont think
we are going to settle this at the table here  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  the question that i have gets to the
appearance issue and it is not really about the immediate concerns  to the extent that the
markets are not functioning that well this could be useful and so i dont really have any
disagreement with that  but the facilities that we are talking about currently have a temporary
nature to them  the term auction facility is temporary although of course the board could make
it permanent  the term securities lending facility is an expansion of a program  whats the
permanence of that and the primary dealer credit facility as well  as we allow other forms of
collateral to be taken what implications might that have for the future if we try to make these
more permanent  this is simply a question i dont know what the answer is  do we feel
comfortable with these forms of additional collateral on a permanent ongoing basis if we were
to do that or do we think it would be possible to turn that off  how costly would it be
chairman bernanke  the tslf and the pdcf are emergency measures and
barring congressional action we cannot maintain them  presumably they will be phased out as
markets improve  if we are doing these things i dont see the argument for one set of collateral
versus another  president fisher
mr fisher  along those lines mr chairman i viewed these facilities as a liquidity
bridge an aqueduct to getting over this credit crunch that we have had  i am not as concerned
about having this facility accept the same collateral as the other facilities  i do have a question
about the permanence and it is a different kind of question which is whether or not the congress
will encourage us to make these permanent  i think that is a risk and we need to think about it  i
dont have an answer  i have been on the receiving end as you may know of enormous pressure
from the texas delegation on the student loan business and we have talked about it with the staff
quite a bit  i quoted you in my response by the way in your first series of letters  it doesnt
bother me to have egg on my face if we are doing the right thingagain having the same
collateral regime as we have for our other facilities  i am more worried however about whether
it encourages them in interfering with the temporary nature of these facilities  that is just one
point to think about  i have a question about the tafjust to make sure that i understand  we
are talking about taking it to 150 billion in outstandingsis that correct
chairman bernanke  yes
mr fisher  so 75 billion auctions  okay  the third point which is about optics is a
little different  i dont know what were going to come out with in terms of policy  i know what
my preferences are and i sense what some other peoples preferences are  im a little concerned
that we have to be able to express this in a way that doesnt look as though we see something that
no one else sees  so we need to think about that and the way we articulate it  the last time we
had a disconnect between an action on the fed funds rate and agreeing to something and
announcing it internationally it didnt really work well  they read more into it than was there
we all understood why we were having that time disconnectit was because we needed to line
up our ducks with our foreign counterparts  maybe we should think about that as wellwhether
we should move it up to the same time that we announce the action of this committee on the fed
funds rate  i dont know if that is physically possible  but i wouldnt want in any way to convey
that we see something that other people dont see that there is a problem in these particular
markets  everybody knows that ge is trying to sell a 40 billion credit card portfolio and they
are not getting any bidders  so i can see the devious minds or the minds of those who dont
necessarily think well of us linking all these little pieces together and saying that were reacting
or overreacting to something that may not be there  i just wanted to put that on the table for you
to think about  i am not against the concept since we have already gone down this path of
making this subject to the same collateral regime  but i do thinkand i am glad you raised the
subjectthat though i have interpreted it differently we have to be concerned about the optics
here
chairman bernanke  president fisher the timing is dictated by the preference of
the europeans not to be tied into our monetary policy decision and the fact that thursday is a
european holiday  the problem you were alluding to earlier had to do with the very strong
market expectation that we were going to act on liquidity measures  we disappointed both on
that and on the rate  that was why we got the strong reaction and theres no such expectation to
my knowledge here  at the same time our press release which we have already looked at in
draft and market expectations are very focused on the libor issue and the interbank issue
given that we have done so many steps in this direction i dont think that this would be
misinterpreted as anything particularly overdramatic
mr fisher  mr chairman may i just raise one other point  i think president lacker
touched on this  i am concerned in terms of the eventual optics about the fact that the taf is
being drawn on predominately by foreign banks  my numbers here are that the last one was
78 percent foreign bank participation and the previous one was 91 percent  i think there we may
have some political vulnerability  again i just put it on the table for us to consider  i am almost
more worried about a backlash on that eventually than what we are talking about currently
chairman bernanke  the problem is that european banks are structurally
deficient in dollars and they have a time zone shift  it is a dollar market
mr fisher  it has been well presented  its hard to explain to a politician  thats my
point
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  on the last point i think it is helpful to expand
both the swaps and the taf at the same time  people understand that there are pressures in these
funding markets and we can address them both at home and abroad  they do feed back on our
market so i guess i am not too worried about that one  also it is quite logical to do the swaps
and the taf  i dont see any issue
on the tslf i have been thinking about it less on the treasury side than on the other
side  i dont think the tslf will increase the demand for holding these securities in any major
direct way  my hope is that sort of around the margin it would make dealers more willing to
make markets in them and to be on both sides of the market including the buy side from time to
time because then they would see that they had a place to finance those securities if at the end
of the day they had more  so if it helps it will help the liquidity of those markets rather than
increasing the ultimate demand for the securities  i think it is an indirect thing  my guess is that
it might help at most around the margins  i dont see how it can hurt  there is a certain logic to
it  i dont think it will help the student loans at all  the structural issues are just overwhelming
any of the other issues in that line  if somebody asked you mr chairman whether this was
aimed at student loans i think you could say that they just were along for the ride in the sense
that they were part of the aaa abs market and that we didnt have any expectation that
expanding that market would help them  thank you
chairman bernanke  okay  president bullard
mr bullard  i am the new guy but i will just put in my two cents here  everyone
seems to agree that there is no quantitative impact  i cant see any quantitative impact  there
are political implications  i dont see why we are doing it
chairman bernanke  to repeat what bill said i think it is hard to measure the
quantitative impact but my guess is that there is some  but the point is well taken  what i
would like to do is go through the first votes and then we will take a straw vote on the tslf
and then decide what to do  okay  first we have to ratify domestic open market operations
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  no objection  okay  now the swap agreements with
canada and mexico
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  is there anyone who wants a roll call on this  okay  if not
then no objection  extend and expand the swap agreement with the ecb
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  is there anyone who wants a roll call on this  okay  then
without objection  expand and extend the swap agreement with the swiss national bank
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  okay  now on the tslf the proposal
is to include this as part of the package  there will be no change to the facility except for the
increase in the collateral range to include aaa assetbacked securities  are there any further
comments on this  i am going to ask for a straw vote just to get a sense  abstentions are fine
if there are no further comments how many people are in favor of this  i see 10 i think
ms yellen  are you asking voters only
chairman bernanke  im sorry
mr fisher  are you asking voters only or the entire table
chairman bernanke  i would like to get a sense of all participants if that is okay
thirteen participants are in favor  all right  all participants against  okay  lets go ahead and
take a vote on this then  is there anyone who wants a roll call vote  if not then no objection
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  no objection  thank you  lets turn now to the economic
situation  dave stockton
mr stockton  nathan and i thought that we would alter slightly the structure of our briefing today so as to focus a bit more closely than usual on the global and domestic outlooks for inflation  ill start with a brief review of recent economic developments and our outlook for economic activity in the united states  nathan will then discuss trade and foreign activity before turning to global commodity markets and our forecast for import prices  i will then explain how both foreign and domestic influences are shaping our outlook for us inflation  brian will conclude by presenting your forecasts
let me turn first to the domestic economy  from a forecasting perspective this intermeeting period turned out to be reasonably tranquil at least by the standards of the past nine months  the incoming data were very close to our expectations and required few adjustments to either topline gdp or to the individual components of spending  as we noted in the greenbook we continue to think it likely that the economy is in recession and with the data evolving pretty much as we had expected we have seen little reason to back away from that call
readings from the labor market support the view that at the very least a pronounced deceleration in aggregate activity is under way  private payrolls fell about 100000 in march the third consecutive month with a drop of that magnitude and the unemployment rate moved above 5 percent  moreover a notable weakening of labor markets is signaled by most of the indicators that we monitor  surveys of hiring plans have continued to move lower there are fewer job vacancies businesses report that jobs are easier to fill and household attitudes have continued to sour including their views of the labor market  in the past such a configuration of readings has been a reasonably reliable indicator of cyclical downturn
the spending data also have been consistent with our forecast of a marked weakening in aggregate demand and activity  after posting modest gains last year consumer outlays and business equipment spending appear to have been at a near standstill since the turn of the year  meanwhile housing continues its steep descent and looks to be on track to subtract about 1 percentage points from the growth of real gdp in the first half of the yearclose to our march projection  moreover while we had anticipated a sharp deceleration in nonresidential construction in response to moredifficult financing conditions that sector now appears to be turning down earlier and more sharply than we had projected  finally much as we had been expecting weak domestic demand is receiving some offset from ongoing solid gains in exports
all told we estimate that real gdp rose at an annual rate of  percent in the first quarter just a few tenths above our march forecast  as you know tomorrow morning the bea will release its advance gdp estimate for the first quarter  for the second quarter we are projecting real output to decline at a 1 percent annual rate a few tenths weaker than our march forecast  on net the outlook for activity in the first half is basically unchanged from the time of the last meeting  looking further ahead our mediumterm forecast also hasnt changed much over the past six weeks the stock market is more than 5 percent higher than we had anticipated  but the favorable effects of that development on activity are nearly offset by the adverse effects of lower house prices and higher oil prices consequently the gdp gap at the end of next year is unchanged from the march forecast
our basic story remains the same  the contraction in activity that we are projecting over the first half of the year is expected to be relatively mild because of the boost to spending and activity from the tax rebates and because export demand remains solid  in the second half real gdp turns up but i wouldnt really term this a recovery  after all real gdp is projected to grow less than 1 percent at an annual rate employment continues to decline and the unemployment rate runs up to
5 percent  but we see a number of factors fostering a more noticeable acceleration of activity to a pace above its potential by 2009  first the contraction in residential investment abates  second the drag on consumption growth from the rise in oil prices wanes  third financial conditions stabilize and then begin to improve gradually reducing restraint on household and business spending  finally we assume that monetary policy remains accommodative  with the growth in real gdp running 2 percent next year about  percentage point above the pace of potential the unemployment rate drops slowly to 5 percent
obviously there are large risks on both sides of our projection  on the upside we could just be flatout wrong about an imminent contraction in aggregate activity
claims were running about 360000 at the time of the march fomc and are now averaging about 370000  while that increase suggests some further softening in the labor market the level of claims seems lower than would comfortably fit our forecast of payroll employment declines averaging about 160000 over the next few months likewise industrial production has weakened but hasnt dropped off much  because
we dont expect manufacturing to be at the epicenter of this business cycle we arent looking for a plunge but we are forecasting more noticeable declines than weve seen to date  in addition although last weeks numbers for shipments of nondefense capital goods in march were close to our forecast the orders figures were firmer than we had expected  in sum while the data have not pushed us away from our recession forecast they havent convincingly confirmed it yet either
more broadly with bond spreads down the stock market up and market expectations for the path of policy revised higher the situation certainly looks less menacing than at the time of the march meeting  but while we would agree that the risk of a very bad tail event seems to have declined we are not ready to join others in heaving a sigh of relief just yet about the modal outlook  for one we still see no signs of a bottom in housing  new homes saleswe received the numbers after the projection was completeddeclined more than 8 percent last month to a level that we thought would be the bottom in the second half of this year  a second concern centers on consumption  with oil prices running around 115 per barrel consumers will be facing sizable further increases in gasoline prices over the next few months from already elevated levels  also given the steep declines in employment that we are projecting incomes and income uncertainty will be taking a hit  weve taken those factors on board as best we can and we are counting on the tax rebates to provide a powerful offset but we cant rule out a more adverse reaction to what will be an accumulation of bad news  furthermore while there has been improvement in the general tenor of financial markets i suspect that weve only begun to see the effects of tighter credit conditions on borrowing and spending  that restraint could prove larger and more persistent than is implicit in our baseline forecast  finally the mild downturn in activity that we are projecting also suggests some downside risk
our projected rise in the unemployment rate of 1 percentage points from its low point last year to its high point at the end of this year is smallsmaller than occurred in either the 199091 recession or the 2001 recession  this time could be different but as i noted in march that argument should always give you pause  nathan will now continue our presentation
mr sheets  much as dave just described for the domestic economy our forecast for economic activity abroad also is little changed from the last greenbook recent data have come in consistent with our view that the slowdown in us activity and the ongoing financial turbulence will leave an unmistakable imprint on economic growth abroad  but the extent of this imprint appears to be somewhat less pronounced than was the case in the hightechled recession earlier this decade particularly for the emerging market economies  thus we continue to see foreign growth stepping down from last years 4 percent pace to near 2 percent during the second and third quarters of this year as foreign activity is constrained by the weakening us economy and headwinds from the ongoing financial turmoil  with these factors projected to abate we see growth abroad rising back to near its trend rate of around 3 percent in 2009
suffice it to say the risks around this forecast remain significant  on the upside chinas surprisingly strong firstquarter gdp growthwhich we estimate was nearly 11 percent at an annual ratehighlights the possibility that growth in emerging asia and perhaps elsewhere as well may remain more resilient than we anticipate  on the downside the softerthanexpected german ifo data last week and the negative tone of the bank of englands recent credit conditions survey suggest that growth in europe may slow more than we now project
the exchange value of the dollar after falling sharply in the month before the march fomc meeting has rebounded somewhat during the intermeeting period against the major currencies the dollar is up almost 2 percent with a particularly sizable gain against the yen  going forward we continue to see the broad real dollar depreciating at a 3 percent pace reflecting downward pressures associated with the large albeit narrowing current account deficit  this depreciation is expected to come largely against emerging market currencies including the chinese renminbi which have moved less since the dollars peak in early 2002
turning to the us external sector we now see the arithmetic contribution from net exports to firstquarter us real gdp growth as likely to be around
03 percentage point down a few tenths from the last greenbook  recent readings on exports have continued to point to strength but imports in february bounced back from their december and january weakness more vigorously than we had expected for 2008 as a whole we continue to believe that the demand for imports will be significantly restrained by the weak pace of us activity and to a lesser extent by the depreciation of the dollar and rising prices for imported commodities  we thus see imports contracting nearly 2 percent this year  in contrast exports are expected to post 7 percent growth this year supported by the weaker dollar  the projected contraction of imports coupled with stillstrong export growth suggests that net exports will contribute nearly 1 percentage points to us gdp growth this year the largest positive contribution from net exports to annual growth in more than 25 years  in 2009 import growth is expected to bounce back to around 4 percent as the
us economy recovers and the positive contribution from net exports should accordingly decline to just under  percentage point
oil prices have continued their apparently relentless march upward with spot wti now trading at 115 per barrel  since your last meeting the spot price of wti has increased 6 per barrel and the farfutures price has moved up almost 5 per barrel  over the past year spot oil prices have risen a staggering 80 percent  while the high level of oil prices appears to be taking a bite out of oil demand in the united states and other industrial countries the demand for oil in the emerging market economiesparticularly in china and indiahas been supported by the resilience of gdp growth there  in addition fuel subsidies in some countries including india have sheltered consumers from the effects of higher oil prices  in line with these observations indias stateowned oil company recently released projections indicating that oil demand in the country will increase 8 to 10 percent this year
the supplyside response to the rising demand for oil has been only tepid  stated bluntly opec remains unwillingor unableto increase its supply to the market indeed opec has actually cut its production over the past two years  in addition oil production in the oecd countries has been on a downward trajectory primarily reflecting the decline in the north sea fields and in mexicos giant cantarell field
mexicos stateowned oil company recently indicated that for the sixth consecutive year additions to its reserves had failed to keep pace with production  the grim outlook for mexicos oil industry has prompted the government to consider allowing foreign investment in the countrys energy sector a move that would require constitutional reform  finally although the potential supply from nonoecd non opec countries is substantial production continues to be hampered by inadequate infrastructure and by uncertainties about property rights and the stability of tax regimes  in the absence of any better approach we continue to base our forecast on quotes from futures markets which see oil prices as likely to remain highat or above 110 per barrelthrough the end of the forecast period  but the confidence bands around this forecast are exceptionally wide given uncertainties surrounding the outlook for oil supply and demand
nonfuel commodity prices have also been on a wild ride of late  the prices of many of these commodities increased particularly sharply in january and february before peaking in early march  on balance our index of nonfuel commodity prices rose at a hefty annual rate of 50 percent during the first quarter  we project a further 13 percent rise in the second quarter butagain in line with quotes from futures marketswe see these prices flattening out thereafter  the underlying drivers of the sustained runup in the prices of nonfuel commodities have been broadly similar to those for oilsharp increases in demand particularly from emergingmarket economies coupled with typically lagging and often muted supply responses
notably however moves in nonfuel commodity prices since the march fomc meeting have been quite varied  for example copper and aluminum prices are up whereas nickel and zinc prices are down  for foods corn rice and soybean prices have risen while wheat prices have declined substantially
the overall strength of commodity prices continues to put upward pressure on inflation in many countries and to complicate life for central banks  notably in the euro area 12month headline inflation in march rose further to 36 percent well above the ecbs 2 percent ceiling  in the united kingdom inflation pressures stemming from rising utility gasoline and food prices are likely to push inflation toward 3 percent during the summer raising the risk that mervyn king will be required to write another letter to the chancellor of the exchequer explaining why inflation has deviated from the 2 percent target  concerns about the inflation outlook have limited the willingness of both the ecb and the bank of england to cut policy rates to address slowing growth  perhaps even more striking faced with upward pressures on inflation from rising food and energy prices coupled with stillsolid economic growth central banks in a broad array of emerging market economies tightened policy over the intermeeting period  this group included china singapore india brazil russia poland hungary and south africa  in addition some countries
have recently responded to social unrest and other strains brought on by higher food prices by restricting exports of foodstuffs particularly rice and this has exacerbated upward pressure on the global prices of these commodities
the runup in commodity prices coupled with the weaker dollar has pushed up
us core import price inflation of late  core import prices are now estimated to have increased at a 7 percent annual rate in the first quarter more than twice the pace of increase in the second half of last year  prices of materialintensive imports including industrial supplies and foods are seen to have surged at a surprisingly rapid pace of 20 percent in the first quarter on the back of the rapid rise in commodity prices  prices of imported finished goods including consumer goods capital goods and autos are estimated to have risen at a comparatively muted rate of 3 percent but this also was up sharply compared with recent quarters  the acceleration in finished goods prices seems well explained by recent moves in the dollar however and does not suggest any notable increase in the extent of exchange rate passthrough  going forward we see core import price inflation remaining elevated in the second quarter at around 6 percent  thereafter core import price inflation should abate given the projected flattening out of commodity prices and the slower pace of dollar depreciation
mr stockton  before explaining how the global developments that nathan just described intersect with our domestic inflation forecast i should briefly review some of the incoming information on prices  for the most part the recent consumer price data have been running below our expectations  at the time of the march greenbook we were estimating that core pce prices had increased at an annual rate of 2 percent in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year we now are projecting increases of 2 percent and 2 percent in the fourth and first quarters respectively  although we are estimating that core pce prices rose 02 percent in marchjust a couple of basis points below our previous forecastthere were noticeable downward revisions to the data stretching back to late last year principally for medical services and nonmarket prices
just as we had discounted some of the earlier elevated increases in core pce prices we are now inclined to discount the recent more favorable readings  the small increases in medical service prices are not likely to persist  moreover some of the recent slowdown is attributable to nonmarket prices which we view as both noisy and meanreverting  still we dont think all of the good news on core pce prices of late should be written off and all else being equal we would have taken down our forecast for the year as a whole in response to the incoming data  but of course all else was not equal  as nathan has noted there has been another sizable increase in crude oil prices the prices of nonoil imports have increased more rapidly than we had expected and more broadly both imported and domestically produced materials prices have risen sharply thus far this year  in reaction we have marked up our forecast for core pce inflation for the remainder of the year and that upward revision basically offsets the effects of the recent good news
for now inflation this year looks likely to repeat the pattern of the past four  years  since 2004 headline pce prices have risen at about 3 percent per year and core prices have been up at a rate of about 2 percent  due to a further steep rise in energy prices large gains in import prices and another abovetrend increase in food prices we are projecting headline pce prices to rise 3 percent this year and core prices to increase 2 percentsimilar to the averages over the preceding four years moreover our forecast for 2009 bears a striking resemblance to the outyear forecasts that we have continued to make over the past four years  by now in answer to the question of why inflation is expected to slow in the forecast most of you could easily recite the staffs catechism of disinflation  based on readings from the futures markets we expect consumer energy prices to flatten out next year and food prices to slow to a rate close to core inflation  with the dollar not expected to fall as much as it has over the past year and other commodity prices expected to move sideways import prices are projected to slow  those more favorable developments in combination with a noticeable increase in projected slack cause headline inflation in 2009 to slow to 1 percent and core pce inflation to edge back to 2 percent  both of those figures are 01 percentage point higher than our march forecasts reflecting the indirect effects of higher prices for energy and other imports  as we have noted many times a key element in our projection is the assumption that oil and nonoil commodity prices will flatten out as suggested by the futures markets  to put it mildly that has not been a winning forecast strategy in recent years but im not sure that we have a superior one to offer you
obviously there are some big upside and downside risks to our forecast of domestic inflation  nathan has already covered some of those related to prices for oil and other imports so let me say a few words about the outlook for retail food prices our outlook for food prices remains relatively sanguine but there would appear to be more pronounced risks to the upside than the downside  although most of the value of whats in your morning cereal bowl is advertising packaging and transportation some corn and wheat are in there also laughter and those prices have been rising rapidly  futures markets are predicting a levelingout in crop prices and that expectation is built into our forecast  but worldwide stocks of grains remain tight and any serious shortfall in production could result in sharply higher prices  in that regard while the growing season here is just getting under way corn production is off to a slow start because unusually wet conditions have hampered plantings
elsewhere increasing supplies of livestock products and poultry have been a moderating influence on retail food prices in recent months  again while futures markets suggest relatively subdued prices going forward there are a few worrying signs  although cattle on feedlots have remained near record levels new placements have fallen off of late reportedly because of the higher cost of feed  in addition the portion of feedlot placements composed of females was high last fall and through the winter which points to a reduction in the size of the breeding herd this year and thus suggests some potential supply risks ahead
in recognition of the upside risks posed by both food and energy prices we included in the greenbook an alternative simulation in which oil prices climb to
150 per barrel next year and food prices continue to run at the elevated pace of the past three years  in this scenario we also assume that another year of elevated headline inflation results in a further erosion of inflation expectations of about
 percentage point  under these conditions headline pce price inflation posts another year north of 3 percent and core inflation moves a bit higher to 2 percent this year and next  it strikes me that this type of persistent upward creep to inflation which would be difficult to positively identify in real time is a more likely risk than a sudden upward surge in price inflation
there are however some downside risks to the inflation outlook as well  as you know we upped our price forecast a bit in the last round because we saw the incoming readings on inflation expectations as suggesting that there had been some modest upward movement over the preceding few months  some of that increase may have resulted from your aggressive easing of policy early this year  but going forward the situation may be turned around  if our forecast over the next few quarters is in the right ballpark and on our assumption that the easing of policy is coming to an end you will be standing pat on policy even as payroll employment falls throughout the remainder of the year the unemployment rate trends higher and headline inflation begins to back down  it doesnt seem a stretch to me that in that environment inflation expectations could come down somewhat a development not embodied in the baseline forecast
more broadly one place that inflation expectations might be expected to manifest themselves in a way that would be most damaging to inflation would be in labor compensation  despite the elevated headline inflation of the past four years there is little evidence of any noticeable stepup in wage inflation  if that was the case when the unemployment rate was 4 percent it seems less likely that larger nominal wage gains will be secured when the unemployment rate rises to 5 percent  indeed increases in hourly labor compensation have been running well below our models for some time pointing to some additional downside risks to our inflation outlook  for now we see substantial risks to the inflation outlook but those risks still seem two sided to us  brian will complete our presentation
mr madigan2  i will be referring to the package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections  table 1 shows the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008 2009 and 2010  central tendencies and ranges of the projections published by the committee last february are shown in italics  regarding your monetary policy assumptions not shown about threefourths of the participants envisage a moderately to substantially higher federal funds rate by late next year than assumed in the greenbook a path perhaps similar to the one incorporated in financial market quotes  most of you conditioned your projections on a path for the federal funds rate that begins to rise either in late 2008 or sometime in 2009 in contrast to the greenbook path which remains flat through 2009  many of you were less clear whether you differed from the greenbook path

2  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2
over the near term but with a little reading between the lines it seems fair to say that most of you assumed a slightly higher funds rate over the near term
as shown in the first set of rows and first column of table 1 the central tendency of your real economic growth forecasts for 2008 has been marked down nearly 1 percentage point since january  most of you pointed to weak incoming data tight credit conditions falling house prices and rising energy prices as factors that prompted you to lower your growth expectations for this year  about half of you forecast a decline in economic activity over the first half of the year not shown with another quarter of you seeing a flat trajectory over that period  however only four of you used the word recession to describe the current state of the economy  none of you has a more negative firsthalf outlook than the greenbook  the downward revisions to your growth forecasts are roughly equal across both halves of 2008 and so the contour remains one of a rising growth rate over the year  members projections for the speed of the recovery in late 2008 exhibit considerable dispersion with some calling for a quick return to nearpotential growth supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus and others seeing a prolonged period of weakness owing partly to persisting financial headwinds  most of you appear to expect growth to return to near its trend rate in 2009 column 2 and to move slightly above trend in 2010 column 3  the greenbook forecast for real growth in 2008 is near the low end of the central tendency of fomc members projections but it is at the high end in 2009 and 2010
the second set of rows indicates that you have revised up your projections for the unemployment rate throughout the forecast period  of those of you who provided estimates of the natural rate of unemployment most expect unemployment to remain above the natural rate in 2010 with the others seeing a return to the natural rate
as shown in the third set of rows your projections for headline pce inflation in 2008 have been revised up a full percentage point largely due to the surge in the prices of energy and other commodities  incoming information has also prompted a small upward revision to your projections of core pce inflation this year the fourth set of rows  the rate of decline of core inflation in 2009 is essentially unchanged from that in the january projections presumably reflecting the offsetting effects of the higher unemployment rates in the april projections on the one hand and the lagged passthrough of this years higher food and energy prices on the other  by 2010 the prolonged period of economic slack pushes down core inflation to around the same rates that were projected in january  although the central tendencies for headline inflation the third set of rows also decline markedly over the forecast period overall inflation is projected to be about  percentage point higher next year than you anticipated in january  nonetheless by 2010 headline inflation is expected to be in essentially the same range of around 1 to 2 percent that you forecasted in january  your inflation projections for 2010 are close to their values in january but more than half of you raised your projections for the unemployment rate in 2010 significantly more than 01 percent  to the extent that the higher unemployment rate projections are viewed as implying an economy operating below its potential in 2010
outside analysts may infer that you expect inflation to edge down further beyond 2010
turning to the risks to the outlook as shown in the upper lefthand panel of exhibit 2 a large majority of you regard uncertainty about gdp growth as greater than normal  the upper righthand panel shows that most of you perceive the risks to gdp growth as weighted to the downside  correspondingly the risks to unemployment not shown are seen as weighted to the upside  you typically attributed the downside growth risks to the potential for sharper declines in house prices and persisting financial strains  overall the distributions of your views on the uncertainties and skews regarding growth are little changed from january  however as shown in the lower panels your perceptions of the risks regarding inflation have changed noticeably since january  as shown in the lower left panel only half as many participants now see the degree of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook as historically normal and twice as many see the uncertainties as larger than usual  as indicated to the right fewer see the risks to their outlook for overall inflation as balanced and more see the risks as skewed to the upside  your narratives indicate that you see the upside risks to inflation as deriving from the potential for continued increases in commodity prices further depreciation of the dollar and an upward drift in inflation expectations  that concludes our remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  are there questions for our
colleagues  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  the greenbook is aggressive and effective at
portraying the us economy as being in a mild recession  theyve overcome the statistical
evidence which often prevents us from forecasting a recession since they are mostly surprises
theres a nonlinear stepdown in the second quarter that begins this recession  so im a little
curious as to why you didnt follow this up by forecasting a jobless recovery  in the last two
recessions that has been an important element of what followed  i wonder if it is now a feature of
the great moderation business cycle  if you look at equilibrium real funds rates they tend to
bottom out during the period of most troubling joblessness in the aftermath of the recession  so if
were going to be relying on a period in which were doing something we havent done before like
buying a bit of additional inflation credibility it will be unusual  i guess my question is why you
made that choice
mr stockton  this year certainly is pretty close to a jobless year in terms of a full year
of nothing but employment declines and then fairly modest employment gains next year  but the
principal reason we didnt predict a pattern like the one we saw in the earlier part of this decade is
that we dont think were going to get the kind of productivity surprises that were such an important
feature of that recovery  as you may recall we were stunned by the extent to which even in a
period of cyclical weakening we kept getting much stronger productivity  i think it will be years
before research is actually able to shed a lot of light on why that occurred  the part of the story that
we still think was probably in play was that there had been an accumulation of technological
advances that businesses were able to draw on over this period and that led to a period in which
even as growth was picking up employment wasnt  we dont see that happening againalthough
we didnt see it happening the last time either so its possible
mr evans  thank you  thats a fair point
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  dave i have a couple of questions  one is technical and one is a little more
substantive  the technical one is that you have a very sharp decline in consumer spending on
services in the fourth quarter of this year and then not much of a recovery in the first quarter of next
year  i assume something special is going on there but i dont know what it is
mr stockton  what was going on there was probablyi dont know if it was rational
or irrationalinattention  but in looking at that over the weekend it seemed like something that
should not be considered as an analytical feature of the forecast  just in terms of the falloff in
consumption that we expect to follow from the end of the tax rebates my guess is that the
consumption folks were trying just to put it somewhere and some of it showed up in services
mr stern  services seems like the least likely spot actually
mr stockton  i think im raising the white flag here  laughter
mr stern  well sorry  the more fundamental question is that i have been trying to get
comfortable with an outlook that would have core inflation leveling off and maybe declining a bit
and thats the forecast i have  but i took your presentation which i think was certainly on the right
topic to say that the risks around the core inflation forecast seem to be symmetric at this point  is
that a fair characterization
mr stockton  i think that is a fair characterization  you know one thing that were
struggling withand i assume you are as well in giving your own views about the uncertainty and
the skewness around your forecastis whether things have changed  is the skew large enough for
us to argue that in fact the risks look unbalanced  we thought about that and about the potential
upside and downside risks   clearly as i indicated upside risks would be associated with ongoing
increases in underlying prices for oil and other commodities that would probably feed through
indirectly into core inflation over time  on the downside we have been struck with how little
upward pressure there has been on labor compensation and labor costs  now if you pinned me
down and said draw a fine line on this id probably say that given the pattern of the past few years
it would look to me as though theres probably a little more upside risk than downside risk but i
dont see that skewness as being material in the forecast
mr stern  thank you
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  nathan both you and dave expressed the frustration that i think all of us
have about relying on futures markets in terms of our forecast of lower prices  it just hasnt been
very helpful  do we know or have a sense of how opec itself forecasts  do they just look at
futures markets  second to what degree do you impute into your own calculations the income
elasticity of demand for the rapidly growing countries such as china  we know it is above 1 on oil
third linking the two to what degree would say the saudi royal family or the alsabahs of kuwait
be thinking about those high income elasticities of demand with those high growth rates offsetting
what used to be their fear of a slowdown in their markets  in 1978 for example they had only
three markets to sell into really  the united states japan and what we used to call western europe
now they have hedges against the weaknesses in those markets  so im wondering as we think
about alternative ways to wrap our arms around thisand it is a very difficult thing as the current
indicator we have has been shifting all over the place and has not been very usefulhave we tried
to learn how the swing producers look at this and how they calculate and think about where prices
are likely to go or whether they just look at the futures markets as well
mr sheets  it is quite frankly pretty tough to get a straight and compelling answer out
of the opec folks about how they think about the oil markets  a number of us have sat in
international meetings and listened to various explanations  in fact at one recent meeting in basel
the representative from saudi arabia indicated that opec was not prepared to supply any more oil
to the market because the market was already well supplied at the equilibrium price  it is really
quite frustrating  now what they say in these meetings is that their analysis of supplyanddemand
fundamentals would suggest a price of 70 a barrel 80 a barrel or something like that  then they
blame the residual on speculators and so on and we spend a fair amount of time looking for such
speculative effects in these oil prices and we wouldnt want to rule anything out  i mean from
what weve seen there may be an explanation out there that eludes us but there are a number of
things that we would expect to see if it were speculationfor instance runups in inventoriesthat
we dont see  we have also looked at the behavior of noncommercial traders and it does not seem
as though the noncommercial traders are actually predicting prices  quite the oppositethey seem
to be chasing the price which is quite different from what we would have expected  most recently
in a statement just this week opecs president linked the runup in oil prices to the depreciation of
the dollar and indicated that for every 1 percent decline in the dollar oil prices would rise 400 a
barrel which strikes us as being just absolutely extraordinary  we can see 1 percent on the dollar
moving oil prices 1 percent but to get a coefficient beyond that just seemsi dont want to say
economically impossible but id like to see the model that generates it  now about how they
actually talk about oil prices behind closed doors i dont have any additional insight to provide
other than what ive heard them say in some of these international meetings
certainly in our analysis we try to think through the outlook for demand from countries like
china and india  in fact quite regularly we do a fullblown supplyanddemand balance exercise in
which we say here is the price  what kind of supplyanddemand fundamentals would be
necessary to deliver that price  we use the iea the eia and others as input but we actually do
our own separate analyses  we try to think very granularly about the demand from these emerging
market countries and the implications that that has on the price
as to the last part of your question i think certainly its true at least until recently that there
was a sense on the part of opec that if they allowed the price to stay too high for too long there
would be a significant supply response that would end up driving the price back down  now the
fact that they seem quite comfortable to live with the price of 115 or 120 a barrel suggests to me
that maybe they have come to the conclusion that there is just more demand out there and in some
sense they are going to ride the wave of this increasing demand in some of these emerging market
economies  that said the prices have risen a lot  theyre up 75 percent or 80 percent over the past
year  a year ago im sure that thats not what my predecessor was forecasting and its hard for me
to imagine that were going to see oil at 200 a barrel  nevertheless given the income and price
elasticities of this thing our view is that 1 percent greater global demand thats not met by supply
could very well push prices up at least 10 percent  it isnt going to take a whole lot of surprise on
global demand to have a significant impact on prices  as i said i think that opec is aware of that
and is willing to run the risk that there may be at some point a large supply response that could put
significant downward pressure on the price of oil
mr fisher  thank you for that long and thoughtful answer
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i have two questions  one in comparing the
staffs forecast with a lot of the privatesector forecastswhat it looks like and its shapeone thing
that is striking about the forecast is the very large adjustment swing that occurs in inventories  my
interpretation is that one thing that is occurring in the way youve made adjustments to your
forecastor maybe this is more of a questionis that the spending of the tax rebates appears to be
occurring out of inventories  therefore there is no production response or less production
response to the presumably increasing demand that may materialize  can you give me some
feeling about why you chose that way of treating this
the second question goes back to inflation  i thought your discussion of the uncertainties
around inflation was excellent  part of what you talked about in the greenbook was the uncertainty
about passthroughs of commodity price increases and oil price increases into various measures of
consumer price inflation which you indicated were imprecise and which we dont really know
much about  i was struck that if there is more passthrough than the baseline says were going to
get more inflation in the near term and then disinflation will be more rapid when you assume that
commodity prices are going to come down  but if commodity prices only stabilize and dont come
down then its going to be a more complicated picture  you do have an alternative scenario that
says that commodity prices keep rising but you allow expectations to move up only fairly modestly
in the model  it seems to me that particularly if expectations become more unanchored than that
the time paths of the funds rate that are implicit in the simulations become much more aggressive on
the other side  i just want to make sure that my intuition is correct here
mr stockton  your intuition on that last point is correct  obviously in that simulation
we have inflation expectations deteriorate a little more from where we think they have deteriorated
already over the past year or so  again this is really hard to pin down but we think there has
probably been an increase of maybe  percentage point in longerterm inflation expectations over
the last couple of years in the context of this stepup in headline inflation and the higher commodity
prices that are associated with that increase  so in the simulation were basically assuming that the
process continues  if you have another year or two of high headline inflation you may get
additional deterioration of inflation expectations on the order of  percentage point  youre right
that if expectations truly became unhinged and people began to view the entire inflation process as
generating some greater upward momentum it would have implications both for inflation and
mr plosser  a lot bigger than just the rise in expectations
mr stockton  a lot bigger than just the rise in expectations and the fed funds rate of
course would have to rise considerably
on the inventory side of the forecastagain you put your finger on the principal reason that
inventories are as weak as they are in the near term which is that we think there will be a pretty
sizable spending response to the tax rebates but we dont see that as showing up fully in activity in
large measure because we think firms are going to understand that this will be a onetime increase in
demand  so they will be somewhat cautious about responding with higher production to that
demand and will especially in the context of a relatively weak economy be more content with
having that run down inventories than actually with ramping up production immediately  now
thats guesswork on our part  again i feel pretty comfortable with that basic story but it is going to
require some fairly negative inventory figures shortly  there is a technical factor here as well  we
have occasionally cited a residual seasonality in imports and in the second quarter that residual
seasonality pushes down imports a lot  but we see no residual seasonality in gdp so we take it out
of inventories  that has been a standard feature of our forecast for the past few years  nathan and
his crew have communicated quite frequently with the bea complaining about the fact that they
have a seasonal adjustment process that takes a relatively flat series and creates lots of noise
laughter  it does not seem as though it is probably the best thing but it exaggerates the downward
movement in inventories  if i had to cite something that would make me nervous about the
weakness in our nearterm outlook i do worry that the inventory liquidation in our forecast is large
the decline in the inventorysales ratio in our forecast looks a lot like the decline in the inventory
sales ratio that we saw in 2001 and 2002  so its not out of line with past cyclical behavior but its
an aggressive drop
mr plosser  in the theoretical literature there is a lot of discussion about inventory
modeling now and what the appropriate way is to think about it
mr stockton  i think i can assure you that our models of inventory investment are not
very good
chairman bernanke  but they dont take information and convert it into noise
laughter  other questions for our colleagues  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  just to follow that up dave how do you
build your assumption on the spending response to the fiscal stimulus
mr stockton  that was based on our reading of the literature especially of the last
episode of fiscal stimulus which was associated with the rebate package in the earlier part of the
decade  were assuming a marginal propensity to consume out of those rebates of about that
seems reasonably in line with what the literature suggestsand that they will be spent out over the
next few quarters  but again thats based on one or two data points  were trying to draw some
strong inferences from those data points and its our best guess at this point
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  yes just a followup  another way to ask my question is given your
assumptions about the fiscal policy stimulus and tax rebates if i took the view that your estimate of
spending was not really 50 cents 40 cents or 60 cents but really 10 centsmost of it will get saved
and not spenthow would that affect your inventory assumptions and therefore the path over the
next several quarters
mr stockton  roughly were offsetting about half the spending through the inventory
drawdown so you could basically take that  if you took away a significant fraction of the spending
wed take away a significant fraction of the inventory liquidation and the gdp effects would be
moderated considerably
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not lets start our goround  president
evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i was pleasantly surprised that we have not had
any major downside surprises since our march 18 meeting  so while i still recognize the
economys downside risks ive become less comfortable about signing onto the greenbooks
judgment that a nonlinear stepdown in activity currently is in train  on balance our projection still
looks for weakness in the near term and then has growth picking up as we move through 2008 and
into 2009  we see a noticeable output gap opening this year but not one as large as in the
greenbook  under this forecast it is possible that some portion of 2008 might eventually be labeled
a recession but it is not yet conclusive that it will be  indeed given the highly unexpected
development that events have proceeded as expected i think the downside risks to growth have
abated some  some of the stress in financial markets has been mitigated by our new lending
policies as well as actions by banks in recognizing losses and raising capital  neither the incoming
data nor the reports from my business contacts seem to be consistent with the bleak downside
scenarios that i feared might transpire after we saw the december employment report early this
year  in this regard i will simply note a couple of observations from my contacts  a national
shopping mall developer reported that his tenants experienced a small improvement in april retail
sales compared with march  he was not expecting that  similarly manpower indicated a small
improvement in billable hours for temporary workers over the past month and a half also
unexpected
now i am not saying that i will be surprised if the outlook deteriorates further  i am saying
that the likelihood of that event seems to be smaller today than i expected at our last two meetings
accordingly i think that current real interest rates are appropriately accommodative relative to the
baseline forecast for economic growth and the risk to that outlook  as seen in chart 6 of the
bluebook the real funds rate is essentially zero  of course this uses a core pce measure of
inflation and thus may overstate the true real rate since headline inflation has been consistently
running above this core measure  there is the additional accommodation that is being provided by
the range of new lending facilities we had put in place  the extra accommodation is appropriate to
offset the large degree of restraint still being exerted from financial markets and our expansion of
the swap lines and the taf adds to this accommodation  furthermore in the event of a nonlinear
stepdown in economic activity as in the greenbook forecast our policy responses can be adjusted
appropriately because were well positioned now for that
on the price side on balance the recent news has been good  my forecast has core pce
inflation falling to just under 2 percent in 2010 largely because of the increasing resource slack in
the economy  however i think there are substantial upside risks to this outlook  all of my business
contacts have noted how high and rising energy and commodity prices are creating cost pressures
that many are passing on to their customers  as dave stockton mentioned with his inflation
catechism without reviewing the past transcripts i will speculate that we have been projecting a
levelingout of energy prices since the price of oil was 70 a barrel  weak domestic demand may
limit the degree to which producers can pass through these higher costs but it is unlikely to prevent
noticeable increases in some downstream prices  the depreciation of the dollar also imposes risks
even beyond the effects operating through the commodity price channel  now i do agree that labor
costs have not been cited as a problem for inflationary pressures and so that does add somewhat to
trimming out the risks there
inflation expectations were also an issue  no matter how often we say that core inflation is
a more reliable measure of underlying inflationary tendencies i find it difficult to believe that the
publics inflationary expectations will not be affected by large and persistent increases in food and
energy prices  the past five years have been unkind on this score  on average over this time
higher food and energy prices have pushed total inflation above core about  percentage point and
it is also sizable over the past ten years  another challenge for inflationary expectations comes from
our policy focus on the downside risks to growth during a time of rising headline inflation  rightly
or not this could make the public question our attitudes toward inflation  we are accepting
considerable inflationary risks when we hope that these concerns will disappear quickly with future
adjustments to policy that have not yet been signaled  how we balance these conflicting risks
should be an important component of our discussion tomorrow  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  in the third district there has been little
change in economic activity since i reported in march  business activity remained weak over the
intermeeting period but no more or less than anticipated and than we reported in our march
meeting  manufacturing activity residential construction and employment remained modestly
weak in the district  retail sales were also sluggish
our staffs coincident indicators of economic activity which summarize our regional data
show a decline in activity in pennsylvania and delaware but moderate growth in new jersey in
march and on average for the last three months  overall our firms are not very upbeat about near
term growth and like many forecasters they have revised downward their expectations since the
start of the year  for example in response to a special question in our business outlook survey the
number of manufacturers saying that current demand for their products fell short of what they had
expected at the start of the year exceeded those who had underestimated demand  more firms have
decreased their capital spending plans with 10 percent indicating that they either delayed capital
spending or postponed it indefinitely  while growth in the district has been weak price pressures
facing our firms and consumers have intensified  area manufacturers continue to report higher
production costs and the percentage of firms raising prices on finished goods is larger than earlier in
the year  the indexes of prices paid and prices received are near 20year highs for our firms and
firms expect to see prices move higher over the next six months  these firms have a very
pessimistic outlook for inflation
turning to the national outlook i have revised down my growth forecast from what i
submitted in january as almost all of us have but that revision occurred largely between january
and march  there has been little or no change in my outlook since our march meeting  compared
with my january forecast i now see real gdp growth coming in around 15 percent for 2008 and
close to 26 to 28 percent in 200910  overall this is about  percentage point weaker for 08 than
my january forecast but there is little difference in my forecast for 09 and 10  the indicators that
have come in since our last meeting have generally been in line with my march outlook  certainly
they have pointed to continued weakness but not worse than i had expected  although some strains
in the interbank markets remain they do not appear to have intensified and our alphabet soup of
targeted tools seems to be having at least modest beneficial effect even if only psychologically
i remain concerned however about inflation and our calibration of the appropriate level of
the fed funds rate consistent with our goals  inflation readings have abated marginally since our last
meeting but as the greenbook suggests there is reason to believe that this is a temporary reprieve
and that the levels remained elevatedyearoveryear cpi inflation was 4 percent in march and
yearoveryear pce inflation was 34 percentwell above their 2007 levels  as we have been
noting oil and other commodity prices continue to move up and businesses and consumers
continue to stress inflation as a concern  nearterm measures of inflation expectations have risen
sharply  in the michigan survey oneyear inflation expectations rose to 48 percent in april up
from 43 percent in march and 34 percent in december  clearly the greater media attention on
inflation and the discussion among the public are bound to have some effect on expectations as time
goes on
i have some concerns and difficulty interpreting the measure in tips given the disruptions
in financial markets right now  so i take those with a little grain of salt  nevertheless fiveyear
fiveyearahead inflation compensation is 28 percent using the boards measure  this is down a
little from early march but is still higher than it was at the end of 2007  in fact the instability of
these measures of inflation expectations itself is a cause of concern for me  it may suggest that
markets question our willingness to take actions consistent with sustained and credible price
stability
now we have often alluded to the idea that nearterm weakness will help mitigate some of
the inflation pressures  however i would just like to remind us that this critically depends on
inflation expectations remaining well anchored  i hope that going forward we can reinforce that
conditionality of the statement about weakness helping us on the inflation side so that we do not
perpetuate the notion that a stable phillips curve is at work here and that a slowing economy will
always lower inflation  i believe that the fomcs commitment to price stability remains credible at
this time but just barely  i worry that we may be resting too much on our laurels trying to talk a
good game but unwilling to take the actions necessary to support and sustain that credibility  as i
have said before in this group we must not wait until expectations have broken out because by then
it will be too late  inflation has been well above at least our implicit goal for a sustained period  as
the bluebook points out core pce inflation has been above 2 percent since 2004 every year and is
projected to be so again this year and the projections are even worse for headline numbers either
cpi or pce  if we continue easing or maintaining a real funds rate well below zero for a sustained
period despite inflation well above our goal can we really expect inflation expectations to remain
anchored
the greenbook seems to think that we can  it assumes that the fed funds rate falls to
175 percent in june and remains there through the end of 2009  given the inflation forecast this
means a negative or close to negative real funds rate for almost two years  despite this greenbook
baseline inflation expectations remain reasonably contained and inflation is projected to decline
over the forecast period even as growth picks up toward trend  to put it kindly i have serious
reservations about that scenario  the greenbook discusses an alternative simulation in which there
is greater inflationary pressure  the estimated taylor rule funds path in that is somewhat steeper
than in the baseline  inflation ends up higher at the end of the forecast periodthe end of 2011 and
2012than in the baseline  more progress on inflation will require obviously a steeper path but
even in this alternative simulation inflation expectations only drift up  they do not become
unhinged  if they did i would expect the policy path to have to be considerably tighter in 2009
now i know that talking about money in the context of monetary policy is not very
fashionable these days  but i would like to note that the monetary aggregates as measured by m2
and mzm have exploded  despite the flight to quality and the associated increase in the demand
for money associated with that m2 grew less than 5 percent during the fourth quarter of 2007
since then however its growth rate has nearly tripled  in january it grew 8 percent on an
annualized basis  in february after our rate cuts it grew 18 percent and in march it grew
13 percent  growth rates of mzm are even worse over this intervalfor the three months the
annual rates were 14 42 and 26 percent  such rates suggest to me that there is substantial liquidity
in the economy  while i dont really like the old p model and have had a lot of problems with it at
the back of the greenbook the story it is telling is one of considerable inflation over the next couple
of years
combined the growth in the aggregates the substantially negative real interest rates and the
fact that most versions of the taylor rule call for a higher fed funds rate than we have currently
heighten my angst about the outlook for inflation and our credibility  market participants reacted to
the incoming data by appreciably tightening their policy expectationsat least as implied by the
futures markets as bill dudley pointed outand that has had a negligible effect certainly no
negative effect on markets or the economy more broadly  one interpretation is that the market
participants have also become uncomfortable as i have with a fed funds rate that remains too low
for too long  i take this as a healthy sign actually and one that we shouldnt ignore  indeed we may
just wish to use it to our advantage  i will stop there mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  in looking at the latest blue chip forecasts for
gdp growth i noted that the range between the highest and lowest is among the largest on record
the 10 most optimistic forecasters are predicting over 2 percentage points faster q4overq4
growth than the 10 most pessimistic ones  such forecast dispersion is indicative of the unusually
high degree of uncertainty that we are facing
the greenbook presents one of the most pessimistic economic forecasts yet i find its
recessionary projection quite plausible and see downside risks that could take the economy well
below that forecast  although i found it especially difficult this time to decide on the most likely
outcome for the economy i ended up submitting a forecast that shows somewhat more growth in
2008 than the greenbook even though we shared the same assumption concerning monetary policy
this year  my forecast projects 2008 growth of  percent  this averages no growth in the first half
and 1 percent growth in the second  the unemployment rate increases to just over 5 percent by
the end of this year a bit lower than the greenbook  in one critical areanamely the adverse
effects of financial sector developments on the real economyi remain just as pessimistic as the
greenbook  although the likelihood of a severe financial panic has diminished the risks are by no
means behind us  moreover credit conditions have turned quite restrictive  this credit crunch
reflects the drying up of financing both for markets that were important sources of business and
consumer credit and from banks that are contending with capitaldepleting losses and illiquid assets
among banks the latest senior loan officer opinion survey noted a clear tightening of
lending standards and my own discussions with bankers confirmed this point  they say they are
carefully reassessing and significantly curtailing existing home equity lines of credit as well as
unsecured consumer loans of all sorts  banks are also clamping down on the provision of revolving
business credit even to very creditworthy customers  for example the treasurer of chevron a
highly rated oil company that as you can guess given energy prices has a very strong profit
outlook recently complained to me that banks were reluctant to extend even its credit line  such
reluctance is also evident for lending to students consumers and other businesses  the risk of a
deepening credit crunch remains as a weak economyespecially with further sharp declines in
housing pricesescalates credit losses harms financial institution balance sheets and causes them
to scale back lending even further  my sense from our business contacts is that their perception of
reduced access to credit is causing them to manage their firms liquidity more carefully and is
leading to some deferrals in capital spending projects as a precautionary measure  certainly the
mood is decidedly more pessimistic and cautious
amid the gloom of the credit crunch i do see a possible silver lining in that it may amplify
the effects of the fiscal stimulus package and this is part of the reason that my forecasted downturn
is a little milder than the greenbooks  in particular because of the credit and liquidity
considerations the latest fiscal package could well provide a bigger bang for the buck than the tax
rebates in 2001  first the current tax rebates are more directly targeted at lowerincome
households which are more likely to be credit constrained and to spend the cash once its in hand
second given the current tightening of credit availability households will likely spend an even
greater fraction of the tax rebates than they did in 2001  of course there is considerable uncertainty
about assessing the potential size of these effects  but over the next few months as the checks go
out and the retail sales reports come in we should get a pretty quick preliminary read on how things
are shaping up
regarding inflation the most worrying developments since we met in march have been the
price surges for a wide variety of raw materials and commodities especially the jump in the price of
crude oil  from the us perspective this runup in prices represents mainly a classic supply shock
which could threaten both parts of our dual mandate although the decline in the dollar has slightly
exacerbated the severity of the impact  like the greenbook my forecast for inflation does take
commodity price futures at face value and foresees a levelingout of prices going forward
although i must say after four years of being wrong i am beginning to feel like charlie brown
trying to kick that football  the most recent core consumer price data have shown some
improvement and like the greenbook im optimistic that core inflation will subside to around 1
percent over the forecast period assuming that the commodity prices do finally level off and
compensation remains well behaved
an interesting analysis by bart hobijn of the new york fed as well as my own staff implies
that in an accounting sense passthrough from the runup in oil and crop prices may have boosted
core inflation as much as 03 percentage point over the past two years  so a levelingoff of these
prices could lower not only headline but also core inflation  my core pce inflation forecast is a
tenth or two lower than the greenbook this year and next also because we assume lower pass
through of the dollar depreciation to nonoil import prices  we have been reexamining the data on
this issue and find the evidence quite convincing that passthrough has been quite low recently
lower for example than embodied in the frbus model
with respect to inflation expectations marketbased measures have now edged down  we
took little comfort from this fact however because we had viewed the uptick in inflation
compensation in recent months mainly as a reflection of a higher inflation risk premium and not a
reflection of higher inflation expectations  i am also somewhat concerned that the median
expectation for inflation over the next five to ten years in the michigan survey has ticked up
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i want to focus my comments today on what i have heard
from my ceo contacts  with regard to my district it continues to do well relative to the rest of the
country but it is not immune to the pathology that is afflicting the overall economy  although still
positive economic growth and employment creation are slowing and our manufacturers in the
survey we just took are experiencing substantial price pressures  seventyone percent of our
manufacturers in the survey report higher prices and 65 percent are expecting input prices to be
even higher six months from now
setting aside the 11th district i spoke in depth to 31 ceos nationwide  you have that list
mr chairman and i would like to speak to what i deduced from triangulating those conversations
with what i read in the bluebook and the greenbook  let me note that the focus of my
conversations with these ceos and cfos was not what they have seen or what they are seeing now
but how their behavior is likely to be affected going forward and how they are budgeting going
forward  distilling the inputs to their essence its clear that activity is likely to weaken further
those 21 miles of 89foot flat cars that haul lumber mr chairman are now up to 226 miles
inventories of unsold homes are clearly building and that is important against the background that
march is almost always a good month in the housing or home sales business  the ceo of centex
reports that this is the first down march he has seen and he has been in the business since 1974  it
came down hard20 percent  consumer confidence is weak  job insecurity is spreading
companies are tightening their head counts  banks are tightening credit standards as we have
discussed  according to the ceo of mastercard yearoveryear retail sales to date in aprilthat
is exautos and exgaswere 22 percent the lowest he has ever seen
citibank chase bank of america and the other credit card purveyors are experiencing
high delinquency rates and a significant slowdown in their revenues from credit cards and
walmart reports the cascading use of credit as a form of payment as their ceo for us
operations put it  in short the consumerdriven corrective credit cycle is prolonging the economic
slowdown and vice versa  consistent with this sustained headwind we have revised downward the
dallas forecast and continued for longer our projection of economic anemia we are not among
the four that included the word recession not only for 08 but also for 09 and we have revised
upward to the upper end our sense of projected unemployment  thus from what i am hearing
from what i am reading and from what we are getting from our analysis i acknowledge the thesis
of the presence of a negative feedback loop among gdp growth employment growth and credit
market conditions
i find more worrisome the reports i am receiving on expected price developments and
behavior and i see a feedback loop of another kind at work  page 30 of the bluebook notes as i
think president plosser pointed out and president evans referred to that core pce inflation has
averaged more than 2 percent in every year since 2004 and is forecasted as per davids earlier
comments as doing so again in 2008  what concerns me more is the lefthand panel in chart 1 on
page 4 of the bluebook that indicates that the staffs index of inflation expectations and uncertainty
is now at the top of its range over the last decade  this is confirmed by my corporate contacts
something persistent and pernicious mr chairman has been occurring on the inflation front and
calling into question the credibility of our continued reliance on core measures
here is what i am hearing from my corporate contacts  im going to just mention a few
because it is fairly consistent across the board  from the ceo of the largest retailer in the country
not to be named but located in arkansas laughter i reported last time that they are budgeting price
increases on 10000 items of a little over 5 percent in 2008  yet his comment to me was inflation
is our number 1 concern and its escalating significantly  he added all the information we have
points to an intermediate and longerterm supplydemand problem especially for food and any
energydependent articles  by the way that was verified by the ceo of fritolay who tells me
that they are offsetting their input price escalation of 11 percent in 2008 by raising prices 9 percent
effective last sunday  he added thatand this is interesting in terms of the mindsetwe have
tootherwise well disappoint the street and in these markets no one can afford at this fragile time
to do so
the price pressures are less for clothing and nonfood items but they are still there  i would
like to use the example of jcpenney  jcpenney sells clothing to onehalf of all the families in
america and 60 percent of their sales are apparel  the average price point for an apparel sale at
that retailer is 15  the leading source of apparel is china  according to penneys ceo increases
in chinas labor costs changes in their labor rules and the cost of fuel and of cotton fibers have led
to significantly escalating price pressures  he says that they can eat some of those costs and drive
them down through other offsets and tighter controls but they are planning a 4 percent increase in
apparel costs in 2009  here is his punch line and it is not funnythis is a firstrate ceo one of the
best in the country  we think the customer can take a little more price  after all whats 40 to 60
cents on 15  it wont even be noticed
this is the essence of the accommodation of inflationary expectations and you are
beginning to see this mentality set in in several industries  for example the airlines  we talked
about the increase in the price of crude  if you take what is called the crack spread and figure out
what has happened in terms of jet fuel year over year through midapril jet fuel was up 70 percent
thats an industry average mitigated somewhat by the hedging of southwest airlines which has
been successful  according to the ceo of american airlines this oil is a tsunami  we will have
to get some pricing power or well be left with only one airline southwest  kimberlyclark a
paper producer notices that the weaker dollar and oil are driving realized costs increasingly up
from in their case 250 million in 07 to an estimated 600 million in 08  they have raised
prices as i have previously mentioned but the ceo feels thatand this is a winnerwe are
having to learn how to run a business in an inflationary environment  we got used to productivity
as the driver but we cant drive productivity any harder than we can  we will need more pricing
it even affects semiconductor producers  texas instruments reports that the weakness of the
dollar and the prices of energy gold and copper offset by their hedges added 2 percent non
annualized to their costs in the first quarter  asked what he envisions going forward the cfo said
well that just means we cant spend it elsewhere  we have to take it out of our employees backs
or out of capex  one ceo of a company that is expecting soon to lay off between 12000 and
15000 people and is therefore carefully surveying the attitudes of their employees because they
have a morale problem is finding out that employees are tapping into their 401k plans or not
funding them  in their surveys they find the leading complaint is that the price of gasoline and
food is eating into my living standards  i cant afford them  last but not least just to bring this
home the eagle scout who mows my lawn in dallas sent me a very nice beautiful letter  it is clear
that he and his mother had prepared it on a printer and put a fancy title on it but the rest of the letter
was dear mr fisher i have to levy a 7 percent fuel surcharge  laughter  we gave into ithe
is a nice boy
in summary mr chairman while there are many who have voiced concern with the
adverse feedback loop that runs from the economy to tighter credit conditions and back to the
economy i am very troubled by a different adverse feedback loopnamely the inflation dynamic
whereby reductions in fed funds rates lead to a weaker dollar and upward pressures on global
commodity prices which feed through to higher us inflation  that higher us inflation not only
has a price impact but also leads to cutbacks by consumers and by employers so as to offset the
effects of inflation  i am worried that if we do not respond to higher inflation the whole cycle will
intensify  when economic growth and activity return to normal inflation is likely to have notched
up considerably according to our sense  i know my respected colleagues say that we are willing to
be equally aggressive in raising rates once the outlook for real activity improves but the
practicability of that notion i find in talking to my interlocutors is met with some skepticism and
doubt
with that mr chairman i see a tail risk on the downside of growth  i acknowledge the
argument of president yellen and others  i think im sympathetic but i see a fatter tail perhaps an
otters tail on inflation  i am hearing this loud and clear from my corporate contacts  i believe that
the risk posed by inflation is more significant than the extension of further anemia in the economy
especially now that we have put in place innovative liquidity bridging mechanisms which we are
amplifying upon today  mr chairman the other day governor kohn reminded me that reasonable
people can disagree and he quipped that he hoped that we could agree on the followingthat we
are at least reasonable people  laughter  im doing my very best i hope to provide reasonable
alternative perspectives and i hope you will judge me on that basis  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  that made me dizzy  laughter  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  without judgmental adjustments the
boston fed forecast is somewhat more optimistic than the greenbook  as in the greenbook our
gdp is weak in the first half of this year though neither of the first two quarters actually turns
negative  our slightly more optimistic forecast assumes that consumption and business fixed
investment are weak but not as weak as in the greenbook and then the fiscal and monetary stimuli
are sufficient for the economy to pick up in the second half of this year  in a sense the greenbook
represents another mode in the forecast distribution with probability roughly equal to our forecast
the big risk to our forecast is that the financial turmoil and housing price declines which are not
fully reflected in the boston model result in a greater drag on the economy  such an outcome
would largely close the gap between the greenbook and our forecast  in short the downside risks to
our forecast are appreciable  with a monetary policy assumption similar to the greenbooks we
have core pce below 2 percent in 2009 but the unemployment rate remains well above the nairu
even at the end of 2010  if we sought to keep inflation below 2 percent but did not want an
extended period in which the unemployment rate was above the nairu our model would require
more easing than currently assumed in the greenbook
since the last meeting the economic data have remained weak  private payroll employment
declined by approximately 100000 jobs on average over the past three months and the
unemployment rate increased 03 percentage point  in addition the labor market weakness was
widespread across industries  such labor market weakness is likely to aggravate an already
troubling housing story  to date falling housing prices have disproportionately affected subprime
borrowers and those who purchased securitized products  however if housing prices continue to
decline rapidly that will begin to affect more prime borrowers and a wide array of financial
institutions  smaller financial institutions that were largely unaffected by the financial turmoil last
august are beginning to see increases in delinquencies and those with outsized exposures in
construction loans are now experiencing significant duress  commercial real estate loans are also
now experiencing increased delinquencies  like the greenbook i am concerned that commercial
real estate may be the next sector to experience problems  however the biggest concern remains
that rising delinquencies and falling housing prices cause a much higher rate of mortgage defaults
than we have experienced historically  should these mounting problems become more pronounced
we are likely to see credit availability for small and mediumsized businesses affected  that sector
has not to date been significantly affected by the financial turmoil
many financial indicators have improved since the last meeting as was highlighted in bills
report  the stock market has moved up  many credit spreads have narrowed  treasury securities
and repurchase agreements are trading in morenormal ranges and credit default swaps for many
financial firms have improved  nonetheless several ominous trends remain in financial markets
the liborois spread has widened so borrowers tied to libor rates have seen those rates rise
more than 25 basis points since the last meeting  similarly the taf stopout rate in the last three
auctions was higher than the primary credit rate providing another indicator that banks remain in
need of dollar term funds  finally the assetbacked commercial paper market is once again
experiencing difficulties  rates on assetbacked commercial paper have been rising and there is a
risk that more of the paper will end up on bank balance sheets  higher food and energy prices are
both a drag on the economy and a cause for concern with inflation  but despite the extended
sequence of supply shocks i do not see evidence that inflation expectations are no longer anchored
labor markets do not indicate that the commodity price increases are causing wage pressures and
such pressures are even less likely if the unemployment rate continues to increase  many of the
financial indicators of inflation such as the fiveyearforward rate have fallen significantly from
their peaks earlier this year  finally core pce over the past year has been 2 percent and most
econometricbased forecasts expect that the weakness we are experiencing should result in core and
total pce inflation at or below 2 percent next year  overall the downside risks to demand that i
listed in the outset seem the more compelling cause for concern  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  our highlevel view of current
circumstances is that the real economy is quite weak with weakness widespread  the financial
markets are turning optimistic and elevated prices and inflation remain a serious concern  reports
from our directors and district business contacts were broadly similar to the incoming national data
and information from other districts reported in the beige book  observations from such district
input support themes in the national datafor example employment growth is quite weak  in this
round of director reports and conversations i heard an increasing number of reports of holds on
hiring and expansion plans  one representative of a major retailer of home improvement goods
reported that hiring for seasonal employees will be down 40 percent this spring  this translates to
approximately 45000 jobs  nonresidential real estate development continues to slow in the
district especially in florida and georgia  of the 18 commercial contractors contacted in april 15
expect that commercial construction will be weaker for the rest of 2008 than for the same period in
2007 with several predicting even more pronounced weakness in 2009  on the brighter side
florida realtors are anticipating that sales over the next few months will exceed yearago levels
and builders are signaling less weakness than in recent reports  this is a level of optimism we have
not heard from florida for some time  however housing markets in the rest of the district continue
to weaken  we heard several complaints that obtaining financing is a serious problem for
commercial and residential developers and consumer homebuyers  in sum the information from
the sixth district seems to confirm what i believe is the continuing story of the national real
economy captured in the greenbookthat is shrinking net job creation developing weakness in
nonresidential construction and a bottom in the housing market still not in sight
in contrast conditions in the financial markets appear to have improved substantially  as
has been my practice i had several conversations with contacts in a variety of financial firms
there was a consistent tone suggesting that financial markets are likely to have seen the worst  this
does not mean that no concerns were expressed  some contacts had concerns about european banks
and credit markets and concern about the value of the dollar notwithstanding the recent rally is
coming up in more contexts  concern was expressed about the dollars disruptive effect on
commodity markets in turn affecting the general price levelin particular the effect of high energy
prices on a wide spectrum of businesses consumer products and even on crime rates in rural and far
suburban areas related to the theft of copper wiring and piping from vacant homes and air
conditioning units  i worry that a narrative is developing along the lines that the ecb is concerned
about inflation and the fed not so much  this narrative encourages a dollar carry trade mentioned
again by some financial contacts that puts downside pressure on the dollar that potentially
undermines both growth and inflation objectives  i remain concerned about the vulnerability of
financial markets to a shock or surprise but overall my contacts express the belief that conditions
are improving  the atlanta forecast submission sees flat real gdp growth in the first half of 2008
with gradual improvement in the second half  we continue to believe that the drag on economic
activity from the problems in the housing and credit markets will persist into 2009
on the inflation front i am still projecting a decline in the rate of inflation over this year
ive submitted forecasts of declining headline inflation in 2009 and 2010 but i should note that my
staffs current projections suggest that improvement to the degree i would like to see may require
some rises in the federal funds rate  it is my current judgment that with an additional 25 basis point
reduction in the fed funds rate target policy will be appropriately calibrated to the gradual recovery
of growth and the lowering of the inflation level envisioned in our forecast  this judgment is based
on the view that with a negative real funds rate by some measures policy is in stimulative territory
that a lower cost of borrowing in support of growth depends more on marketdriven tightening of
credit spreads than a lower policy rate that further cuts may contribute to unhelpful movements in
the dollar exchange rate and that extension of the four liquidity facilities may allow us to decouple
liquidity actions from the fed funds rate target  in my view we are in a zone of diminishing returns
from further funds rate cuts beyond a possible quarter in this meeting  that said as stated in the
greenbook uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the real economy is very high and the
committee needs in my view to preserve flexibility to deal with unanticipated developments
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the economy of the eighth district continues
to show signs of weakness  the services sector has continued to soften and sales of both general
and big box retailers are down from the same period last year  the residential real estate sector has
continued to decline throughout the district  across major metro areas sales were about 15 percent
below the level from last year and singlefamily permits were down about 30 percent  employment
growth has slowed and is estimated to have turned negative in march for many areas  typically
however employment growth in the district has been stronger than that for the united states as a
whole  manufacturing has remained roughly flat despite temporary shutdowns that have affected
domestic automobile production  also commercial real estate construction remains strong and
vacancy rates are low however there are increases in the number of delayed projects  banks in the
district are still in good shape generally speaking  there have been modest increases in total loans
in all categories including real estate
contacts in the shipping and trucking industries reported a mixed bag  in some instances
business seems to be holding up whereas in others it is down substantially  these businesses are
being critically affected by increases in energy prices  similarly a contact in the fast food industry
painted a picture of a business struggling with substantial increases in commodity prices  on the
other hand a contact in a large technology firm indicated that business is holding up quite well in
part because a large fraction of this firms business is overseas  contacts in the energy sector
reported robust business prospects as expected  a contact at a large financial firm suggested that
the discovery process concerning assetbacked securities which has been ongoing for many months
has effectively come to a close  the idea that the discovery processand the considerable
macroeconomic uncertainty that attended that processis over is an important consideration at this
juncture  my sense is that expectations of future economic performance are changing rapidly  the
probability that the us economy will enter into a debilitating depressionlike state has fallen
dramatically
in the meantime other risks have increased markedlyin particular that the fomc will
lose credibility with respect to its inflation goals  the us economy has certainly encountered a
large shock  monetary policy can mitigate the effects of a large shock but cannot be expected to
completely offset exceptional disturbances  attempts to do too much may create more and more
dangerous problems in the future  bestpractice monetary policy would do well it seems to me to
avoid setting the stage for future problems
the problems with the rate structure which is too low are threefold  first there is the risk
of setting up a new bubble  the exceptionally low rates of a few years ago are sometimes cited as
providing fuel for todays problems  some have argued that todays commodity price increases are
exactly that new bubble  second continued unabated reductions in interest rates will bring the zero
bound issue into play with unknown consequences  third still lower rates will push the envelope
further on inflationary expectations  those expectations may appear to be reasonably well anchored
today but that is because the private sector expects us to take actions to keep inflation low and
stable  should those expectations become unmoored it will be too late and an era of higher and
more volatile inflation would be very costly for american households  much has been done
already  a low rate environment has been created and has been in place only for a short time
marginal moves at this juncture are minor compared with the general thrust of policy over the last
nine months  the committee would do much better at this meeting by taking steps to address
eroding credibility  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a break for coffee and return
at 445  thank you
recess
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene  president pianalto whenever you
are ready
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  regardless to whom i talk with these days
the conversation quickly turns to both the fragile condition of financial markets and the spectacular
rise in energy and commodity prices  i had hoped that one of these problems would have gone
away by now but clearly that is not how conditions have unfolded since our last meeting  the
bankers with whom i talked are paying close attention to their capital and liquidity positions  they
remain concerned about wide bidasked spreads and low trading volumes in a broad array of
securities markets  indeed the repercussions of financial turmoil appear to have touched every
channel of credit intermediation  it appears that a rewiring of credit channels is simply going to take
some time to work out
the most significant financial news coming out of the fourth district is the 7 billion
investment of new capital into national city bank  national city is the countrys tenth largest
commercial bank and its problems with mortgagerelated credits are now well known  national
city still has much work to do to clean up its balance sheet just as many other financial institutions
with impaired capital positions must do before they can stand on solid ground again  although the
fragile state of the financial sector represents a pretty sizable risk to my economic outlook the
national city situation along with other stories im hearing suggests that modest progress is being
made
with regard to district business conditions the stories i hear remain downbeat  commercial
builders are reporting mixed though generally positive firstquarter numbers  but their expectations
for retail sales in the stores that they lease out across the country have deteriorated and they are
fairly pessimistic about 2008 growth prospects  one large national commercial developer whom i
talked with told me that for the first time in his 45year career his company has seen sales declines
in march in every retail center that they own across the country  the manufacturers i talked with
indicated moderate firstquarter revenue growth as export markets especially in asia and eastern
europe are still helping to sustain production despite weak domestic demand  at the same time
manufacturers report intense commodity price pressures and they report little resistance as they
attempt to pass along the rising cost of commodities to their customers
the projection i submitted for this meeting shows real gdp growth under 1 percent in 2008
with virtually all of that growth coming in the second half of the year  this is a decidedly more
pessimistic projection than the one i submitted in january but not materially different from the
outlook when we met just six weeks ago  i have however boosted my headline inflation projection
for 2008 compared with what i submitted in january and it is somewhat higher than what i was
estimating when we met in midmarch  although i am still projecting that the slack in the economy
will be sufficient to bring the core inflation number under the 2 percent threshold sometime next
year i am now anticipating a little more passthrough of commodity prices into core measures than
i thought probable six weeks ago  indeed every time i see commodity prices ratcheting up i
become less confident that slack alone will be able to prevent an upward drift in the inflation trend
to be clear i think the downside risks that we face in the real economy remain substantial and i am
inclined to believe that some insurance against those risks is probably warranted  but in taking such
a step i am inclined to judge that the downside risks we face in the real economy will be roughly in
balance with the upside risks that we face from a rising inflation trend  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  economic activity continues to be slow in the
tenth district with a soft tone in our residential and nonresidential construction and certainly in our
retail sales  mitigating this weakness however to some extent is continued strength in energy and
agriculture exports and to a lesser degree manufacturing  with regard to exports one interesting
development is a shortage of shipping containers domestically and internationally that is limiting the
volume of exports of both our agricultural and some of our manufacturing products  on balance
though the district activity continues to be stronger than the national economy and this is reflected
in better employment growth and firm labor markets in many parts of our region
in my recent discussions with directors at our bank and in our branches and the economic
advisory council members several themes have been prominent  concern about inflation has
escalated to the highest level ive been involved with in the last decade  businesses across the
board are experiencing the largest input cost pressures in recent memory for them  many businesses
have not been able to absorb these cost pressures and have raised prices to both retail and business
customers and generally speaking businesses are finding much less resistance to price increases
than in the past  businesses also report that suppliers are increasingly reluctant to make contractual
price quotes very far in the future
we have also been monitoring the effects of credit availability on business capital spending
in our area  although businesses report some tightening of credit conditions credit costs and
availability are not the primary factors behind reduced capital spending plans  bank loans have
actually continued to grow  instead businesses cite uncertainty about the economic outlook as the
main impediment to investment  they are in a waitandsee mode  so spending is being held back
not for financial reasons but just caution  indeed they suggest that uncertainty about whether
monetary policy will be eased further is a factor currently inhibiting their capital spending plans
they want to see when were done
turning to the broader economic output and the national economy i have revised down my
growth estimate for the first half of 2008 but have had few changes to my longerterm outlook
compared with the greenbook i see somewhat stronger growth this year and somewhat weaker
growth next year  weaker growth in the first half of this year is coming largely from the effects of
higher energy prices on consumer and business spending coupled with the continued weakness in
residential construction  i would say that the effect of high energy prices is now about as large as or
even larger than the contraction in residential construction and i think that the energy outlook
constitutes a main downside risk to growth in the period ahead  in contrastand contrary to the
greenbook and the views of somei think that energy and housing perhaps now more than credit
problems are holding back economic growth  certainly credit conditions have continued to tighten
as reflected in the april senior loan officer opinion survey and markets for many assetbacked
securities of course have shut down  but the availability of credit for good business and household
borrowers does not appear to have really been restricted that much  they are pricing more wisely
for risk and that is probably a positive  consequently the downside economic risks from a
pronounced credit contraction appear to have diminished considerably over the past few months
i want to turn to inflation  in my view the inflation outlook has worsened considerably
for the first time in many years we are seeing significant inflation pressure from goods prices
especially imported goods prices  moreover the recent moderation in monthly inflation numbers is
coming mainly from some softness in service prices which in my opinion is unlikely to continue
more optimistic views of inflation including those in the greenbook rely heavily on economic
slack and a turnaround in food and energy prices to improve the outlook  i am skeptical on both
counts  i do not think that there will be as much slack generated in the current slowdown as does
the greenbook and there is evidence that the effects of output and employment gaps on inflation
have fallen well actually more than a little over the past two decades  furthermore i have not seen
any indication that elevated energy and food price inflation is likely to dissipate soon as many of
these pressures are reflective of international economic developments that we have talked about
here including the weakness in the dollar
i believe that we are entering a dangerous period if i can use that word in which inflation
expectations are beginning to move higher and inflation psychology is becoming more prominent in
business decisions  in this regard i also do not take much comfort from favorable readings of labor
costs as wages tend to follow prices in my experience  in these circumstances i am concerned that
maintaining a highly accommodative policy stance for an extended period would greatly increase
the likelihood that inflation exceeds our longrun objectives  thank you
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  fifth district economic conditions softened
further in recent weeks  following a popup in march our manufacturing contacts said that factory
activity lost momentum in april  services firms that we surveyed again reported tepid growth in
their revenues and retail sales continued to be very weak  in real estate the story is mixed  our
housing markets continue to post generally slow sales but recent anecdotes suggest some scattered
firming  realtors and others indicate that northern virginia and maryland have seen a spring
bounce in sales in recent weeks  one realtor said that a factor supporting sales is that sellers now
seem more willing to come off 2006 prices  the charlotte market has also seen a spring bounce
coastal areas in the carolinas hard hit until recently are said to be more active lately  of course it
is hard to know what these anecdotes mean on a seasonally adjusted basis and contacts caution that
it is too soon to call the bottom  in contrast home sales are weakening in many other areas of the
carolinas where markets had posted sales and price gains well after the national market had turned
down  residential construction in nearly all areas continues to weaken  on the commercial real
estate front conditions have softened somewhat although in dc proper commercial rents are firm
and vacancies are low  commercial construction activity is broadly softening
my reading of the national report since the last fomc meeting is that the real outlook has
not changed much  in particular we still appear to be in a recession  payroll employment has
continued to decline falling an average of 77000 per month in the first quarter  unemployment is
rising although it is still relatively low  nonresidential construction is weakening and the falloff in
architectural billings is particularly discouraging  other business investment has been soft as well
consumer spending like business spending appears to have slowed to a crawl  the length and
depth of the recession are likely to depend on stabilization in the housing market  the sharp decline
in home construction has continued unabated and outside of the onemonth tickup in the brand
new as yet untested monthly homeprice index from ofheo theres no sign of any bottoming in
any of the national data on housing  having said that i noted earlier some scattered reports of a
seasonable pickup in home sales  so theres a chance perhaps only a slim one that well see some
stability in markets this summer
concerns are often voiced about the possibility of broad spillovers from financial market
conditions in the form of sharply tightening credit conditions for households and businesses  but if
we look past the drama in wholesale markets and the enduser credit markets that gave rise to it in
housing and buyout financing evidence of such spillover is hard to come by at least so far  it is
true that delinquencies have risen across a broad class of creditscommercial real estate ci
loans and auto and credit card portfolios for exampleand lenders are reporting tightening terms
across many of these borrower classes  but that is generally what happens in recessions  spreads
widen and credit flows fall because many consumers and firms become genuinely riskier  so far
delinquency rates and credit spreads faced by consumers and firms appear to be well within the
bounds of what happened in past credit cycles
more broadly recent experiences have revealed important new information about the
efficacy of some prominent financial market mechanismsinformation that is in turn affecting the
current behavior of financial market participants  auctionrate securities for example seem to have
worked well for decades because investors attached relatively low probability to contractual clauses
that reset their rates and prevented their exit  reaching those clauses has naturally caused investors
to update their estimates of the probability of reaching those clauses and the result has been much
lessin fact virtually nildemand for those securities  similarly recent experience has brought
dramatic revelations about the informativeness or lack thereof of credit agencies ratings of asset
backed securities  its revelations would seem to warrant fairly dramatic shifts in investor portfolios
just as a matter of bayesian updating  these changing expectations in light of recent information
revelation are just as much a change in fundamentals as the invention of the light bulb
spreads in interbank markets certainly are elevated of course but one fundamental factor
here is the continuing uncertainty about the severity of looming losses on mortgagebacked
securities  another fundamental factor is the demand for term funding by european banks about
which uncertainty remains regarding mortgagerelated losses that may be imminent  those sources
of uncertainty will persist as long as uncertainty about the bottom of the housing cycle persists
at our march meeting i had strong concerns about inflation particularly the increase in five
year fiveyearahead inflation compensation and the rising trend in overall inflation  since then we
received moremoderate inflation numbers for february and fiveyear fiveyearahead inflation
compensation has backed off as well  although i still believe that these tips spreads are too high
to be consistent with stable longrun inflation below 2 percent its heartening to see them come
down following our march meeting  it seems reasonable to infer that the improvement in inflation
expectations occurred because of the unanticipated emphasis on inflation risks in our statement and
the 25 basis point surprise on the funds rate  that response however confirms for me the
hypothesis that the previous erosion in expectations was caused largely by the aggressiveness of our
january policy actions  i believe that substantial risks for inflation and our credibility remain  the
michigan survey number for 12monthahead inflation expectations popped up to 48 percent a
relatively large number  the march cpi was again too high and further increases in food and
energy prices in recent weeks will continue to press headline inflation upward  persistently high
headline numbers could become ingrained in household and business decisionmaking  i believe the
risk remains that cutting the funds rate again will have undesirable effects on inflation expectations
the real federal funds rate using the greenbooks forecast of overall pce inflation is now between
minus  and minus  percent  that seems like plenty of stimulus for now  thank you
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well for some time i have been using the
headwinds period of the early 1990s as a frame of reference for thinking about credit conditions
economic growth and inflation prospects for the next several years  i wont belabor that
comparison much this afternoon except to say that i continue to find it helpful  with that and
given that the information we have received since our march meeting hasnt caused me to
change my views about financial conditions or about growth let me just say that i continue to
expect financial headwinds of some intensity to persist well into next year  i think that the
economy will declinecontract in this quarter and in the next quarterbefore growth resumes
and that the resumption will initially be fairly mild  so my outlook for economic growth next
year is below that of the greenbook  it is a pretty modest outlook
recent anecdotes from business contacts and from people in financial services firms have
not been what i would call overly negative  if i were to give those anecdotes more weight i
would probably be somewhat more optimistic about the economic outlook than i am  but i am
guessing that those anecdotes are underestimating the weight of the credit constraints that are in
train and peopleat least people that i have talked todont fully appreciate that yet
turning to inflation on average it seems to me that the inflation situation and its
prospects are no better and possibly worse than i had been anticipating  to be sure the core
measures of inflation have not accelerated recently and look to be what i might call close to
acceptable looking at their recent performance  but we have been warned that some of that
better performance is likely to prove transitory  meanwhile headline inflation has been elevated
and has tended to surprise on the upside  moreover i worry that the persistence of sizable
increases in energy and general commodity prices will have a more pronounced effect on core
inflation going forward than they have in the recent past  further i have the sense both from
some estimates of inflation expectations and from the comments and questions i have been
getting about inflation and the foreign exchange value of the dollar that the publics conviction
about monetary policys willingness and ability to maintain low inflation is starting to waver
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman geithner
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  in terms of markets fed
credibility and negative surprises on the data relative to our forecasts i think this has been the
best intermeeting period in a long time  the markets reflect increased confidence that policy will
be effective in mitigating the risks both of a systemic financial crisis and of a very deep
protracted recession  we have seen a substantial upward movement in the expected path of the
fed funds rate and in real forward rates significant diminution in the negative skewness in fed
funds rate expectations and a significant move down in a range of different measures of credit
risk premiums and markets have been pretty robust despite bad news over the past few weeks or
so  medium and longterm expectations in tips have moved down and we have had a very
important and substantial additional wave of inflow of equity into the financial system
our forecast though is roughly the same as it was in march and it is broadly similar to
the path outlined in the greenbook  we expect economic activity to follow a path somewhere
between the last downturna relatively mild downturnand that of 1990  we expect
underlying inflation to moderate somewhat over the forecast period to something below
2 percent  we see the risks to the growth forecast still skewed to the downside though
somewhat less so than in march and we see the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly
balanced  uncertainty around both paths though is unusually high
i want to make four points  first on economic growth again i still think we face
substantial risk in this adverse selfreinforcing interaction among falling house prices slower
spending and financial headwinds  even with the very substantial adjustment in housing
construction that has already occurred and even if demand for housing stays stable at these
levels we still have several quarters ahead of us before the decline in housing prices starts to
moderate  a further falloff in aggregate demand during this period would raise the prospect of a
much larger peaktotrough decline in housing prices with higher risk of larger collateral
damage to confidence spending credit supply et cetera  weakness as the chairman has
reminded us several times over the past few years tends to cumulate and spread in these
conditions and weakness may only just be beginning outside of housing  the saving rate here
may have to rise substantially further  the world is behind us in this cycle and it is likely to
slow further diminishing potential help from net exports going forward
second financial conditions are i think still very fragile  the financial system as a
whole still looks as though it is short of the capital necessary to support growth in lending to
creditworthy households and borrowers  parts of the system still need to bring leverage down
significantly  liquidity conditions in some markets are still impaired securitization markets are
still essentially shut  i think the markets now reflect too much confidence in our willingness and
ability to prevent large and small financial failures  we are going to disappoint them on the
small ones which may increase the probability they attach to the large  at least i hope we
disappoint them on the small ones
third i think the inflation outlook as many of you have said still has this very
uncomfortable feel to itvery high headline inflation very high readings on the michigan
survey and the dollar occasionally showing the spiral of feeding energy and commodity prices
and vice versa  i sat next to paul volcker when he gave his speech in new york the other day
and he said that the world today feels as it did in the 1970s  i was alive in the 1970s but only
just  laughter  but i think it is better than that  it has to be better than that  core has come in
below expectations  david is not going to explain all of that away by these temporary reversible
factors  you have all acknowledged that there is somewhat of an improvement in inflation
expectations at mediumterm horizon  it is very important that you have not seen any material
pressure in broad measures of labor compensation  profit margins are coming down but they are
still unusually high  the path of output relative to potential both here and around the rest of the
world is going to significantly diminish pressure on resource utilization going forward even if
you have other forces that push up demand for energy and food secularly  i think it is worth
remembering that we had a very very large sustained relative price shock in the years preceding
this downturn with very little passthrough to core inflation  in fact in many ways core
inflation moderated over that period with output to potential much tighter
fourth on monetary policy it seems to me that we are very close to a level that should
put us in a good position to navigate these conflicting pressures ahead  what matters for the
outlook is the relationship between the real fed funds rate and our estimates of equilibrium
although we cant measure the latter with any precision those estimates of equilibrium have to
be substantially lower than normal because of what is happening in financial markets  the
greenbook and bluebook presentations suggest that the real fed funds rate now is about at
equilibrium  you can look at it through a number of prisms and see some accommodationsee
the real fed funds rate somewhat below equilibrium now  we wont know the answer until this
is long over  i think that we are probably now within the zone where we are providing some
insurance against the risk of a very bad macroeconomic financial outcome without creating too
much risk of an inflation spiral  we should try for an outcome tomorrow in our action and in our
statement that is pretty close to market neutral
one final point about the future  what strikes me as most implausible in our forecast in
new york and i think in the average of our submissions is the speed with which we expect to
return to growth rates that are close to estimates of longterm potential  a more prudent
assumption might be for a more protracted period of belowtrend growth for a bunch of familiar
reasons  i dont know if that is the most likely outcome but it is a plausible and realistic
outcome  i dont think we should be directing policy at trying to induce an unrealistically quick
return to what might be considered morenormal growth rates over time  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  my forecasts of output and inflation for this
and the next two years are in the central tendencies of the committee forecasts  my okuns law
machine went haywire under the pressure of debbies deadline laughter so my unemployment
forecasts need to be revised  but i hit the 500 deadline i think  i have stronger growth in 2008
than the greenbook because i was hesitant to adopt the staffs assumption about persistent
serially correlated downside misses relative to fundamentals in consumption and investment
implied by entering a recessionary period when we havent seen those misses yet  but i didnt
discount this possibility entirely reasoning that the extraordinarily depressed business and
household sentiment was significant  i came out between the greenbook baseline and the near
term upside risk alternative scenario
despite slightly stronger growth than in the greenbook i have roughly the same headline
and core inflation paths that are declining gradually through the next few years  i took some
slight encouragement from recent better readings on core  i reasoned that flat commodity prices
would reverse any recent tendency for inflation expectations to rise and i anticipate that vacant
housing units will continue to put downward pressure on rent increases
i have a couple of observations on the outlook  first i think the expectation of
improving financial conditions is critical to the favorable mediumterm outcome for the economy
that president geithner was just talking about  we dont really know what the current state of
overall financial conditions is and how spending is likely to respond to them  directionally i
think we can say that the severe deterioration that was much in evidence around the time of the
last meeting has stopped as concerns about an even more generalized set of failuresthe seizing
up of markets and lendinghave abated with our actions and with successful capitalraising by
intermediaries  we have seen improvements in many segments of the markets but continued
deterioration in term funding suggests to me that there are continued worries about and pressures
on credit availability and credit availability and the cost of credit will be under some pressure as
credit is reintermediated through the banks  even with some of the recent gains markets are
still fragile and impaired  spreads have retraced only a small portion of the runup since last
summer  i noticed in bills charts that most of those spreads are back down to say those in
january and in january we thought the markets were pretty impaired  so they are still very
very high by historical standards  mortgage securitization markets away from gses remain
broken  there are problems in some other securitization markets including cmbs  a number
of intermediate and longerterm interest rates are still higher than they were before the crisis hit
in august  baa corporate bonds which is about the median borrower rating for a corporation
longterm muni bonds and prime jumbo mortgages are all higher than before we did any easing
nonprice terms and standards are being tightened considerably judging in part from the senior
loan officer opinion survey and i think that process is likely to continue for a while
to be sure shortterm interest rates are a lot lower than they were in august  but i
suspect that a continuation of current conditions would not be consistent with much of a pickup
in growth and an eventual return toward full employment  this is a circumstance in which
relationships between the federal funds rate and other measures of financial conditions have
changed very very substantially and characterizing the stance of policy and financial conditions
by looking at some measure of the real federal funds rate can be quite misleading in these
circumstances  i think we need to be careful about how we characterize and think about the
stance of policy  the sense that it is neutral right now much less accommodative depends very
much on our expectations of substantial increases in risktaking in financial markets  now i do
think that the most likely path is improving financial market conditions lower spreads reopened
securitization markets and stabilization and maybe partial reversal of some of the tighter terms
that have evolved  but this process is going to be slow  until the housing market shows more
signs of stabilizing it is more likely to be subject to backsliding than to sudden unexpected
improvements
a corollary to this line of thinking is that there isnt a lot of ease in the pipeline in the
conventional sense  our reductions in the fed funds rate have not eased financial conditions
they have kept them from tightening even more than they would have done otherwise  the
lagged effects of policy easing come from improvements in financial markets  that is as we
look forward the lagged effects of policy easing come from the improvements in financial
markets that allow the reductions in the actual and expected paths of shortterm rates to show
through to the cost of capital more broadly defined  this is a longer and more nuanced process
than the usual rules of thumb about seeing the effects of ease on output after x quarters and
inflation after y quarters
my second point about the outlook is that the risks around my forecast for growth are still
to the downside  uncertainty is huge  we are sailing in a fog in uncharted waters and the depth
finder is on the fritz  so much for sailing analogies  laughter  too bad bill poole is not here
though i am glad jim is here  let me note that for the record  laughter  downside risks from
financial market meltdown have been reduced though not eliminated  but i think an important
source of downside risk now is the economy itselfthe threat of recessionary tendencies taking
hold  i am told we have never had three months of substantial employment declines and
business and household sentiment as depressed as they are right now without sliding into a
recession  businesses and households have been unusually cautious in how they invest their
savings moving into governmentonly money funds and bank deposits boosting m2 and
demanding much larger compensation for taking risks  they are facing much tighter terms for
their credit and uncertainty about its availability  it seems to me there is a reasonable possibility
that this extraordinary caution in managing their financial portfolios and uncertainty about credit
availability will carry over into their spending decisions  that is not my projection or apparently
the central tendency of the committee but it must be a significant downside risk
in contrast the risk to total inflation seems skewed to the upside by the potential behavior
of commodity prices  i dont understand why these prices have risen so much over the last six
months or so  to be sure over the last several years the rise in prices must have reflected
increasing demand in emergingmarket economies but over the past halfyear the prospects for
global growth have weakened  in those circumstances i would expect the effects of lower
interest ratessay in the united statesto be offset by weaker demand  still prices have risen
the possibility that those types of surprises will continue poses an upside risk to headline
inflation and along with that a risk to inflation expectations  nonetheless i saw the risk around
a gradual downtrend in core inflation as about balanced with the possibility of greater slack
offsetting the possibility of higher commodity prices  i take some comfort in my projection for
core inflation and implicitly for the more persistent aspects of overall inflation from the
continued moderate increases in labor compensation  those increases have been moderate for
some time despite very high headline inflation for several years along with stillelevated
markups for nonfinancial businesses
outside of commodities cost pressures appear to be muted and businesses are able to
absorb increases  still i agree that commodity price increases like any supply shock have
complicated our choices  we are facing a sluggish economy with downside risks as well as
uncomfortably high total inflation that is feeding through to some limited extent into core
inflation and by some measures into inflation expectations especially nearterm expectations  i
do think however that we need to keep in mind that the higher inflation is largely a function of
these commodity prices rather than a broad acceleration in overall prices  core inflation has
come in less than we anticipated it would  i also take some comfort relative to some of the tone
i have heard around the table in what has happened in markets over the intermeeting period
markets have built in another  point decline in the fed funds rate but then an increase further
out  so somehow they are taking this promise of an increase seriously  at the same time they
did that the dollar roseit didnt falland the longterm inflation compensation built into
markets came down  so i dont see the evidence in financial markets that we are on the cusp of
the broad decline in our credibility that i have sensed that some others see around the table
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  as has been described by most around the
table official data on the real economy suggest weakness but havent materially changed since
we met in midmarch  others have talked in more detail about weakening labor markets poor
consumer sentiment and worrying trends in consumer spending  certainly the reports through
march that i have received are that consumer spending in march was as bad as anyone who was
in the business of retail or credit card spending could have envisioned  that is certainly
disappointing  oddly there are at least some preliminary data through the first few weeks of
april of some improvement but i dont take much signal from them  also obviously as others
around the table have said the tone trading and expectations of financial market participants
have improved markedly  if only i were as confident  whereas market participants only some
weeks ago saw fear they now perceive promise  whether that is the triumph of hope over
experience only time will tell but i am skeptical
let me talk for a few moments about a couple of positive factors that should be helping
and four or so negative factors  first on the positive side i want to give voice to the capital
raising that a couple of others around the table have referred to  we and the treasury have been
calling for some months for capitalraising across all types of financial institutions  the
questions then were whether financial institutions were willing to take the dilution and go raise
capital  at least equally as important was whether there would be sufficient investor demand  i
think the answer to both of those questions appears to be yes  investor demand from nearly all
sourcesincluding sovereign wealth funds hedge funds and traditional longonly managers
has funded virtually all classes of financial institutionsthat is investment banks money center
banks regional banks and community banksacross the capital structureequities
convertibles and preferred debtin a huge range of distressed and morestable situations  i
think that is invariably a very encouraging sign and we should only be so lucky that those
markets remain wide open  is this improvement likely to be enduring  this strikes me as pretty
consequential as to whether or not we see the economy respond as favorably in the second half
of this year as the greenbook suggests  is the improvement in equity markets in leveraged
loans and in highyield markets and the narrowing of cds spreads sustainable or is there more
bad news to come that is not priced into the market  my own view is that balance sheets are on
the road to repair but that income statements for these financial institutions remain highly
challenged  march was a terrible month for financial institutions profitability which should
make it harder for credit to expand as would be hoped for with any sort of vshaped or u
shaped recovery
the second positive factor building on the increase in capital is really what is going on
among the fortune 2000 particularly the nonfinancial fortune 2000  earnings look pretty
stubborn and solid  though they have come off their peaks corporate profit levels are quite
remarkable for all of the things that are wrong in this economy and they look to me to be
anachronistic with previous periods of recession  the balance sheets of those fortune 2000
companies look excellent  the investmentgrade markets remain wide open  i think the question
is whether those fortune 2000 will be hiring workers during the next two or three years in the
united states and on that front i am probably reasonably skeptical
so if those are the positive factors let me turn to the negative  first consumer weakness
seems to be spreading  the largest credit card providers report that credit card spend is
deterioratingagain absent a couple of odd noises in apriland that the strains showing up as
delinquency which were once only in states where housing issues were predominant now seem
to be in other states as well  second credit availability for small business seems under
remarkable pressure  not only has the senior loan officer opinion survey continued to be
disappointing large money center banks appear to be pulling back from some segments of the
small business markets entirely  third interbank funding market problems as others have
discussed seem inconsistent with the broader improvement in credit markets  it is a troubling
sign that all might not be as well as it appears in this curative process  a fourth and final
negative factor is inflation  the greenbook which has a much more benign forecast for inflation
than i do revised up the forecast for core and headline inflation in the second half of 2008 as
david said  i am still more worried about inflation prospects  as for inflation expectations and
possible second and thirdorder effects of these changes in prices trading and anecdotes over
the last several weeks and months continued to be troubling  i have spent less time in my
remarks on inflation than on growth but only because i suppose there is less to say  the trends
are troubling  the relationships among our policy actions the foreign exchange value of the
dollar and commodity prices are worth further scrutiny  in summary although we should be
pleased with the official data on the economy as not deteriorating in the intermeeting period and
with financial markets that have certainly exceeded my own expectations for improvement i
remain quite concerned about pressures on both sides of the dual mandatea discussion that we
will take up more in the next round  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  as i have talked about many times before i
see what is happening as a continuing slow burn after the fires really heated up for a little while
back in march  things have cooled off again  but exactly as governor kohn said we now seem
to be comforted at levels that caused us extreme distress last fall and in january  so i think it is
important to put it into that context  there certainly has been improvement but it is a little early
to declare victorynot that anyone has but i think we just have to be very mindful of that
some of the discussion reminds me a little of the discussions that we had at the end of
october when we thought that things were improving and then they deteriorated in a way that
had us very concerned  but my central tendency scenario has always been not for a financial
cataclysm although that is certainly a real downside risk but for a sort of slow burn that is just
going to continue to weigh heavily on consumption  i think it is negative feedback between
housing and finance but not necessarily a broader cataclysm  i very much agree with president
evans that the chance of a significant nonlinear break to the downside is not gone but lower than
it has been  but the tightening credit conditions are going to make it very difficult for the
markets to repair and recover as rapidly as perhaps they do in the greenbook
on housing we know there are direct and indirect effects  we have all the signs that the
contraction is continuing  even after housing starts have fallen more than 60 percent we are still
seeing them in near free fall  but that hasnt helped to alleviate the inventories of unsold homes
which remain at extremely elevated levelsalthough not moving up dramatically  part of the
concern is that some of the sales may be due to forced sales related to foreclosures because we
know that foreclosures are up quite a bit  so we have to be a bit cautious there  almost all the
measures suggest that expectations of future housing prices are lower which is causing people to
be very cautious about buying  the anecdotal evidence that i have is that walkthroughs are fine
but that actually closing the deal is much more difficult both because of difficulty in finding
credit and because people are unwilling to make a commitment now  they think that prices may
be 10 percent lower in 6 9 or 12 months  for many people this is the largest investment that
they will make and trying to explain to a loved one that they just lost 10 percent of their nest egg
is not an easy thing to do  so people are being more cautious  we also see some of this in the
abx measures that bill put forward  those numbers have come off their extreme lows but they
are still much lower than they were before  it is hard to believe that the actual default and
delinquency performance will be as bad as those measures are suggesting but they are still
suggesting that things are going to be pretty tough and so we still need to be very wary there
we are still seeing a difference in consumer behaviorpeople being willing to walk
away from their houses before they walk away from their credit cards or from their cars  that is
suggesting that people are just operating somewhat differently from the way they did before
the jumbo spreads are still extremely wide as the charts showed  we may be getting some
offset from the new fha programs and from freddie mac and fannie mae but i am still not
optimistic that much of this can come in before the end of the year  that suggests that we have
tightness on that part  we also have tightness in the credit card market exactly as governor
warsh said  the credit card companies i have spoken to see continuing deterioration  we didnt
see any sort of nonlinear changes but just a continuing downward trend of real challenges and
increasing roll rates of people going 30 60 90 and more days delinquent  spending is up a bit
but they usually say thats mostly because of increases for gasoline and groceries due to the high
commodity prices  also as president yellen mentioned there is more tightening in the heloc
market  more challenges are there so the banks are pulling back and more people are getting
into trouble
i have an anecdote from one of the large companies  a number of large investmentgrade
firms have drawn down significant parts of their revolvers not because they actually needed
them but because they thought that they better do it now before they are pulled back  even these
large institutions seem to be hoarding liquidity much as the banks are doing  i think the banks
are doing that because we still see cds spreads that are very high even though they are lower
than their peaks  the liborois spread that a number of people have mentioned still is high
and is continuing to increase  that is the most troubling for methat we are moving back to the
extreme highs we saw when we had the endoftheyear problem  but then we had an
explanation for its going away  now we dont have an endoftheyear problem so
unfortunately it is difficult for me to understand what is going to make this go away  i think we
can provide more liquidity through some of our various facilities but i am not sure that that in
and of itself will be the cure
we have seen more capital come in and help out some of the institutions  but a lot of
fragility is still there as president pianalto well knows  the issues with respect to national city
were liquidity issues not necessarily shortterm concerns about solvency although i think there
are longerterm concerns about solvency  liquidity and solvency issues are ultimately related
but there is a real concern that many of the money market mutual funds that hold between
3 trillion and 4 trillion will just walk away  we saw this with bear stearns  we can see this
with other institutions  i think that its fragility that accounts for some of these very high levels
we used to worry primarily about deposit runs but deposit runs are extremely slow  deposit
runs are leisurely strolls compared with what could happen in these liquidity markets  so i do
think that issues are there precisely because still more challenges are coming with commercial
real estate construction as a number of other people have mentioned  there will still be a lot of
provisioning that will have to come up putting more pressure on the balance sheets and making
it more difficult for people to borrow  i also very much agree with vice chairman geithner that
the rest of the world is a little behind us and that the boost that we are getting right now from
exports isnt going to persist
turning to inflation as i think a number of people have mentioned we havent seen a lot
of pressure on the labor side  as labor markets soften it is unlikely that we are going to see
more pressure there  so that seems to be a positive  but we do see these very elevated
commodity price levels which dont seem to have fed through to core  but exactly as governor
kohn said it is a bit of a puzzle how they continue to increase and that certainly puts some risks
ahead of us  it is a particularly difficult time to get a good reading on inflation expectations
because there have been lots of changes in liquidity issues and in other particular factors  some
of the surveybased measures are up but they tend to be very closely related to gasoline prices
and we know that those are at extremely high levels  so i think it is extremely difficult for us
now to make a solid determination about where inflation expectations are  certainly that raises a
caution because we dont want to have inflation expectations become unmoored  but i think it is
more difficult for us to identify right now exactly how they are evolving and obviously this will
be important for us in our decisions tomorrow  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  my modal forecast is for a mild recession in
the first half of 2008 and is very much in line with the greenbook forecast  i am more
pessimistic however than the greenbook on the issue of recovery  again the issue is that we
have had a major disruption to our financial markets and there is a mess and i think it is going to
take a long time to clean up the mess  the parallel that president stern made to the episode in
the early 90s is very apt  i suspect that there will be substantial headwinds coming from the
problems in the financial sector for quite a while and that means that the recovery we would see
would be more lshaped than vshaped
when i look at where i was at the last fomc meeting there has really been a big change
for me  i reread the transcripts because you always want to see what things sounded like and i
sounded so depressed then as though i might take out a gun and blow my head off  that is the
way it read  but my sunny optimistic disposition is coming back  laughter  i think it is very
possible that we will look back and say particularly after the bear stearns episode that we have
turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced  i should
mention however that it doesnt mean that we should be complacent  i am not sure that is the
case  we have been disappointed before  but i think there is a very strong possibility that the
worst is over  you can see this in that there is less concern about credit risks in financial
institutions  that is because we had a major institution get into trouble but because of our
actions it didnt blow up the world  there is an issue of course of potential cost and moral
hazard going forward but i think it has had the effect of calming down the markets in a very
substantial way
very important in this regard is that we are seeing that our large financial institutions are
able to raise capital now at not too high a cost  in fact they are doing so in a major way  when
we think about the longterm solution to the problems in the financial markets cleaning up the
mess and raising capital is going to be absolutely critical particularly because in the long run the
securitization market will come back  but it is going to very much involve the large financial
institutions which will have to solve the agency problems that were not solved in this recent
bout of securitization which created all of the problems  so their having enough capital is
critical  i think it is very possible that we are on the path to their sorting out their problems
which in the long run will help sort out the problems in the credit markets
i should mention by the way that i still dont want us to be complacent about this
because things could go in the other direction  there is still the puzzle about what is going on in
the money markets  in particular we see these very large and actually widening spreads between
libor and ois  so even though i am starting to become optimistic i dont want to be
panglossian in my view  from my perspective the key issue is that although my modal forecast
hasnt changed much from march i see that the tail risks have decreased substantially and i
think that the probability that we will have a severe adverse feedback loop which really scared
me just a little while ago is going to be much lower  i still see some downside risks
particularly i am concerned about the issue of housing prices  they could fall more than we and
the greenbook expect and that could trigger some problems  but i do think that the downside
risk is much much lower  another thing i should mention is that i think there is very high
uncertainty right now  so i could get depressed again but we will have to see  i hope not
on the inflation front i see that longrun inflation expectations are still reasonably well
anchored around 2 percent  the information in the financial markets on this score is that there
has not been a big blowout in that case  there have been problems regarding some of the
surveys but i am a little less worried about the surveys in terms of households  i am very
skeptical of them because they tend to react very much to current conditions  also if you ask
people what tv shows they are watching they will tell you that they are watching pbs and
something classy but you know they are watching desperate housewives  laughter
chairman bernanke  what is wrong with desperate housewives  laughter
mr mishkin  but i do have a concern about the risk to inflation expectations because
of the high commodity prices that we see  this is coming from the very adverse supply shock
and the fact that we have had headline inflation so high for so long  the good news by the way
is that it is actually quite remarkable given how high headline inflation has been how anchored
inflation expectations have been  i think that has to do with confidence in this institutions doing
the right thing  it is very important that we retain that confidence  we have to think about that
when we decide what we are going to do regarding policy
about where i think inflation is going to bei have been a 2 percent guy for a long time
i am not changing that  i think that inflation expectations are around 2 percent and that there is
no expectation that we will have excess demand in the economy  if anything it is the opposite of
that  i see the risks as balancedthere are some risks on the upside particularly because of what
is happening with commodity prices  on the other hand there are risks on the downside because
of the expected slack and because there is some downside risk in the economy  so on that
ground i basically have the same story that i had before  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you all for very helpful comments
as usual let me briefly summarize what i heard today and then make a few comments of my
own  again in summary data since the march meeting have been soft and economic activity is
weak  but the recent news has not generally been worse than expected  there was disagreement
over whether we are technically in a recession  most saw improved economic growth in the
second half of 2008 with further improvement in 2009 although some saw moreprotracted
weakness  the housing sector remains weak though there were reports of improvement  starts
and the demand for new houses continue to decline  prices are falling  inventories of unsold
homes remain very high  housing demand is affected by restrictive conditions in mortgage
markets fears that house prices have much further to fall and weakening economic conditions
retail sales sentiment and consumer spending have generally been soft reflecting a long list of
headwinds including tightening credit weaker house prices and higher energy prices  payrolls
are falling although there are some pockets of strength  unemployment is likely to keep rising
it may remain somewhat high into 2010  we will soon see whether the fiscal stimulus package
affects either the consumer or business investment plans  possibly liquidityconstrained
consumers may respond more strongly than normally  business sentiment is also relatively
weak reflecting in part credit conditions but also the uncertain prospects for the economy and
continued cost pressures  investment has softened somewhat including declines in commercial
real estate investment  strength in foreign markets is helping support us production and
profits especially manufacturing although foreign economies may slow in the coming quarters
the energy and agricultural sectors are strong
financial conditions have improved in the past month with financing conditions better
credit risk spreads coming in a bit and both equities and real interest rates up since the last
meeting  decent earnings a sense on the part of some that the bulk of the writedowns in the
banking sector have been taken the ability of financial institutions to raise capital and possibly
fed actions including liquidity provision and the actions regarding bear stearns have
contributed to the improvement  on the other hand many markets remain fragile including the
key interbank market and other shortterm funding markets  some expressed the view that more
significant writedowns and financial stress lie ahead as house prices continue to fall and the
slowing economy weakens credit quality and that the full impact of tighter credit has not yet
been felt in the nonfinancial economy  others however were less concerned about the real
effects of the financial conditions  financial conditions and the housing market probably
remained the most important downside risks to growth although energy prices were also cited
readings on core inflation were moderate in the intermeeting period although some of
the reasons for improvement may be transitory  oil prices have continued to move up
contributing to higher headline inflation  other commodity prices have also begun to rise again
many firms noted these strong cost pressures and indicated some ability to pass those costs along
to consumers  inflation breakevens showed improvement at some horizons since the march
meeting possibly reflecting lower risk premiums though survey inflation expectations were
higher  the dollar appreciated during the intermeeting period but longerterm depreciation and
rising import prices remain another source of pressure on inflation  nominal wage gains remain
moderate however and markups are high  uncertainty about the course of oil and other
commodity prices adds to overall inflation uncertainty and perhaps to inflation risks that are now
somewhat more to the upside  many participants expressed concerns about these upside risks
about inflation expectations and about the maintenance of the feds inflationfighting
credibility  any comments
let me just add a few thoughts to what has already been said  on the real side i think
that i am probably somewhat more pessimistic than the median view that i heard around the
table  first of all i am reasonably confident that we are in a recession  we dont see these
dynamic patterns of employment sentiment and so on without a recession being eventually
called by the nber  that fact i believe raises the risks of morerapid declines in employment
and consumer spending in the months ahead because there seem to be somewhat moreadverse
dynamics in a recession scenario  second i remain concerned about housing which is not
showing really any significant signs of stabilization  mortgage markets are still dysfunctional
and the only source of mortgage credit essentially is the gses which are doing their best to raise
fees and profit from the situation  sales of new homes remain weak  inventories of unsold
homes are down in absolute terms but they still are very high relative to sales  we heard this
morning of yet even faster price declines for housing  as ive said several times at this table
until there is some sense of a bottoming in the housing market and in housing prices i think that
we are not going to see really broad stabilization either in the economy or in financial markets
now there are some positivesexports for examplewhich have kept manufacturing and other
industries from declining as much as usual during a recession  interestingly this could be a
mirror image of the 2001 recession  in 2001 the business sector was weak and consumption
and housing were strong  we could have the mirror image this time
in financial markets there certainly have been improvements and that is certainly
encouraging  i agree with people about that  but we have heard a few people in the market say
that credit losses and writedowns are in the ninth inning  as a baseball fan i think we are
probably closer to the third inning  let me explain why i think that  the imf recently projected
aggregate credit losses on usbased assets of about 945 billion worldwide with about a
quarter of those coming in the us banks and thrifts  the board staff has a somewhat lower
number around 700 billion to 800 billion but they have a higher fraction in us banks and
thrifts  so the basic numbers are pretty similar in that respect  the staff projection for credit
losses for us commercial banks and thrifts excluding investment banks is about 215 billion
for this year and next year and 300 billion if the recession is more severe  in addition the staff
projects about 60 billion in writedowns of cdos and other types of traded assets  now most
of those 60 billion writedowns have been taken  they are mostly held by the top banks and
they have mostly been already written off  however of the 215 billion to 300 billion in
projected credit losses so far us banks and thrifts have acknowledged only about 60 billion
so if you put together those numbers you find that we are about onethird of the way through
total losses
now there are in fact obviously some countervailing factors  banks and thrifts have
already raised about 115 billion in capital since the middle of last year which essentially covers
the losses announced so far  but that said there is still a lot of deleveraging to go  there is
going to be a long process of selling assets reducing extensions of credit and building capital
ratios  this may not yet be fully felt in the real economy but it will eventually be there  so i do
think that we are going to see continued pressure from financial markets and credit markets even
if we dont have any serious relapses into financial stress  so again i am somewhat more
skeptical about a nearterm improvement in economic growth although i do acknowledge that
the fiscal package and other factors that the greenbook mentions will be helpful
the question has been raised about whether monetary policy is helpful and what the
stance of monetary policy is  i agree with the comment that the real federal funds rate is not
necessarily the best measure of the stance of monetary policy right now  let me take an example
that was given in the new york feds daily financial report a couple of days ago which was
about the allin cost of assetbacked securities backed by auto loans  according to this report in
february of 07 the threeyear swap rate was about 5 percent and the spread on aaa tranches
of autobacked abs was about 10 basis points  the allin cost was 507 percent for this
particular asset  in february of 08 the threeyear swap rate was 315 percent almost 2
percentage points lower but the spread on aaa tranches was 195 basis points  therefore the
overall allin cost of auto loan abs was 536 percent  so the net effect iswell is monetary
policy doing anything  absolutely  we have reduced the safe rate  we have brought down the
cost of funds  but the spreads have obviously offset that  so what we have really done is
essentially offset the effects of the credit crisis  obviously if we had not responded to the
situation those costs would be much higher and the extent of restriction would be a lot greater
for these reasons i really do believe that we need to take a much more sophisticated look at
what the appropriate interest rate is  the taylor rules in particular are just not appropriate for
the current situation because the equilibrium real interest rate of 2 percent that is built into them
is not necessarily appropriate
let me turn to inflation which a lot of people talked about today  first let me just say
that i certainly have significant concerns on the nominal side  in particular i have a lot of
anxiety about the dollar  foreign exchange rates in general are not well tied down and they are
very subject to sentiment and swings in views  therefore although i think that the depreciation
of the dollar so far is a mixed bagobviously it has effects on different parts of the economyi
do think that there is a risk of a sharper fall with possibly adverse implications in the short run
for us assets and in the long run perhaps implications for our position as a reserve currency
and so on  so i think that is an issue to be concerned about  for that reason and for other
reasons as well i am very sympathetic to the view i hear around the table that we are now very
very close to where we ought to be that it is time to take a rest to see the effects of our work
and to pay equal attention to the nominal side of our mandate  i agree with all of that  so i am
hopeful that in our policy discussion tomorrow we will be fairly close around the table
that being said i do want to take a little exception to some of the discussion about
inflation  there is an obvious and very elementary distinction between relative price changes
and overall inflation  let me ask you to do the following thought experiment  imagine you are
speaking to your board  last year as a first approximation headline inflation was 4 percent
labor compensation grew at 4 percent and oil prices rose 60 percent  lets imagine that we had
been so farsighted and so effective that we managed to keep headline inflation last year at
2 percent  the implications would have been assuming that relative price changes were the
same that wages would have grown at 2 percent and that oil prices would have risen at
57 percent  in the conversation with your board your board would say this inflation is killing
us  these costs are killing us  we have to pass them through  they would and they would be
right  when there are big changes in relative prices that is a real phenomenon and it has to be
accommodated somehow by nominal price shifts  so to the extent that the changes in food and
oil prices reflect real supplyanddemand conditions obviously they are very distressing and bad
for the economy and create a lot of pain but they are not in themselves necessarily under the
control of monetary policy  if we give the impression that gasoline prices are the feds
responsibility we are looking for trouble because we cannot control gasoline prices  that said
of course we need to address the overall inflation rate  we need to address inflation
expectations  all of that is very important  but again we need to make a distinction between
relative price changes and overall inflation
now a more sophisticated response to that is well maybe monetary policy is
contributing to these relative price changes as well and i think that is a very serious issue
certainly the dollar has some effects on oil prices  but keep in mind that a lot of the depreciation
of the dollar is a decline in real exchange rates which is essential in any case for balancing our
external accounts  so yes the depreciation of the dollar through our policies has contributed
somewhat to commodity prices  but compared with the overall shifts in relative prices that we
have seen i think it is not that large  there are other hypotheses suggesting that we have been
stimulating speculation in a bubble suggesting that low real interest rates contribute to
commodity price booms  i dont want to take more time but the evidence for those things is
very limited  in particular the fact that we have not seen any buildups in hoarding or inventories
is a very strong argument against the idea that inflation expectations hoarding or speculation is
a major factor in energy price increases  so yes the nominal side is very important  we need to
address that  i agree with that  but we should try to help our audiences understand the very
important distinction between real and nominal changes
i think i will stop there  if i can ask for your patience we could do the briefing on the
alternatives today and give ourselves more time tomorrow  around the table does that seem
okay  ill call on bill english
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman i was wondering if brian or bill
wanted to talk president plosser out of his concern about mzm at some point
mr madigan  if you like i could try to address that tomorrow
chairman bernanke  well have a special session on mzm  laughter
mr english3  i will be referring to the revised version of table 1 which is included in the package labeled material for the fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  the revised table presents the same range of options regarding the target federal funds rate as the version discussed in the bluebook but we have proposed some changes to the statement language for alternatives b and c  new language introduced in the draft distributed on monday is shown in blue with language reintroduced from the march 18 statement shown in black and underlined
an additional adjustment made since monday is shown in purple  laughter  we have about used up the color palette in word  i will discuss these changes as i go along
your policy decision at this meeting would seem to depend on three judgments where do you think you are where do you want to be and what path do you want to follow to get there  the staffs assessment of where you areat least in terms of the stance of monetary policyis summarized in the r chart that was included in the bluebook  that chart showed that the current real federal funds rate is about 50 basis points above the greenbookconsistent measure of r suggesting that the rapid easing of policy this year has left the real funds rate fairly close to the level required to bring the economy back to its potential over the medium term  the low level of the

3  the materials used by mr english are appended to this transcript appendix 3
equilibrium funds rate reflects the staffs judgment that the housing correction and financial market stresseswith their associated effects on consumer and business confidencehave been sufficient to shift the economy into a recession regime in which spending by both households and businesses is likely to be weak  as for where you want to be the greenbook projection assumes that the real funds rate is moved down to its equilibrium levelthat is the federal funds rate is trimmed 50 basis points furtherand then remains unchanged over the rest of the projection period
finally as for the path you want to follow to get there the staff projection assumes that you move the federal funds rate to the staffs estimate of the rates equilibrium level relatively quickly by trimming the fed funds target 25 basis points at this meeting and another 25 basis points at the june meeting  however there is no overshoot below the equilibrium level in order to provide insurance against a further unexpected slide in spending
if you agree with the staff that about 50 basis points of additional easing is needed to bring the real federal funds rate into alignment with its equilibrium level and you are at least moderately confident of that assessment then you might be inclined to ease policy by 50 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement suggesting fairly balanced risks to the outlook as in alternative a  a relatively large adjustment to policy at this meeting would be particularly attractive if the committee wanted a somewhat faster recovery in output or was concerned about downside risks to growth and wished to move the funds rate back to its equilibrium value quickly in order to help head them off  members might also select a larger rate cut if they were willing to live with somewhat higher inflation over time as in the optimal control simulation in the bluebook with an inflation goal of 2 percent
the rationale language proposed for alternative a sticks fairly closely to the language used in march making modest adjustments that are intended to avoid leaving the impression that the weakness in economic activity or the concerns about inflation had worsened appreciably over the intermeeting period  the assessmentof risk language would continue to indicate that the easier stance of policy should foster moderate growth over time and    mitigate the risks to economic activity but it would move toward balance by dropping the explicit reference to downside risks  as in march it would end by promising timely action to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
investors would be surprised by the adoption of alternative a  market participants generally expect a 25 basis point rate cut at this meeting and put very low odds on a 50 basis point cut  however the effect of the relatively large easing would be damped somewhat by the shift to a more balanced risk assessment  the result would likely be lower short and intermediateterm interest rates a rise in equity prices and a softening of the dollar
if the committee viewed the target federal funds rate as probably close to the level that would appropriately balance the risks to its dual objectives but saw considerable uncertainty regarding that level then it might be inclined to reduce the
funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and suggest a more gradual pace of policy easing or even a pause after this meeting as in alternative b  policy has been eased very rapidly and it is difficult at this point to assess the extent to which that easing has been transmitted to households and firms and so to spending  that assessment is complicated by the ongoing turbulence in financial markets as well as the usual difficulty in extracting signals from noisy data on economic activity
against this backdrop the committee may be inclined to take a relatively small policy step at this meeting and then move to a more incremental policy approach under which policy will be guided by incoming information on economic and financial developments  moreover with some measures of longterm inflation expectations having moved higher in recent months members may be concerned that a larger policy move at this meeting would encourage the view that the committee is more willing to tolerate inflation than had been thought  by taking a smaller policy step at this meeting and suggesting reduced odds of additional nearterm policy action the committee could limit the extent to which investors extrapolate the recent large policy moves and so build into asset prices more easing than is warranted  such a brake on expectations may be seen as particularly useful since the incoming data on employment and economic activity are likely to be pretty soft in the near term and the data releases could well spur expectations of further rate cuts even though the committee anticipated the weakness when setting policy  communication on this point will presumably be enhanced by the release of the summary of economic projections in three weeks which should clarify the committees views on the appropriate path for policy and the expected trajectory for economic growth over coming quarters
in the bluebook the rationale portion of the statement associated with alternative b was identical to that under alternative a  however in the revised version of
table 1 the first sentence on inflation has been changed to acknowledge the recent improvement in readings on core inflation but point to the continued runup in energy and other commodity prices  rather than simply noting the committees judgment that a further easing move is appropriate as in alternative a the assessmentofrisk paragraph begins by stating that the substantial easing of monetary policy to date combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity  the explicit timedependent pause that was suggested in the bluebook formulation for this alternative has been replaced by wording that is intended to suggest that policy will be more datadependent with the final sentence now reading the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability  the addition of the phrase on monitoring developments coupled with the deletion of the indication in the march statement that the committee will act in a timely manner will likely be read by investors as suggesting a slowing in the pace of easing and possibly a pause after this meeting if the economy develops as the committee anticipates
investors appear to expect that the committee will trim the federal funds rate
25 basis points at this meeting and then leave the federal funds target at 2 percent for
some time  the 25 basis point policy easing and the associated statement under alternative b would seem to be about in line with these expectations implying little response in financial markets
if the committee thinks that the substantial easing of policy already put in place along with the coming fiscal stimulus is likely to foster outcomes that appropriately balance its inflation and growth objectives then it may want to stay its hand at this meeting and issue a statement suggesting that policy is likely to change gradually going forward and could even be on hold for a time as in alternative c  the committee may expect the ongoing weakness in spending to be relatively mild and brief  the real federal funds rate is already very low and the incoming data may not be seen as sufficiently weak to confirm the staffs view that the economy has shifted to a recessionary footing and therefore that spending is likely to come in weaker than one would otherwise expect  with financial markets most recently improving on balance and investors apparently less concerned about tail events the committee may see smaller downside risks to the outlook for growth  at the same time members may think that the inflation outlook remains worrisome  prices of oil and some other commodities touched new highs over the intermeeting period and members may anticipate that firms will be able to pass a larger share of the increase in these costs through to their customers than the staff anticipates  longerterm inflation expectations may have increased in recent months and the committee might be concerned that failing to push back at least modestly against that rise could allow for a more significant increase in expectations that could be very costly to reverse
moreover some members may worry that additional policy easing could trigger declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and increases in commodity prices that would give a further boost to inflationary pressures  taken together these arguments might suggest that if a further easing step were taken at this meeting it might have to be reversed fairly soonan outcome that some members may wish to avoid
the discussion of economic activity in the statement under alternative c is identical to that under the other two alternatives  the inflation paragraph is similar to that under alternative a but it does not list the reasons for the anticipated moderation in inflation  the exclusion of this list is intended to suggest less confidence in the judgment that inflation will moderate as expected  some members may also be uncomfortable repeating the reference to a projected levelingout of energy and other commodity prices when those prices have surprised to the upside yet again
the assessmentofrisk portion of the statement starts by pointing to downside risks but then proceeds as in alternative b  the reference to downside risks might counter to some degree the suggestion of a possible pause in the easing process but the lack of policy action combined with this statement language would presumably limit expectations for easing at coming meetings
market participants put only about onequarter odds on unchanged policy at this meeting and so the combination of unchanged policy and a statement suggesting that the committee could remain on hold for a time would surprise investors even with
the retention of downside risks to growth  short and intermediateterm rates would rise stock prices would likely fall and the dollar could rally  effects on longerterm rates and also on inflation compensation would depend on whether investors interpreted the statement as indicating that the committee desired a lower level of inflation than had been thought  the unexpectedly firm policy decision could boost pressures in shortterm funding markets either immediately as a result of higher funding costs for leveraged firms and a weaker outlook for the real economy or over time in the event that economic data came in weaker than anticipated and the fomc was seen as less likely to ease policy in response  that concludes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for bill
mr fisher  mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  you emphasized the phrase reflecting a projected levelingout of energy
and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization  can you just
refresh my memory  for how long have we been using that phrasejust in the march
statement or have we used it before
mr english  im afraid im not sure
mr madigan  we must have used that just in march  it was not here in january
vice chairman geithner  definitely march  january was minimalist
mr fisher  so not in januaryit was just in march that we used that  second lets
say we were to have a rally in the dollar  if we voted for no change might that positively affect
equity prices or the credit markets in the united states  is it possible
mr english  i suppose its possible but i guess i would expect that if monetary
policy came out tighter than people had expected it would lead to at least a modest marking
down of the outlook for the economy
mr fisher  for how long  this is a personal view but its not clear to me that things
are that clearcut on a sustainable basis  one of the things that seems to be undercutting
confidence is the weakness in the dollar even though in the past few days the dollar has rallied
im just wondering if its clearcut that we would necessarily have a sustained selloff  i can see
an immediate reaction particularly on the announcement  but its conceivable is it not that if
we had a dollar rally that we could have a positive effect on equity prices or on the credit
markets
mr english  i think its hard to know how people would read the news  but as was
emphasized earlier a weaker dollar supports exports and supports the outlook for the real
economy
chairman bernanke  bill dudley
mr dudley  i think you could get your result if people took the action as that the
federal reserves view was that the economy wasnt as great a risk  so risk premiums would
come down the dollar would rally and the stock market would do better  i mean its possible
vice chairman geithner  this speculation is perilous
mr fisher  yes  i just wanted to ask a question
vice chairman geithner  but i think it goes exactly to what both bills just said
in that it depends fundamentally on whether the disappointment is reassuring or troubling  we
have had two examples of disappointment that have been troubling and we have had one
example of disappointment being reassuringthe most recent one being the latter  so i think
what matters most is what happens to the expected path of the fed funds rate going forward and
that is how you would know  if you disappoint significantly and the markets lower the expected
path going forward as they did in october and december you could have the dollar weaken as a
result just as easily as strengthen  we are not very good at speculating about the effect on the fed
funds rate expectations of our statements and it is much harder to speculate about the effect on
the dollar in this context  you can tell a compelling story on both sides  it sort of depends how
plausible it is particularly if you have language saying that downside risks to growth remain
even without moving that we are signaling greater confidence in the strength of the economy
going forward with an action that implies not moving
mr dudley  it is also being significantly driven by the subsequent data
mr fisher  well this just illustrates the point  its not as clearcut as one might
guess  thank you
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i have a couple of questions unfortunately  i
am very sympathetic to your point about how difficult it is to understand what the relationship is
between the equilibrium fed funds rate and where we are with respect to financial stress
actually my question is for the greenbook teamif you could remind me again within the
greenbookconsistent measure how do you deal with these  you have add factors in your
forecast  presumably theyre related to the financial stress  i know that they are acting as if
there is a higher interest rate at work  we also have the role of the lending facilities which
perhaps have relieved a bit of that stress  i am not quite sure how that plays out here so if you
could please clarify that as best you can  again in chart 6 there is no role for the inflation
preference right  this is all about how long it takes to get back to potential over three years
with this interest rate  the board staff was very helpful over the weekend when i asked a
question about chart 7 and the fact that the funds rate took off from a higher level  if you add
that type of analysis in there it seems as if it comes down a little to what your inflation
preference is  for the 1 percent inflation rate you might want to stick where you are if its
2 percent you would move down a bit  again that is taking it as given that you can interpret
these at face value if you will
i have another question about the fed funds futures market and bill dudleys chart about
how the dealers seem to have slightly different expectations and whether or not that teases out
anything about what governor kohn was talking about because thats a very interesting
observation  you know there is much more weight below the market
mr dudley  yes its hard to know what to read into that  it could be that the
forecasts have more inertia to them
mr evans  oh  i thought these were the smart guys who really were on top of it
mr dudley  but forecasts dont change that fast so it is hard to know but that could
be one factor
chairman bernanke  dave did you want to respond
mr stockton  yes  first you are absolutely right  the equilibrium funds rate
calculation has no reference to inflation  it shouldnt be viewed as a policy recommendation or
where the fed funds rate should be  in essence it is one transformation of the is curve
interacting with the supply side of the economyset the real funds rate at that level and it is
designed to deliver the return of the economy to potential in 12 quarters
now as for the way that we have treated financial stress and its effect on the equilibrium
funds rate we have marked down our estimate of the equilibrium funds rate a huge amount since
last august  a couple of those big steps really were putting in add factors for our sense of the
extent to which financial turbulence and stress were going to depress aggregate spending going
forward  how do we get that  we have taken some of these principal component measures of
financial stressin some cases principal components of the senior loan officer opinion
surveyand regressed those on the errors in the spending equations and observed that there is a
pretty high correlation between those measures and our spending errors  weve tried as best we
could to build that correlation into our spending forecast so that when we calculate the
equilibrium funds rate it reflects a much weaker level of spending for any given funds rate than
you otherwise would have observed  the adjustments show up as a lower equilibrium funds
rate
the second factor that is currently depressing our estimate of the equilibrium funds rate is
indirectly related to financial stress  but in the last forecast when we shifted to this recession
like scenario we incorporated additional negative add factors on spending to reflect the
observation that when we are in a cyclical downturn there tend to be correlated errors across
these equations that are related to the cyclical event  that was a second factor that was leading
to the very low estimate of the funds rate  so those are as best as we could incorporated in
those measures  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin first and then president bullard
mr mishkin  is yours on this point
mr bullard  its related to this
mr mishkin  then why dont you take my slot and ill come in after
mr bullard  is it a regimeswitching kind of model in which you enter the
recession stateyou call it the recession stateand then addfactor down further
mr stockton  yes though that may be putting it too scientifically  in essence we
were looking at a configuration of data that at the time of the march meeting appeared to
indicate recession  even though we did not have the spending data in handand as governor
kohn indicated we still havent seen these correlated negative errors on spending yetwe had
seen enough other signals in terms of the business and consumer sentiment surveys the rise in
the initial claims for unemployment insurance and the jump in the unemployment rate that
taken together suggested to us that there was a likelihood that we were or would be in a
recession scenario  we then added in more negative add factors to account for that
mr bullard  then is that calibrated against the 199091 recession or the 2001
recession
mr stockton  basically we did an average of the residuals in recessions since
1970
mr bullard  oh is 198082 in there
mr stockton  yes 198082 is in there  again the composition of where these
residuals are is obviously heavily tilted in this case to housing some of which is already behind
us  so it isnt quite as though all of this weakness is prospective  some of this weakness we
have already had and so there are very big negative residuals now on housing relative to where
you would otherwise have been
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  just to ask bill a questionfirst the tall bill but the shorter bill can
answer afterward  laughter  on alternative b you indicated that this would be very much in
line with market expectations and therefore shouldnt have much impact  i was wondering
about the statement aspect in particular the assessmentofrisk part because this is not just
saying that we are doing 25 basis points it is also saying that we are now in a different mode of
operation regarding the cycle  so where do you think the markets are concerning where the
statement would be in this regard
mr english  in recent days the stories we have been hearing from market
participants and observers are that they think there may well be somethingmaybe not signaling
strongly that were done but talking about slowing down or possibly a pause  so i think this
really is pretty close to what is built in
mr dudley  yes a soft pause rather than a hard pause is the way i would think about
what the market is looking for
mr mishkin  okay  good  thank you
chairman bernanke  other questions for bill  all right  well we have
overnight to reflect  we will also have the gdp data in the morning  im sure that they will be
informative  we will reconvene tomorrow at 900 am  there is a dinner and reception for
those of you who would like to attend and well see you there
meeting recessed
april 30 2008morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  why dont we start with the
report from dave stockton on the data
mr stockton4  we left at your place and i hope you have found a gdp advance
release for the first quarter  it came in at plus 06 percent versus our greenbook forecast of 04
it was really very close to our expectations both for the total and for the individual components
there were a few small differences  nonresidential structures as you can see about halfway
down that sheet are estimated to have been weaker than we were forecasting  i think that
additional weakness certainly reinforces the story i was telling yesterday about this being an area
in which we are now seeing more convincing signs of softness  residential investment was not
quite as weak as we thought but i dont think the difference between a minus 27 and a minus 31
changes the basic tenor of that particular story  two small areas for which we had some upside
surprises were federal spending and inventory investment but those surprises were really quite
small  i dont see anything in this report quite frankly on the real gdp side that would cause us
to change our basic outlook  obviously when we get the detail we might make some minor
adjustments to the secondquarter forecast  as for prices the final two lines of that table total
pce came in right as we had expected  core pce was estimated by the bea to be a tenth higher
than we had projected but that is still  percentage point below what we were projecting back in
the march greenbook  so again i dont think that the report that i gave yesterday would be
altered by this release
we also received the employment cost index  in the release we get those figures only to
one decimal place  to one decimal place we are right on for total compensationwages and
salaries and benefits in terms of the 12month change it was 32 percent and that was what we

4  the materials used by mr stockton are appended to this transcript appendix 4
were forecasting  wages were a bit higher than we thought32 versus the 31 we projected
but benefits came in a little lower than we were projecting  there again i think the data just
basically confirm the story that we are not really yet seeing any signs of pressure on the labor
cost side
chairman bernanke  any questions for dave  all right  if not yesterday we
had an introductory presentation by bill english on the alternatives  you will be pleased to
know that there have been no further changes in the proposed statements  so why dont we take
comments now from the participants  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  what i would like to doit will probably
come as no surpriseis to make the case for why we should stand pat today and make no
change  my case is built on a number of points and id like to articulate those as best i can
first as we all know the economic outlook has weakened since the start of the year but
that deterioration occurred largely between january and march  since the march meeting there
has been little change in the greenbook forecast or in my own outlook for the economy
incoming data over the intermeeting period are consistent with a weak first half but not
appreciably weaker than we earlier anticipated  i believe that easing policy is appropriate in a
weaker economy but continuing to cut rates for as long as the economy remains weak is not
appropriate  although it is a difficult task we must try to calibrate the appropriate level of the
fed funds rate with the economic prospects and our policy goals  i will just note that since last
september we have lowered the funds rate 300 basis points  this year alone in a period of less
than 60 days we have cut 200 basis points  this is a very aggressive policy of easing  not
enough time has passed in my view to see the full effect on the economy of those cuts and a
further 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point will do nothing to change the nearterm
outlook of the economy
second we are currently running a very accommodative monetary policy no matter how
you look at it  the real funds rate is negative or very negative depending on which measures of
inflation you use to construct it  the nominal funds rate is below the level of most versions of
the taylor rule even when adjusting for some interest rate and real rate effects given our
objectives  as i noted yesterday monetary aggregates as measured by m2 and to some extent
mzm have expanded very rapidly especially since our rate cuts in late january  now although
none of these measures of monetary accommodation or monetary ease is perfecteach has its
drawbacksi am concerned that all the measures of monetary accommodation suggest that we
are very accommodative at the current time
third inflation is high unacceptably high in my view and has been that way for a
sustained period as i talked about yesterday  some would argue that the weakened economy
will bring the inflation rate down  but theory and experience both say that such will occur only
if expectations of inflation remain anchored  but since the end of last year most measures of
expected inflation have moved up  the instability in the measures of expected inflation is a
cause for concern  it suggests to me that markets may be less convinced of our willingness to
take the necessary actions that are consistent with sustaining a credible commitment to price
stability  i certainly understand the difference between a relative price shock and inflation
clearly oil prices and other commodity prices are in part a relative price shock  there is no
question about that  but it is also true that in the 1970s one of our mistakes was that we
accommodated relative price shocks with very accommodative monetary policy and in so doing
helped convert a relative price shock into sustained inflation  i think we should be careful not to
fall into the same trap  besides i think that in most monetary models today we worry
particularly about stabilizing core inflation because it represents the sticky prices in our sticky
price models  so if relative price shocks begin to seep into the core or into the stickyprice
elements monetary theory would suggest that we need to respond to those  if we are going to
achieve something close to optimal monetary policy we should be concerned about that seepage
because it may affect expectations and it is part of what monetary policy should be doing at least
in that class of models
although it is true that we have not seen much in the way of wage inflation to date and
that is encouraging i would also reiterate as some people noted yesterday that wage inflation
tends to be a lagging not a leading indicator of overall inflation  contrary to the greenbook
forecast which has us maintaining a negative real funds rate for two years and inflation coming
down i think that if we continue easing or maintain the real funds rate well below zero for a
period of time despite inflation well above our goal it is reasonable to assume that expectations
will not remain anchored  the fomcs stated goal of price stability cannot remain credible
independent of our actions  if we want expectations to remain well anchored we have to act in a
way that is consistent with that
fourth i believe that we are in the fortunate position today of being able to pause
market participants have reacted to the incoming data by appreciably tightening their
expectations of future funds rate movesat least as measured by the futures markets as we have
seen  participants seem to be getting less comfortable with the idea of very easy monetary policy
over a sustained period given the outlook for inflation  i note that the markets reassessment of
their policy expectations over the intermeeting period doesnt appear to have had any significant
negative effect on the markets or the economy more broadly during this period  i think this
reassessment by the markets presents us with an opportunity to reinforce our stated commitment
to price stability not just with words but with action or in this case inaction  i think a pause
today would send a strong signal of our commitment to price stability which could further help
anchor inflation expectations which i consider to be very fragile  a pause it seems to me
balances the risks of the two parts of our mandate  some might argue that in the midst of the
financial market disruptions that we have seen this year it is important for the fed not to add to
market turmoil by taking policy actions not anticipated by the markets  the mean expectation
for the markets is for 25 basis points of easing today  but market participants are placing odds of
somewhere between 25 percent and 30 percent on our pausing so i dont think a pause would be
very disruptive to the markets  the magnitude of the surprise would be about the same as the
surprise we had last time when we cut 75 basis points  that surprise in my view did not really
cause much turmoil in the marketplace
finally when i say that cutting 25 basis points wont help the outlook for the economy
very much others might respond that cutting 25 basis points wont hurt it very much either so
why not  i disagree  i think a cut today will not be a disaster but will contribute to a further
eroding of our credibility in the eyes of the public  at past meetings this committee has spoken
a lot about the need for rapid reversals of our rate cuts that we took out for insurance  i think we
should not be overly confident of our ability to implement such rapid reversals  in fact the
lower the rates go the further we will need to come back when we start taking the
accommodation back  i am dubious of our ability because we will be so much further from what
might be a more neutral rate
in summary to my mind the gain in credibility from pausing today substantially
outweighs any negative effects from slightly disappointing the markets  it doesnt preclude us
from choosing to resume cuts at a later date should economic conditions warrant them  after all
i think this committee has demonstrated its ability to act aggressively in response to economic
conditions and we can do so again  but that is the future  for today i think we should take the
opportunity that the economy and the markets have afforded us to pause  as the old latin
expression says carpe diem
with regard to language i am happy with alternative c  rather than the language in
paragraph 4 of alternative c i would prefer the language of paragraph 4 of alternative b  i
would just make that the language for paragraph 4 in alternative cthat is the only change that i
think would be necessary  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i too favor maintaining the federal funds rate
at 2 percent today  the current real interest rate provides accommodative monetary conditions
for an economy that is struggling near recession or is in mild recession  our lending facilities are
probably doing as much as can be expected to mitigate the serious and necessary financial
adjustments that must be accomplished by the private markets  if the economy takes another
serious leg down our current funds rate setting is well positioned for us to respond promptly
appropriately and aggressively if circumstances warrant  a pause today affords us a unique
opportunity to wait and see how our recent aggressive actions are influencing the trajectory of
real activity  since markets are putting substantial weight on a 25 basis point easing today a
pause will be a relatively small disappointment  as president plosser pointed out that was
similar to our march disappointment which seemed to be all right  i think it is important for us
to understand how the economy will respond to a pause in ratecutting when it does occur  with
high food energy and commodity prices the extended positive differential of headline inflation
over core measures risks an increase in the publics inflation expectations  i agree with president
plossers discussion of relative prices on that front
from a longerterm perspective which we dont really talk about very often i worry
about the asymmetric response of policy to high inflation as opposed to when it is low  when
headline inflation is above core inflation we take on board the relative price adjustment and
then we are content i would guess to bring inflation down to our perceived inflation targets
but on the downside when inflation gets low we become uncomfortable with certain low
inflation settings and so i fear that we would respond more aggressively as we did in 2003
which really was a positive productivity environment  if you have an asymmetric type of
response you are going to take on board increases in the price level because of that asymmetry
thats one reason that i am concerned about these types of behaviors  although i expect
emerging resource slack to temper any adverse inflation developments the risk is simply
growing in importance with every additional policy easing compared with the economic risks
which presumably are abating as we respond to them with such easings
calibrating the current policy stance against these divergent economic and inflation risks
is important and challenging as you pointed out yesterday mr chairman  i think that
comparisons to the rate troughs in the previous cycles of recession policy are instructive  the
current real fed funds rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of zero or it could be lower if you
choose a different way to deflate the funds rate by total inflation  i was very impressed with
dave stocktons response to my question about what types of factors from financial market
stress are embodied in the greenbookconsistent real interest rate  it seems as though a
tremendous amount of care has been taken to introduce some of these special factors in
innovative ways and while they may not capture all facets of that i thought that they did quite a
good job  so i feel a bit more comfortable in making those comparisons but i do recognize that
it is a treacherous period
that said this is about the same place the real funds rate bottomed out during the jobless
recovery with financial headwinds in the 199091 recession and with the data we had in hand at
the time during the disinflation concerns in 2003  both periods were unique in suggesting a high
degree of accommodation and the factors that were at work in each of those episodes were
unique  our attempt to incorporate these factors has been quite useful and so its a reasonable if
not definitive comparison  with our current lending facilities addressing financial stress i think
our current policy accommodation now at 2 percent is appropriately similar to those episodes
my final observation has to do with these endofcycle expectations and what they might
mean for longterm interest rates  if 25 basis points is viewed as additional insurance against
downside risks i just dont think this action is significant enough to have much of an effect  we
expect to take back some portion of the aggressive cuts especially the ones that have been an
attempt to respond to the financial stress  if the financial stress is mitigated to some extent we
should be expected to take that back  expectations as in the fed funds futures market should
limit the effect of those actions on longterm interest rates  after all by the expectations
hypothesis you are going to be averaging these shortterm paths into longterm rates  that is
one reason that the committee injected the language considerable period back in 2003 to try
to convince people that we would do this for a longer period of time and affect longterm rates
so if there is an expectation of some type of rebound these last insurance cuts might not have
that large an effect  again i think our lending facilities are better geared for the financial stress
i think we have clearly demonstrated our willingness to provide appropriately
accommodative policies in a timely fashion when the economic situation demanded it  for me
the publics expectation of these actions in that event argues against one further small insurance
move  because we are concerned about inflation risks and have indicated that we must flexibly
move toward moreneutral policy stances once the economy and financial markets improve a
pause today is a small down payment on those difficult future actions  in terms of language if it
came to that i would be comfortable with the language of alternative b with this particular rate
action  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i must say that i am sympathetic to the
hold advocates and the view that we are already accommodative  i think an apt anecdote is a
conversation i had in the past six weeks with a cruise line ceo who doesnt know how to drive
his ships but who has in fact been at the helm a couple of times  he said when you turn the
wheel and nothing happens for several miles the temptation to keep turning the wheel is
overwhelming  laughter  so i do have some sympathy  that said i am going to support a
reduction in the target rate of  percent effectively alternative b as i indicated yesterday  i
think it is pretty clear that we have a tradeoff between a little more help to the economy and
enough for now and really some shift in our focus to combating inflation
so let me lay out my rationale for not holding  i think there is still substantial downside
risk to the general economy and it may take quite some time for recovery to materialize  a
quarter would help slightly to effect a lower cost of borrowing and therefore would stimulate
activity although much of that is really beyond our control  it will be dictated by market forces
i think that halting today versus conceivably halting at the next meeting risks some interpretation
as a lack of recognition of the real state of weakness in the economy
regarding inflation i think the core numbers in the first quarter were not overly
discouraging and i have to believe my own forecastsin many respects the forecasts i heard
that inflation will soften in the coming months and be consistent with our working view of
expectations  i would say however that i am concerned that in the minds of the general public
high prices actually translate into inflation whether or not the rate of inflation has flattened
as i have suggested i am inclined to pause after this move provided that the incoming
data are not too adverse and too divergent from expectations but with the caveat that i think a lot
of shock risk is still out there and we have to remain flexible to deal with surprises  holding or
signaling a pause may help the housing market a bit by starting to construct a bottom as
borrowers or buyers begin to perceive that they shouldnt expect any further rate cuts from us
regarding the statement i think the rationale section in alternative b is appropriate to the
situation that we face  section 3 is a realistic acknowledgement of inflation trends and risk  i
gather that with the changes in section 4 the question was whether or not to signal a pause or an
inclination to pause and i tend to agree with a more cautious less committal approach of the
proposed languagewhat yesterday was called a soft pause  so i am on balance quite happy
with the language in alternative b  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well i have given serious consideration to
both alternatives b and c and i think a credible case can be made for either one  there are of
course risks associated with adopting either one as well  on balance i come out in favor of
alternative b for the following reasons  first we are certainly not yet out of the economic
woods  although my forecast is for a relatively mild recession i would not be particularly
surprised if it turned out to be both deeper and more prolonged given among other things the
persistent overhang of unoccupied unsold homes and the severity of the financial dislocations of
the past nine months  as i have tried to emphasize i think it could be dangerous to
underestimate the effects of the financial headwinds now in train and likely in my judgment to
get more severe  second and closely related to those observations financial conditions remain
quite sensitive  even if improvement is now under way in some markets i think it will be some
time as i said yesterday before credit conditions are fully supportive of economic growth  to
amplify a bit i think we need to be a bit careful about the weight we put on the low level of the
real federal funds rate per se for as governor kohn pointed out yesterday the credit situation is
a good deal more complicated than that
my principal reservation about supporting alternative b has to do with the inflation
outlook  the news here has not been uniformly bad especially with regard to core inflation but
i am not convinced that inflation will abate in a timely way without policy action  on the other
hand i take some comfort from the fact that apparently financial market participants do not
anticipate further reductions in the federal funds rate target beyond this meeting  i think the
language associated with alternative b should help to reinforce the view that at a minimum a
pause in the reductions in the target is not that far off given what we know today  i think it
important that we find opportunities to bolster that view when we can  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  there seems to be a groundswell of
opinion in financial markets and perhaps around this table that given the easing to date we are
at or close to a point where we should pause and assess the impact of both fiscal and monetary
stimulus already provided  should we pause at a fed funds rate below 2 percent at 2 percent or
over 2 percent  the greenbook forecast assumes that we pause at 1 percent  with this degree
of stimulus core and total pce inflation is at or below 2 percent in 2009 but the unemployment
rate remains well above the nairu even at the end of 2010  the boston forecast generates
similar outcomes  the greenbook and the boston forecasts suggest that 25 basis points at this
meeting may not be enough  both forecasts imply that a significant degree of slack remains in
the economy even with a 25 basis point reduction at both this and the following meeting  in
addition there are significant downside risks to the outlook  falling asset prices in other
countries have frequently been accompanied by prolonged periods of weakness  finally given
the rise we have seen in the libor rate for many borrowers a 25 basis point decrease leaves
policy no more accommodative than at our last meeting
the consensus seems to be that we should be moving in smaller increments  but if we
choose option b it is not at all clear to me that we should pause after this meeting  in that
regard i was happy to see the revised language in the bluebook table 1 which does not imply
that our easing cycle has definitely ended  while i hope that the economy recovers sufficiently
that further easing is not necessary we need to remain flexible particularly given that our
models indicate that even with further easing we are likely to experience several years of
elevated unemployment rates  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think i can be brief by just associating myself
with the comments of president stern  this is a difficult decision  you could make a case for
either of these  but on balance i think we should be lowering interest rates 25 basis points as
under alternative b  as president stern said i dont think just subtracting past inflation from the
nominal federal funds rate is a good metric for where the stance of policy is today  it would be if
financial conditions were consistent with historical relationships but theyre not  we have very
tight credit conditions in many sectors of the market and a zero or negative federal funds rate
means a very different thing today than it did even in the early 1990s gary because then you
had the banking system broken but the securities markets working  now you have the banking
system broken and the securities markets not working very well  so i think we have strongeri
guess greenspan called them 50 mile an hourheadwinds  i would say they are 60 or 70
today at least for now
we expect the headwinds to abate and as they abate policy will look a lot more
accommodative  but i dont think we really have insurance right now against the contingency
that the headwinds dont abate very quickly or even get worse or against the contingency that
the staff is right and we are entering a recessionary period in which consumption and investment
fall short of what the fundamentals would suggest  i think that 25 basis points probably wont
buy us much if any insurance but it will get policy calibrated a little better to the situation that
we are facing today  i expect a small decrease in the funds rate to be consistent with further
increases in the unemployment rateand everybody does i think judging from the central
tendencies of the forecastwhich will put downward pressure and help to contain inflation  i
agree that there is an upside risk from continued increases in commodity prices that feed through
as president plosser noted into core inflation
i think that this is a very different situation from the 1970s  i looked this morning at the
economic report of the president at those tables in the back  the stage for the 1970s was set in
the 1960s  core inflation rose from 1 percent in the mid1960s to 6 percent in 1969  thats
a situation obviously in which inflation expectations can become unanchored and then these
relative price shocks feed through much more into inflation expectations  looking in the
greenbook part 2 page ii32 every measure of core inflation for 2007 was lower than the
measure of core inflation for 2006 and half of themthese are q4toq4 measures of core
inflationare lower than for 2005  so we are not in a situation of a gradual upcreep in core
inflation which i think was what set the stage for the 1970s
i dont expect a small decrease in interest rates to result in higher inflation through this
dollarcommodity priceinflation expectations channel either  the decrease in interest rates is
already in the markets  if anything a statement like alternative b might firm rates a bit and
taking out downside risks and act in a timely manner reinforces the notion that the federal
reserve is not poised to ease any more  i wouldnt expect interest rates to go down therefore i
wouldnt expect the dollar to go down and i wouldnt expect commodity prices to go up from
this
i think the markets reacted very well over the intermeeting period to incoming data
they saw the tail risk decrease  they raised interest rates  the dollar firmed  they put a u
shape in our interest rate path  it seems to me that path is very close to what many of us said we
expected and thought was appropriate give or take  point for the federal funds rate over the
coming couple of years  i dont see any reason to act in a way that changes those expectations i
think the market expectations are fine  i wouldnt lower interest rates  point just to confirm
market expectations  i think it is the right thing to do and i dont see any reason to lean against
it to change expectations  i think that expectations are lined up pretty well with our objectives
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  well mr chairman i was listening very carefully to governor kohn as
i do the rest of my colleagues  i noted your comment that it doesnt buy us much  im worried
that it may cost us much  had i gone first i would have made arguments similar to those of
president plosser and president evans  i am in favor of a pause  i think that is pretty clear  i
want to stress a couple of things i mentioned yesterday because i think theyre important  i am
concerned about our costs regarding what i call a different kind of adverse feedback loop which
is the inflation dynamic whereby reductions in the fed funds rate lead to a weaker dollar and
upward pressure on global commodity prices which feed through to higher us inflation and to
cutbacks in consumption by consumers and actions by employers to offset the effects of
inflation  i quoted a ceo whom i consider to be very highly regarded regarding his companys
behavioral patterns  this is someone by the way who was in the business in the 1970s  he
said were learning to run a business once again in an inflationary environment  that quote
bothers me because it shows a behavioral response  this goes beyond the issue but i thought
that comment you made yesterday about relative prices mr chairman was very interesting  but
it shows a behavioral response and behaviors eventually become habits and habits become
trends and im worried about that
there was a period when i felt that we were at risk of a repetition of the 1930s  i think
the liquidity measures that we have takenwhich i have fully supported and i applaud you mr
chairman and the new york group for thinking these through with the staffhave provided the
bridge that we spoke of yesterday  don you mentioned the 1970s  i am no longer worried about
the 1930s although i think there are tripwires out there that are very very serious  you pointed
to them in your intervention  you are right under bill martin these pressures were put in place
but somebody mentioned yesterdayit may have been vice chairman geithnerthat he wasnt
around in the 1970s  i actually sat by president carters side when he got lectures from a left
wing socialist named helmut schmidt and by a right winger named margaret thatcher  their
points were that you cannot risk appearing to be complacent about inflation  i worry that we risk
appearing to be complacent about inflation  i am speaking within the family here but i sense
that we are giving that appearance on the outside  the question really is is it worth  point
what is the riskreturn tradeoff here  i dont think its worth cutting  point  i think it is worth
staying where we are
i know that the markets anticipate x or y  we had a conversation about that yesterday  i
made my living in the markets  the markets come and go and i am happy to hear governor
kohn say that we are not influenced by the markets  i dont think we should be  their reactions
are momentary  but i just dont feel the riskreturn tradeoff makes it worthwhile for a  point
cut here unless we saw evidence of substantial downside slippage beyond what we are all
discounting for housing which is very negative  i have spoken about a price correction of
35 percent from peak to trough and were not there yet  it would have to be more negative than
that to convince me to cut rates further  so mr chairman i respectfully submit that we should
pause and thats how i plan to vote  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b with the wording that
has been proposed  but i do appreciate that there is a case for alternative c as well and i
understand and appreciate the arguments that have been made in favor of it  on the pure
economic merits i definitely support a 25 basis point cut  as i noted in my comments on the
economic situation it appears that the economy has stalled and may have fallen into a recession
i share the same concerns as governor kohn and president stern  my forecast is close to the
greenbook  i think a further easing in financial conditions is needed to counter the credit crunch
and i believe that a cut in the federal funds rate will be efficacious in easing financial conditions
although the real federal funds rate is accommodative by any usual measure of it i
completely agree with governor kohns discussion of this topic  this is a situation in which
spreads have increased so much and credit availability has diminished so much that looking at
the real federal funds rate is just a very misleading way of assessing the overall tightness of
financial conditions  i consider them on balance to be notably tighter than they were in the
beginning of august  i dont agree that further cuts in the federal funds rate will be ineffective in
helping us achieve our employment goal or counterproductive to the attainment of price stability
over the medium term  given that a 25 basis point cut is what the markets are now
anticipatingit is built ini would not expect this action coupled with the language in
alternative b to touch off further declines in the dollar or to exacerbate inflationary expectations
that said i did see arguments in favor of alternative c as well  i can see some advantage
in doing a little less today than markets are expecting as long as we reaffirm that we do retain the
flexibility to respond quickly to further negative news with additional cuts  a case that could be
made for pausing is that we will soon get information relating to gdp in the second quarter and
get a better read on just how serious the downturn is  with respect to market and inflationary
psychology i also can see a case for doing less than markets expect  it is true that some
measures of inflation expectations have edged up a bit and i would agree with president fisher
that perhaps a pause would counter any impression that we have become more tolerant of
inflation in the long run  but i dont think we have become more tolerant of inflation in the long
run and i did see todays reading on the employment cost index as further confirmation that at
this point nothing is built into labor markets that suggests that we are developing a wageprice
spiral of the type that was of such concern and really propelling the problems in the 1970s  on
the other hand i agree with president plosser too  wages arent a leading indicator  we have to
watch inflationary expectations  so i dont think that is definitive  nevertheless i do find it
quite reassuring that nothing is going on there at this point
i think doing nothing today might mitigate the risk of a flight from dollar assets which
could exacerbate financial turmoil  so there are arguments in favor of alternative c and i
recognize them  but on balance i believe that the stronger case is for b
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the fomc is badly in need of a stopping
rule on the federal funds rate  continued reaction to bad economic newsand there is likely to be
bad news in the coming monthsis going to set up serious future problems for this committee
the fragile credibility of the committee is being eroded as we speak and we will do well to take
steps to reassert inflationfighting resolve at this meeting
the intuition in dealing with the current crisis is that we can use new lending facilities to
help return financial markets to more normal operation and that interest rate policy is not that likely
to help on this dimension  but exceptionally low rates can create new problems  since lower rates
are not really helping directly with the smooth operation of financial markets i suggest that we put
that on hold for the time being and let our past stunningly aggressive interest rate moves have an
effect through the summer and into the second half of the year  this would be consistent with
alternative c in the policy alternatives
many participants have emphasized that there will be a long unwinding process  the
chairman described us as being in the third inning on this similar to the late 1980s and early 1990s
during that episode the fed went on hold at 3 percent considered an exceptionally low rate at the
time  that gave financial markets a chance to heal following the sl problems without creating
other problems for the mid to late 1990s  in retrospect this policy worked quite well during that
era and it seems to me that something similar could be done today at the current level of the federal
funds rate  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman im glad that reasonable people can differ  i do continue to
hold the view that easing policy today is a mistake  if i were voting on it i would vote to hold
where we are  with the fed funds rate at the level it currently is i think that continuing to ease
policy in an environment of rising inflationary pressures gives serious erosion to our longrun
credibility  we are seeing increasing signs that inflation expectations are rising  i see it constantly
as the publics inflation psychology is changing as well  this change reflects the large sustained
now increases in food energy and other commodities and accelerating import prices  i am
concerned that maintaining at this highly accommodative policy level for an extended period while
it may bring some shortrun stimulus into the economy increases inflationary risk to an
unacceptable level which will over the nottoodistant future begin to distort longrun investment
decisions and continue to increase the risk of financial instability and imbalances in the longerrun
finally on the psychology of the markets holding rates constant although it might disappoint some
on wall street will please many many on main street  i judge that it will confirm to the world that
we are turning our attention to these longerrun issues and im disappointed that were not seizing
the opportunity to make that statement  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  my concerns about the real economy are
similar to those that i had in march  i continue to believe that residential real estate markets could
deteriorate even further than what i have in my baseline projection and could exert even greater
downward pressure on business activity  financial markets in my view are still fragile and larger or
morewidespread liquidity pressures could quickly present us with an even weaker set of economic
fundamentals  at the same time i cant easily dismiss the ongoing escalation of energy and
commodity prices  although many of us as we talked about yesterday have expected these price
pressures to abate for some time they have not and as i indicated yesterday i do believe there is a
risk that core inflation will not follow the downward path that i submitted as my projection for this
meeting  so like others i can see a case being made for alternative c  however i think a modest
reduction to our policy rate today as a precaution against further slippage in the real economy is
prudent  but i also strongly support the language that indicates were very close to if not at a
pausing point in our easing cycle  so i support the policy recommendation and the language in
alternative b  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  i find myself agreeing with my colleagues who
have advocated alternative c  one way to think about our approach to the policy decision today is
to look ahead and think about the probabilities associated with two bad outcomes  will the
economy go into a substantially deeper recession than we expect  or coming out of this recession
will the trailing inflation rate be higher than it was when we went in  although i hope neither of
these occurs my sense right now is that the chance of an increase in trend inflation is more likely
than a much deeper recession and i think we should alter our policy path accordingly
the incoming data since the beginning of the year have resulted in a more adverse outlook
and that change in the outlook is already in my view reflected in the current stance of policy  i
noted yesterday that the real federal funds rate using the greenbooks inflation forecast rather than
fourquarter lagged core inflation is now between minus  and minus  percent  i think it makes
sense to take advantage of information about foreseeable gaps between overall inflation and core
and the stance of policy strikes me as very stimulative certainly plenty for the recession we now
expect when we look at back historical recessions  as i noted yesterday at the retail level for firms
and consumers spreads arent out of line with where theyve been in past recessions  it is true that
jumbo mortgage rates and some other rates have not come down as much as theyve come down in
past recessions but i just remind people of the secular technology shift  theres a sort of level shift
in intermediation technology that were going through right now that really constitutes a change in
the relative prices of different financial assets
now i cant think clearly about the stance of policy without talking first about the riskfree
rate and then thinking about various spreads as really having to do with the relative prices of
different financial claims  so in looking at and through retail rates thats informative  but the risk
free rate is the riskfree rate and an array of factors affects how those relative financial prices
evolve  the securitization channel that seemed to work very well for a while is now exposed as
more costly and less efficacious than once was thought  some of these securitization vehicles didnt
exist in past recessions or expansions and only a couple of decades ago these spreads were as high
as or higher than they are now  so i stick to thinking about the stance of monetary policy in terms
of the real riskfree rate
i think our experience between the january and the march meetings with inflation
expectations is pretty good evidence of their fragility in the current environment without our having
articulated what our longrun objective is for inflation  i dont think that the level of inflation
expectations is aligned with our objectives i think it is too high relative to our objectives  market
participants see a good chance of our dropping the rate  point today and reversing field later in this
year and raising rates again  i suspect they dont fully grasp how difficult its going to be to reverse
course while we negotiate the murky waters of the recovering economy later this year  indeed i
think that the fiscal stimulus that were going to get will make those waters even murkier  it will be
even harder to divine the underlying exfiscalpolicy strength of the economy
so for these reasons i believe that we should leave the fed funds rate alone today  the
upward surprise at our last meeting did not appear to affect financial markets adversely  coupled
with that statements emphasis on inflation risks it did seem to have the beneficial effect of
reversing the runup in inflation expectations  i would expect that leaving the funds rate alone today
would have a similar beneficial effect in stabilizing inflation expectations  so i favor alternative c
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i can support alternative b but i must admit i
cant do it with the conviction that i would prefer to have  i think market participants will look at
our decision today and at the data over the next few weeks and try to measure whether we can hold
up to the pause language that accompanies alternative b  taking action with a 25 basis point move
today we have to then be prepared to stomach the continued weakness in the real economy that is in
many of our projections  speaking for myself id say we also have to be prepared when we next
meet to hold the line even if we see a retracing of some of the improvements in financial markets
so in my own base case the judgment when we next meet will be a harder one  the economy
might look weak financial markets might look weaker than they are and trying to signal to the
markets in alternative b that we are serious about holding the line at what would then be 2 percent is
putting a pretty hard task on us  i think were capable of holding the line there but we have to hold
ourselves to that standard
the 25 basis point move in and of itself doesnt strike me as that consequential  what
strikes me as consequential is the symbolism  given the uncertainties that dave and the team have
spoken about it strikes me that the 25 basis points is not nearly as consequential in effect as what
might well happen to the transmission mechanism and the efficacy of this change in federal funds
rates on the real economy  put differently if the financial markets can get back to business they
will be helping the real economy in effect lowering the cost of capital far more than our actions
would today
as i said i think the symbolism here does matter  by moving 25 basis points today were
taking some risks with the dollar  i think that the dollar improvement we have seen over the past
several days and weeks has occurred because theres an expectation that we are closer to a pause
and that this committee is going to have a tougher decision about whether or not to move than they
had anticipated some weeks ago  even though the language in alternative b is useful in trying to lay
the factual predicate for a pause when we next meet there will be a lot of folks who will be
wondering about our convictions there and when they do i think we are assuming some dollar
risks  we are also assuming incremental risks on the inflation front  continued easing could well
encourage the perception that the fomc has a greater tolerance for inflation than is prudent with
potential adverse effects on inflation expectations a further runup in commodity prices and a
continued decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar
so this is a tough judgment that were making with significant uncertainty  i take comfort
in believing that the language in the minutes and the remarks that we all offer between now and the
next time we meet will suggest not that this is a cut with a dovish pause but that this is a cut with an
expectation of holding after our actions today  we are not barring all events because we can
certainly imagine the world turning yet again and we can certainly imagine another letdown
particularly in the global economy  but this is a statement that we want to hold after our action
today and that we are prepared to stomach some additional bad news with respect both to the
economy and to financial markets  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you mr chairman  as many speakers before me have said this
is a pretty close call and reasonable cases can be made for both alternative b and alternative c  if
you look at financial market conditions you can see your favorite indicator and say whether things
have eased or not eased  one indicator that i look at when thinking about the transmission of
monetary policy is the liborois spread which has gone up very significantly  a lot of short
term borrowing is priced off of that  if we wanted just to keep policy where it was six weeks ago
we would actually have to cut morenot that im suggesting that we should  but if you use that
spread as the relevant indicator it would suggest that if one were to keep the same stance or
potentially the same stance of monetary policy youd have to cut a lot  it doesnt seem as though
our liquidity facilities have been effective on this particular dimension  we had been hopeful that
they would be but they dont seem to be  even with some of the things that we voted on yesterday
were still going to see very elevated spreads in some of these markets still making borrowing costs
relatively high and so disrupting the traditional monetary transmission mechanism  so thats where
i would argue for alternative b
another argument for alternative b is the potentially protracted slowdown  i agree very
much with president stern  as ive talked about a lot before this sort of slow burn is related to the
housing market  the repair and recovery of those markets is going to take a long time  the spreads
are still quite elevated in a number of these markets  so providing more cushion against the
downside risk there for those markets and then thinking about how that risk affects the potential for
broader downside risks in which the housing market seems to be a potential trigger point for
negative nonlinear dynamics again suggests that moving down 25 basis points now is prudent
the key of course that people have been talking about is inflation pressures going
forwardinflation expectations  here a case can be made on either side with some cogency  one
challenge we have right now is that we have a lot of differences in the way to read inflation
expectations  looking at the fiveyearahead versus the fivetotenyearahead weve seen them
spread apart quite a bit and now start to come back together with the next five years starting to
move up but the fivetotenyearahead moving down  we have a number of other measures of
expectations some of which have moved up quite significantly but maybe primarily because of
some relative price movements rather than underlying inflation trends
one thing that is comforting for me on the alternative b side is that during the last year to 18
months when we have had very lowbelow 5 percentunemployment rates we have seen very
little evidence of high wage pressure  i find it unlikely that it is going to increase as the
unemployment rate goes above 5 percent and i think as many people around the table do that
unemployment may sustain itself above 5 percent for quite some time  we also havent seen some
of the real shocks to energy and commodity prices feed through to core  now that still could be
coming  but weve seen very elevated prices in these areas for quite some timesix to nine
monthsand the most recent readings from the pce index suggest that they havent fed through
maybe that is still to come and i think to be worried about that is reasonable  it is also reasonable
to be worried about implications for the dollar if we were to go for alternative b rather than
alternative c
but the language in alternative b can provide some comfort to the markets that we are
unlikely to be pushing much further given what we see and what we expect but that we are open to
that possibility  we certainly have a very long time between this meeting and the next meeting
were going to be getting two employment reports gdp and a lot of other information so we may
need to revisit some of these issues  but at this point i would come down for alternative b with the
language that we have  i think it gives us the appropriate flexibility and i dont see sufficient
evidence of an unhinging of inflation expectations or actual inflationary pressures at least with
respect to core to say that we need to take a pause now  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  well im in a very uncomfortable position
here because i usually like to be very decisive and i think in all past cases ive had a strong view
before going into the meeting in terms of what is the appropriate alternative that the committee
should take at least that i should take  im in a very uncomfortable position because im actually
sitting exactly on the fence between alternative b and alternative c  as you know sitting on the
fence and having a fence right in that anatomically uncomfortable position is not a good place to be
laughter  so let me go through the current situation and argue why im in this uncomfortable
position
the first point to make is that inflation expectations are actually reasonably well contained
it is true that i have a concern that high headline inflation could make containing inflation
expectations and preserving the nominal anchor more difficult  but it is important to note that we
have been in a situation in which weve had very high headline inflation and in fact core inflation
and inflation expectations have behaved very well  so its very important to emphasize that this is
not the 1970s and i really get disturbed when people point to that as a problem  we do have to
worry about inflation expectations possibly going up but its not a situation that if we make a
mistake they go up a whole lot  they could go up and it might be costly to get them down but it
would not be a disaster
the second issue is that although we may have turned the corner we are still in a situation
of very fragile financial markets and we have been disappointed before  i am getting more
optimistic  im hopeful and think its very possible that well look back at the middle of march and
say that was the worst of it  but there is a possibility and its not a small possibility that things
could go south again and that would argue for the need for aggressive cuts in the future
the third thing that i point out about the situation is that the modal forecast given by the
greenbookand consistent with my modal forecast and with the modal forecasts of most of the
participantssuggests that we may have to cut a bit further in the future  so the problem is that
given the conditions that we face we need a lot of flexibility to deal with potential downside risks  i
think the downside risks have diminished but they could go back up again  so there could be a
situation in which we need to ease aggressively in the future  of course weve convinced the
markets that we are nongradualists but so far weve been nongradualists in only one direction
which is to ease  in fact wed like to be in a situation where we could aggressively ease in the
future if we had to but not risk having inflation expectations go up  thats a very serious problem
that many participants have pointed out
so how would i like the markets to perceive us  well id like the markets to perceive us as
being willing to be very aggressive in terms of easing if necessary but id also like them to
perceive us as having the volcker characteristics of being six feet six inches tall and having a big
baseball bat and if inflation and inflation expectations are starting to unhinge being willing to take
out the baseball bat and do whatever is necessary  you really would like to position yourself to
have those characteristics
so let me first talk about the case for alternative c of not changing and then go to the case
for alternative b  in the case for c the advantage of pausing at this point is that it would actually
indicate to the markets by our actions that were serious about keeping inflation under control and
that its more likely that we would bring out the baseball bat  in that sense it could enhance
credibility and a very important positive element of that is that it would be easier for us to be
flexibly aggressive if we needed to be so in the future  that is one reason that i think there is a
strong case for alternative c  but i also think there is a strong case for b  first the evidence that
inflation expectations are unhinged or are likely to get unhinged is not very strong  i do not put a lot
of stock in consumer surveys  but i tend to look at financial markets as being the canary in the coal
mine  though being a new yorker i actually have been in a coal mine laughter  at the museum
of science and industry in chicago  its really cool  all of you should go there someday when you
go visit charlie
mr kroszner  but he has never seen a canary  laughter
mr mishkin  i have seen a canary  but the key is that the canary has not keeled over
in fact if you look at whats going on in the financial markets the concerns in terms of inflation
compensation have dissipated somewhat  i think the fact that they were moving up is an indication
of greater inflation risk  theyve come back down again  i dont think that should make us
complacent but i do think it tells us that we havent seen anything really bad happen at this stage
so the question is why we should cut now and go with alternative b rather than c  well
first i think the modal forecast suggested that a cut is in line with optimal monetary policy and i
think thats an important argument  it is particularly so because there is a very strong likelihood
that even though im a little more confident that the recession that were probably in now will be
very mild if its even a recession at alli think it is likely that were in a recession but a mild
onethe recovery actually is going to have a lot of the characteristics of the recovery that we had in
the 1990s because its just going to take a long time to clean up this mess  that again argues for a
cut  the other issue that i think is important is that there is a very long period between now and the
next fomc meeting  given that the modal forecasts indicate that things are likely to get worse in
the economy in this quarter there is an issue that if we get bad news then we might regret not
having cut now and im not a big fan of intermeeting cuts  that would be another argument for
cutting now
i guess the bottom line is that im just in a very uncomfortable position in that i dislike
being not very decisive here  one thing that has helped me a lot in being comfortable with
alternative b is that the language has changed quite significantly from the initial wording  i was not
happy with the idea that if we suggest that there will be a pause in the future it would be time
dependent  it should be clearly datadependent  if it were timedependent we would get into
exactly the problem that charlie evans talked about  we want the flexibility of saying that what
were doing is dependent on data not time because if people know that youre going to reverse
things later on it doesnt have the impact  i think that is an important change here  so im quite
comfortable with the language of alternative b  im willing to support b  it looks as though that is
the consensus and my view today is that im going to go with whatever the consensus is  thank
you very much
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  the transcript says
mishkin says canary wheezing but hasnt keeled over  laughter  i support alternative b  i think
you could frame this as a modest recalibration of policy with a hawkish soft pause
chairman bernanke  and a wheezing canary  laughter
vice chairman geithner  i dont think the canary is wheezing  look i think there
are lots of good arguments on both sides of this  i think all the good ones have been made  the
markets have been giving us a pretty good test against the concern which i think we all share that if
we move today we risk some significant erosion of our inflation credibility or inflation expectations
feeding through the dollar into a commodity price spiral  we have had a pretty good test of it  over
the past several weeks there has been a very substantial shift in expectations for the path of the fed
funds rate which embody substantial expectations around a nearterm cut and very little beyond that
and some modest retracing as we go forward  expectations have come down despite what has
happened to oil prices  inflation has come down  the dollar is stronger on net over that period
this is pretty good validation that the path that is represented in alternative b does not come with
excessive risk that we will be eroding our credibility  we cant know for sure  its good to be
worried about that risk but the protection against that risk is fairly good
what strikes me about this discussion is the extent of the gap in this committee in how we
think about the way to measure the stance of monetary policy  what we could do is use a seminar
and a bit of history on this  it would be nice to run monetary policy back over the past four decades
to see if it had been set with a basic policy regime in which we looked only at the real fed funds rate
deflated by headline inflation today what the outcomes would have been for the economy at that
time  thats essentially what you guys are saying  it seems to me that you are basically saying that
equilibrium doesnt vary and that deflating the nominal fed funds rate with some mix of headline
and core today is the best way to judge the stance of policy  but i think its worth having a little
exercise in it  it is hard to look back
mr plosser  excuse me  make sure that you say youre speaking for yourself not for
me in terms of how i think about policy
vice chairman geithner  okay but it is a surprising gap  so i think it would be
worth some time to think through that  obviously we also disagree about how inflation works in the
united states how relative price shocks take effect and what we should respond to in that sense
that would be worth a little time too  again it is a surprise to me  we sit here to make monetary
policy and we havent talked much about this basic core question  how should we judge the stance
of policy  it would be worth some attention
i just want to end by saying something about the dollar  my basic sense about the dollar
and im very worried about this dynamic nowis that it has been trading more on concern about
tail risk in the economy and in the financial system than anything else  as i said yesterday if you
look back to when there has been an increase in perceived tail risk however you want to measure
itcredit default swaps on financials or something like thatand the twoyear has fallen sharply or
we have had a big flight to quality those have been the periods that have been most adverse to the
dollar  now it is not a consistent pattern but i think its basically right and i think it gives an
important illustration that what goes into a judgment about whether people hold dollars and us
financial assets has to do with a lot of things  it has a lot to do with confidence that this committee
will reduce the tail risk in the financial system and the economy to tolerable levels  it also has a lot
to do with confidence in our willingness to keep inflation stable over a long period but its not only
that  again we have had a pretty good experiment in that proposition over the past year or so
my sense is that the biggest risk to the dollar since im pretty confident that this committee
is going to make good judgments about inflation going forward is in the monetary policy of other
countries  the real problem for us now is that we have a large part of the world economyin non
china nonjapan asia and the major energy exportersstill running a monetary policy that is
based on the dollar as nominal anchor  that has left them with remarkably easy monetary policy
and a pretty significant rise in assetprice inflation  the transition ahead for them as they try to get
more independence for monetary policy and soften the link to the dollar is going to carry a lot of
risk for us because the market is going to infer from that a big shift in preferences for the currencies
that both governments and private actors in those countries hold  as that evolution takes place in
their exchange rate and monetary policy regimes the risk for us is that the market expects a
destabilizing shift in portfolio preferences which people might infer is also a loss of confidence in
us financial assets  i think thats a big problem for us  its not clear to me that it means that we
should run a tighter monetary policy against that risk than would otherwise be appropriate because i
dont think it buys much protection against that risk  i just want to associate myself with all the
concerns said about the dollar in this context  the judgment that goes into confidence and peoples
willingness to hold us financial assets is deeply textured and complex and it has a lot to do with
confidence in this committees capacity to navigate the perilous path between getting and keeping
down that tail risk and preserving the confidence that inflation expectations over time will stay
stable  so i support alternative b and its language
chairman bernanke  thank you all  the discussion was very good as usual and let
me just assure you that i listened very very carefully  so im certainly hearing what youre saying
and i understand the concerns that people have expressed  i play jekyll and hyde quite a bit and
argue with myself in the shower and other places  laughter  let me first say that i think we ought
to at least modestly congratulate ourselves that we have made some progress  our policy actions
including both rate cuts and the liquidity measures have seemed to have had some benefit  i think
the fear has moderated  the markets have improved somewhat  as i said yesterday i am cautious
about this  theres a good chance that we will see further problems and further relapses but we
have made progress in reducing some of the uncertainties in the current environment
i also think that theres a lot of agreement around the tableand i certainly agreethat we
have reached the point where further aggressive ratecutting is not going to be productive and that
we should now be signaling a willingness to sit watch and listen for a time for two reasons  first
risks are now more balanced  that is there is more attention to inflation risks and dollar risks and
although our output risks remain quite significant the balance is closer than it has been for some
time  second given that we have done a lot in a short time and moved aggressively and that were
seeing fiscal actions coming in and perhaps other policy effects as welllagged effects of our own
actions it seems to be a reasonable time for us to pause to watch carefully and to presume that
were not going to move unless conditions strongly warrant it  so i think that at least in that broad
respect theres a lot of agreement around the table
the two alternatives that have been discussed by most people are b which is to move
25 basis points today but to send a fairly strong signal of a preference to pause after this meeting
and c which is not to move but to keep some elements of the downside risk alive in our risk
assessment  like a number of people i think both are plausible  both have appeal  alternative c
in particular has the appeal of pushing back against some critics on the inflation side who have
criticized us for not being sufficiently attentive to the dollar to commodity prices and so on  as i
said yesterday i think that inflation is an important problem  its a tremendous complication given
what is happening now in the other parts of the economy  in no way do i disagree with the points
made by many participants that inflation is a critical issue for us and that we have to pay very close
attention to it  as i said yesterday i do think that some of the criticism that we are getting is just
simply misinformed  i dont think theres any plausible interest rate policy that we can follow that
would eliminate the bulk of the changes in commodity prices that were seeing  i think they are due
mostly to global supplyanddemand conditions  a small piece of evidence for that is that yesterday
the ecb was mentioned favorably as having the appropriate inflation attitudes compared with our
attitudes  i would just note that headline inflation in the euro zone is about the same as it is here
despite their stronger currency because they are being driven by the same global commodity prices
that we are
i would also say that although the inflation situation is a very important concern i dont see
any particular deterioration in the near term  since the last meeting oil prices have gone up which
is very high profile but gold for example has dropped about 12 or 13 percent  other precious
metals are down  some other commodities are down  the dollar is stronger  tips breakevens
have moved in the right direction  wages as we saw this morning are stable and i would urge you
to compare wage behavior over the past five years with wage behavior during the 1970s  wage
growth then was not only high but also very unstable and responsive to shortterm movements in
headline inflation  so i think the canary is still getting decent breath here  laughter  i want us to
be careful not to overpromise  we cannot do anything about the relative price of gasoline and i
dont think that were on the edge of an abyss of the 1970s type  i do think its an important issue
and i do think that there is benefit to pushing against the perceptions  in this business perceptions
have an element of reality to them and we understand that  thats an important part of central
banking and i fully appreciate that point  so again i see a lot of merit in the alternative c
approach
as i think you can conjecture im going to recommend alternative b25 basis points but
with a stronger indication of a pause  let me discuss why in the end i come down on that side
first is the substance the fundamentals  i dont think that 25 basis points is irrelevant  for
example onemonth libor is up about 35 basis points since our last meeting  these shortrun
financing costs do matter particularly in a situation of financial fragility  so it is not just an issue
as president evans mentioned of longterm interest rate expectations  overnight and shortterm
financing costs do matter for the financial markets and a lower rate will help the markets to heal   it
will affect other rates  to take an obvious example it affects the adjustable rate that mortgages
move to in the economy  so i think theres a case to be made on the substance  i will not add much
to the discussion about how we define accommodative  but one way to do it i guess is to look at
the greenbooks very thorough analysis which rather than using rules of thumb attempts to look at
a broad forecast conditional on what the staff can ascertain about the financial drags that were
seeing  their analysis suggests that something around where we are or a little lower is consistent
with slow economic growth but also price stability within a relatively short time  that is one way of
trying to calibrate  obviously there are other ways as well
the second point id make besides just the substance is the consistency with our own
projections  virtually everybody around the table still thinks that the downside risks to growth are
significant and weve mentioned the same factorsfinancial conditions housing and a few other
things  those remain very serious downside risks  i dont think anybody thinks they are under
control at this point  yes we also see an increased number of people with upside risks to inflation
but again in terms of the numbers well publish i think the downside risks are still held by more
people than the inflation assessment  that by the way suggests why we cant really do what
president plosser suggestshold and move to the alternative b paragraph 4 language  not to
move and to say that the risks are balanced would i think be clearly inconsistent with the risk
assessments that are in the projections
the other issues have to do with communications  we are at an important transition point in
our communication strategy  one of the risks that we took when we made the very rapid cuts in
interest rates earlier this year was the problem of coming to this exact point when we would have to
communicate to the markets that we were done that we were going to flatten out and that we were
going to a mode of waiting  it was always difficult to figure out how that was going to work in a
smooth way  whether through luck or design market expectations have set up perfectly  i mean
basically theyre now assuming a flat path going forward with some increase later and that appears
to be consistent as vice chairman geithner noted in the last few days with significant dollar
appreciation declines in commodity prices and declines in inflation expectationsall the things
that we want to see  it appears that were in a position that had seemed really problematic some
time ago so we are now able to make the transition in a way that will be relatively clear and i hope
not too disruptive
now i want to come back to the issue of disappointing markets  i agree with president
fisher and many others that disappointing markets can be a good thing  it is certainly not always a
bad thing by any means  i think the issue is a little more subtle than that  the issue here is the
clarity of what were trying to say and the way our message is going to be read  let me make two
points about that  if we were to do alternative c i think there would be essentially two issues  one
is that although we would not be moving which would be a surprise we would also not be
declaring a pause because of downside risk which would be another surprise  wed have a surprise
both in the action and in the statement  the risk there is that we confuse the markets about what our
intentions are and what would cause us to respond  for example the greenbooks projections of
fridays employment numbers are somewhat more pessimistic than those being held in the market
if we took action c today and fridays numbers were consistent with the greenbook forecast and
with our own projections but worse significantly worse than the market expectation would
statement c then lead to the building in of additional ease  i think there would be a lot of confusion
therea lot of uncertainty about what exactly we are saying about when wed be willing to
respond
the other communication issue that i have with alternative cand this again is something
president fisher said yesterdayis that if we dont move and we put c out there the stock market
could go up because it might be read as saying that the fed has increased confidence is seeing
things looking better and is feeling stronger about the economy  im not sure that really is the
assessment we have and if we then have bad data on the labor markets and the financial markets
weaken somewhat will we be seen as having made a wrong call as being blindsided by
circumstances  this is more discussion than its worth but what im trying to convey is that its
not just a question of disappointing or not disappointing markets  its a question of whether or not
were sending a clear message  i think alternative b while its consistent with our risk assessments
is also a pretty strong statement  let me just for what it is worth assure you now that data that
come in within the general broad ranges of what were expecting even though they will be weak
should not cause us to ease further given this statement  i believe that this statement will provide us
with plenty of cover  no matter what the markets expect we have said that we have come to a point
at which we need to take a pause we need to see whats happening and we are going to be watchful
and waiting
with respect to the language i just want to point out how much the language in
alternative b has moved from march  it really is a very significant change  first of all we are
acknowledging explicitly how much we have already donethe substantial easing of monetary
policy to date plus the measures to foster market liquidityand expressing a general confidence
implicit in that first sentence that we have done a lot that it is likely to help and therefore that we
should wait and see what happens  second we removed any reference to downside risk to growth
which has been in there for a long time  thats a very strong statement  that says a lot about our
inclinations going further  third weve added the phrase continue to monitor which to me
suggests very much a watchful waiting rather than an active approach to developments in the
economy  finally we have made it clear that we are going to be data dependent and in particular
though we have done a lot we are expecting continued weakness and well act as needed  but we
have taken out the timely manner so the presumption that well be responding in a very rapid and
aggressive way i think has been moderated
i think of alternative b as being a compromise in the sense that it takes a step that is
consistent with the fundamentals in terms of the underlying tightness of the financial system and the
risks that most of us see to economic growth as well as inflation  at the same time i think it is a
rather strong step in expressing a shift in our strategythat we are moving from the phase of rapid
declines and aggressiveness to a phase of waiting and observing how this economy is going to
evolve  again with full respect to everyones comments i understand  unlike governor mishkin
i wasnt sitting on the fence i thought that was a little uncomfortable  but i understand the
concerns and the arguments  the communication issues did concern me and largely on that basis i
would advocate b today  are there any comments  if not could you please take a roll call
ms danker  this vote encompasses the language of alternative b in the table that was
handed out as part of bills briefing yesterday as well as the directive from the bluebook
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will
foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives
the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing
the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent

chairman bernanke  thank you  i will ask the governors to join me in the office
for the discount rate decision  everyone else why dont you take a 20minute coffee break
coffee break
chairman bernanke  okay  why dont we recommence  the meeting that we are
about to begin is a joint meeting of the fomc and the board so i need a motion to close the
meeting
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  the discussion is about interest on
reserves  let me turn to brian
mr madigan5  thank you mr chairman  we will be referring to the package of material labeled implications of interest on reserves for monetary policy implementation  today the staff will report on work prompted by two changes the congress made to the federal reserve act in october 2006 and will seek your guidance on further work  both changes become effective in october 2011  as shown on page 2 the first change allows the board to authorize the reserve banks to pay interest on balances maintained by depository institutions at an interest rate or rates not to exceed the general level of shortterm interest rates the second allows the board to set required reserve ratios on transaction deposits within a range of 0 to 14 percent rather than the currently mandated range of 8 to 14 percent permitting the fed effectively to eliminate reserve requirements if it chooses these two changes will allow the federal reserve to make significant improvements in its approach to monetary policy implementation  they give us an opportunity to reduce distortions and deadweight losses resulting from our current complex system of reserve requirements  they also give us an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation in routine circumstances as well as in conditions of financial stress

5  the materials used by messrs madigan meyer clouse hilton and dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 5
while the congress made important changes in the law it also left some key statutory constraints in place  as discussed on page 3 if the board chooses to retain reserve requirements the law continues to allow them to be imposed only on transaction deposits nonpersonal time deposits and eurodollar liabilities and only on depository institutions  in effect the law continues to enshrine a system of reserve requirements that was designed to facilitate control of m1an objective that has had little relevance to the conduct of us monetary policy for a quartercentury  second the prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits remains in force and is a significant continuing distortion in the us financial system  we continue to work with congressional committees and staff to seek opportunities for the repeal of this prohibition  third the law retains significant constraints on the assets that the federal reserve can purchase in the open market  fourth interest on reserves has potential implications for priced services and for reserve bank operations more generally  finally the federal reserve remains unable to pay explicit interest on balances held at the federal reserve by the treasury and by foreign central banks
page 4 summarizes the steps we have taken to date in our work on interest on reserves  shortly after the legislation was passed the chairman asked the staff to begin background work  last year a system workgroup undertook a preliminary study of a range of options for implementing monetary policy given the new authorities  id like to recognize the participants in that workgroup who made remarkable progress during a period in which some of these individuals were experiencing considerable pressures relating to the implementation of monetary policy that day not just in five years  these individuals included jim clouse seth carpenter john driscoll sherry edwards david mills and travis nesmith from the board spence hilton leo bartolini chris burke todd keister antoine martin and jamie mcandrews from the new york fed ron feldman from minneapolis steve meyer from the philadelphia fed and huberto ennis and john weinberg from richmond  separately a system workgroup coheaded by don hammond here at the board and ron mitchell at the boston fed has begun work on the implications for priced services of paying explicit interest on balances  in february the board hosted a workshop on monetary policy implementation five foreign central banks and the federal reserve participated
as shown on page 5 our briefing today is in four parts  after this introduction steve meyer will present a summary of the federal reserves current approach to implementing monetary policy  next jim clouse and spence hilton will discuss five options for implementing the new legislative authorities  finally bill dudley will make a number of concluding comments and present our recommendations
as shown on page 6 we will be seeking your comments on the criteria that we have tentatively adopted for evaluating the options on the options themselves and on the process and timeline that we are tentatively proposing for this project  one of the key issues is whether you would be prepared to see reserve requirements reduced to zero  steve will now continue our presentation
mr meyer  as brian noted i will summarize our current approach  as indicated on page 7 i will discuss depository institutions demand for central bank balances how the desk manages the supply of balances and outcomes in the federal funds market  there are three components of demand  some depository institutions dis hold balances to satisfy the reserve requirements shown on page 8  many more hold contractual clearing balances and some routinely hold excess reserves
page 9 notes that dis can meet their reserve requirements by holding currency by holding balances at a reserve bank and by holding deposits at a correspondent that holds an equal amount at a reserve bank  these assets earn no interest so dis have an incentive to reduce their required reserves to the level of vault cash and reserve balances they would choose to hold if there were no requirements  in practice dis cut required reserves by using sweep programs that shift deposits out of transaction accounts into linked nonreservable accounts  this stratagem works because the fed applies reserve requirements to endofday postsweep deposits  about half of the dis have no reserve requirement  a large majority of the remainder meet their requirements entirely with vault cash  only 1500 dis hold balances to meet reserve requirements so last year required reserve balances averaged less than 7 billion an amount equal to 01 percent of total deposits in the us banking system  economists claim that central banks impose reserve requirements to ensure a sizable demand for central bank balances  imposing a high required reserve ratio on a narrow deposit base and then allowing dis to run sweep programs and use vault cash to meet reserve requirements does not achieve that goal
more than 7000 dis have accounts at reserve banks  on an average day they use their accounts to make and receive more than 05 million interbank payments with a value of roughly 25 trillion  as noted on page 10 many of those dis need a  larger balance to avoid frequent overnight overdrafts than to satisfy reserve requirements  about 5700 choose to hold a contractual clearing balance  the incentive to maintain a contractual balance is that such balances earn implicit interest that offsets the fees a di incurs when it uses our priced services  but these earnings credits cannot be paid in cash so dis that do not use our services have no incentive to hold a contractual balance  page 11 shows that dis hold a bit less than 7 billion of contractual clearing balances  the rough equality with required reserve balances is coincidence
required and contractual balances though small facilitate the implementation of
us monetary policy in two ways as indicated on page 12  first required and contractual balances are set before the start of each reserve maintenance period so they establish a predictable lower bound on the periodaverage demand for balances second dis are allowed to meet reserve requirements and contractual balance commitments on average over multiday reserve maintenance periods  this averaging feature helps make the demand for balances interest elastic  dis reduce the opportunity cost of meeting requirements by holding smaller balances on days when the fed funds rate is above target and larger balances on days when the funds rate is
below target  carryover provisions and clearing bands which give dis some flexibility to hold too many or too few balances in one maintenance period and the opposite in the next period also help make the demand for balances interest elastic
page 13 summarizes the third component of demand for balances  desired excess reserves  large dis usually aim to hold zero excess reserves on average  small dis as a group generally hold positive excess reserves  the left half of the graph on page 14 illustrates that the daily sum of required contractual and excess reserve balances averaged about 15 billion from january through july of last year but varied between
10 billion and 25 billion  the daytoday variation largely reflects big banks behavior  big banks want much larger balances on days when an unusually large volume of payments flows through their federal reserve accounts than on other days this strategy lowers their risk of incurring overnight overdrafts on highpayment flow days while reducing their opportunity cost of holding noninterestbearing balances on other days  the right half of the graph shows that demand for balances has oscillated even more widely since august  even at 25 billion or more dis balances are not big enough to clear 25 trillion of fedwire payments per day without incurring overdrafts  indeed dis make heavy use of daylight credit  at least in theory ready availability of inexpensive daylight credit reduces dis demand for central bank balances  a proposed reduction in the cost of collateralized daylight creditthe proposal is now out for public commentmay further reduce demand for balances
we turn next to the supply of balances beginning on page 16  youve told the desk to keep the federal funds rate close to target on average  the desk does so by trying to make each days supply of balances equal to the quantity that dis would demand that day if the funds rate were at target  the desks strategy is to use outright purchases or sales of treasury securities plus 14day and 28day repurchase agreements to supply a level of balances somewhat lower than the minimum amount the banking system is likely to demand going forward  the desk then uses one to sevenday repo to supply the remainder  the desk structures its operations so that maturing repo almost always leave the supply of balances short of the quantity demanded and then undertakes a new repo to fill in the gap  but as indicated on page 17 the desk does not completely control the supply  unanticipated changes in autonomous factors can make the supply of balances larger or smaller than projected the staffs at the board and in new york do a very good job but not a perfect job of predicting changes in these factors
variations in borrowing from the primary dealer credit facility also affect the supply of balances  for example citigroup global markets borrowed on 20 of the first 25 business days that the pdcf was in operation in amounts that varied from
05 billion to 27 billion  barclays capital borrowed on 21 days in amounts that ranged from 1 billion to 7 billion  four other primary dealers were frequent borrowers another six borrowed less often  changes in pdcf credit are not always captured in the staffs daily projections so they can and do cause the supply of balances to deviate from the intended level  in any case if the days projected supply
is not close to the forecast of quantity demanded the desk conducts an open market operation to make the two roughly equal  as noted on page 18 the desk was in the market almost every business dayindeed all but six business daysfrom january 2006 through july 2007 replacing maturing repo with larger or smaller repo as projections showed a need to add or to drain balances
how well does this approach to implementing monetary policy work  if the key criterion is keeping the funds rate close to target our current approach works well in normal times and not so well when interbank markets are under stress  but our current approach imposes substantial and unnecessary burdens  as the graph on page 20 indicates the effective fed funds rate is almost always within a few basis points of target during normal times as it was from january through july of last year but there have been many largerthanusual deviations from target since last august for two primary reasons  first daily variations in demand for balances have become larger and more difficult to forecast  second demand apparently has become less responsive to temporary deviations of the funds rate from targetthat is demand has become less elastic  even so the average of daily deviations from target has been close to zero since midseptember  pages 21 and 22 summarize equilibrium in the federal funds market and the reasons for large deviations from target  fed funds typically trade near the target early in the morning because buyers and sellers usually expect the desk to supply enough balances to get the funds rate to target in the afternoon  but the funds rate sometimes is firm or soft in early trading signaling a likely shortage or surplus of balances and leading the desk to aim for a somewhat larger or smaller supply than otherwise
after the desk conducts the days operation three things happen concurrently the supply of balances responds to changes in autonomous factors and pdcf credit the demand for balances is realized as dis make and receive payments and dis trade federal funds determining the days average or effective funds rate  if the supply of balances is close to the actual quantity demanded and if the payment system and the federal funds market work normally the funds rate will be close to target  any excess demand or supply generally does not become apparent until late in the day when the desk is unable to adjust the supply of balances because primary dealers no longer have uncommitted collateral  dis that end up with larger balances than they want late in the afternoon seek to sell fed funds  when the banking system as a whole has sizable excess balances dis that try to sell fed funds late in the day find few buyers  because balances earn no interest the funds rate can fall to zero in that situation  on the other hand an excess demand for balances makes the funds rate rise relative to target  if the funds rate climbs sufficiently above the primary credit rate some dis overcome their reluctance to borrow raising the supply of balances and helping limit the increase in the funds rate
last august provides an interesting case study  the demand for balances rose as dis sought greater liquidity  the desk increased the supply  even so the funds rate traded firm relative to target almost every morning as european banks bid aggressively for fed funds to lock in dollar funding before the end of their business
day in europe  the firm morning rate suggested a shortage of balances  but late in the day in new york the funds rate often fell well below target as domestic banks that held largerthannormal balances during the day tried to sell fed funds rather than hold big noninterestbearing balances overnight
while our current regime keeps the funds rate close to target on average it imposes sizable and unnecessary burdens  as noted on page 23 dis use real resources to run sweep programs and to carefully manage each days balance in their federal reserve accounts  while those efforts generate private gains they are a waste from a social perspective  even with sweep programs the opportunity cost of holding unremunerated reserve balances averaged about 360 million per year during the past two years  in addition the banking system and the federal reserve spend many millions of dollars each year to ensure and monitor compliance with complex reserve requirement rules
as indicated on page 24 our current approach to implementing monetary policy has strengths  it usually keeps the funds rate close to target and it supports an active interbank market  but our current approach also has shortcomings  it allows occasional large deviations of the funds rate from target even in normal times and morefrequent large deviations when interbank markets are disrupted  our approach is less than transparent even wellinformed market participants sometimes are surprised by the desks daily operations and there was widespread misunderstanding of the desks actions last august  finally our current approach imposes burdens that simply are not necessary to enable the desk to keep the funds rate close to target
theory and foreign experience suggest that it is possible to reduce the shortcomings of the current us approach to implementing monetary policy without sacrificing its strengths  jim clouse and spence hilton will now discuss a range of options for improving the us approach
mr clouse  thanks steve  as noted on page 25 the interest on reserves workgroup developed a set of options for monetary policy implementation in the united states based on alternative settings for a small set of core structural elements the first core elementsocalled balance targetsis a central feature of many systems  in the united states japan switzerland and the euro area balance targets are established through mandatory reserve requirements  in the united kingdom balance targets are established through voluntary contractual arrangements  other countries such as canada and australia operate with no formal balance targets
target bands are a second structural element incorporated in many systems to afford banks some flexibility in meeting their targets  the carryover provisions for required reserves and the clearing band for required clearing balances play this role in the united states  the structure of the maintenance period is another core structural element  as steve noted the us system operates with a mixture of oneweek and twoweek maintenance periods  the united kingdom and the euro area operate with maintenance periods that correspond to the interval between monetary policy meetings  central banks like the bank of canada and reserve bank of australia that operate without balance targets implicitly operate with a oneday maintenance period
finally most systems involve some form of interest rate corridor with the upper bound of the corridor established by a standing lending facility and the lower bound set by the rate of remuneration on excess reserves or a redeposit facility
as noted on page 26 market developments may at times impair the efficacy of one or more of these core structural elements  for example the standing lending facility should in theory establish a cap on interbank rates  however the presence of stigma in using the standing lending facility can impair the effectiveness of the  cap  that certainly seems to have been the case in the united states over recent months  we have observed depository institutions regularly bidding for funds in the market at rates above the primary credit rate  the table at the bottom reports some evidence on this score culled from data on fedwire transactions  over recent weeks many of the largest banks in the country have executed numerous trades for sizable amounts at rates well above the primary credit rate  it may be possible to redesign the discount window to mitigate stigma to some extent but it appears likely that stigma will continue to be an issue for the discount window especially during periods of financial distress  as a result systems that rely heavily on a standing lending facility to establish an upper bound on the federal funds rate implicitly disadvantage those institutions that are most wary about using the discount window  as you can see in the table that set of institutions in the united states includes many that are critical providers of liquidity across a range of markets  it is noteworthy in this regard that citibank in the past has been willing to provide liquidity in the funds market by borrowing primary credit and relending the proceeds in the funds market  however in recent weeks citi has seemed reluctant to pursue this strategy and has in fact executed more than 100 trades from late march through last week in sizable amounts at rates above the primary credit rate  indeed the three largest banks in the country shown in the first three rowsall appear to be quite wary about using the discount window
as noted on page 27 it is helpful broadly speaking to think about the five options discussed in the paper as falling into two basic categoriessystems that incorporate a multipleday maintenance period and systems in which depositories manage their reserves to meet a daily reserve objective  the multipleday systems options 1 and 2 in the paperrely on arbitrage across days of a maintenance period as an important factor contributing to daytoday funds rate stability  singleday systems tend to rely more heavily on standing facilities and the structure of remuneration rates on reserves to stabilize the funds rate  the next few slides focus on multipleday systems
option 1  as noted on page 28 option 1 considers a straightforward modification of our current system of monetary policy implementation  required reserve balances would be remunerated at a rate close to the target funds rate  the primary credit facility in theory anyway would establish the upper bound of an interest rate corridor  the lower bound of the corridor would be established by paying interest on excess reserves at a rate appreciably below the target funds rate  the solid line in the picture displays what the demand for reserves might look like on the last day of the
reserve maintenance period  the curve would be downward sloping and might entail some precautionary demand for excess reserves  the reserve demand curve on previous days in the maintenance periodthe dotted linewould be much flatter at the target rate over a wide range reflecting the ability of banks to substitute balances across days of the maintenance period in meeting reserve requirements  eventually though at very low levels of balances the increased risk of an overnight overdraft would push the intraperiod demand curve up to the primary credit rate  at high levels of balances the intraperiod demand curve would eventually fall to the remuneration rate on excess reserves as banks recognized that they held excess balances that could not be worked off by the end of the maintenance period  the width of the flat portion of the intraperiod demand curve tends to narrow over the maintenance period as the scope for substitution diminishes across the remaining days of the period  in this structure the desk would operate much as it does today supplying an aggregate quantity of reserve balances each day to address both daily demands and
maintenanceperiod average needs
option 2  as noted on page 29 option 2 in the paper is a multipleday system based on voluntary balance targets rather than mandatory reserve requirements  this system would share many of the key structural elements of the system for monetary policy implementation employed in the united kingdom  depository institutions would establish a voluntary balance target that they would agree to meet on average over a maintenance period  the maintenance period could be set equal to the interval between fomc meetings  the system could include a target balance band to afford banks some flexibility in meeting their voluntary target balance as shown on the right the demand for reserves on the last day of the period would again be downward sloping and the desk would supply an aggregate quantity of reserves equal to the quantity demanded at the target funds rate  reserve management and the funds market under this option probably would be similar to that for option 1  the longer maintenance period might allow depository institutions more scope for substitution of balances across days of the maintenance period  that could imply less need for daily finetuning of balances and greater funds rate stability  a key issue however is whether the aggregate quantity of voluntary balance targets would be large enough to provide adequate leeway for effective arbitrage across days of the maintenance period  many banks might choose not to establish a voluntary balance target in this system and those that do may not choose to establish a large balance target  in this case the funds rate could be fairly volatile within the interest rate corridor
option 3  as noted on page 30 option 3 in the paperthe simple corridoris similar to the systems employed by the bank of canada and the reserve bank of australia  banks would not need to establish a balance target of any sort and would simply manage their accounts each day to balance the opportunity cost of holding reserves against the risk of overnight overdrafts  the system would involve a fairly narrow symmetric funds rate corridor  as noted in the figure the desk would supply reserves each day equal to the quantity demanded along the downward sloping portion of the demand curve  because the demand curve is likely to be fairly steep
shocks to reserve supply are likely to result in significant volatility in the funds rate within the corridor  as noted earlier the heavy reliance on the primary credit facility to establish an upper bound on the funds rate may be suspect especially during periods of financial distress
option 4  as noted on page 31 option 4 in the paper is a system similar in many respects to that employed by the reserve bank of new zealand  key structural features of this system include an asymmetric interest rate corridor and a relatively high level of balances to ensure that the funds rate trades near the floor of the interest rate corridor  as in option 3 depositories would not need to establish a balance target of any sort  the reserve demand curve for this system might look like that shown to the right  at low levels of balances the demand curve would be downward sloping reflecting precautionary demands for balances to avoid overnight overdrafts  but at sufficiently high levels of balances the risk of overnight overdrafts should become very low and the demand curve would asymptote near the floor of the funds rate corridor  it is difficult to estimate the level of balances that would be necessary to reach this point but an aggregate level of balances on the order of 50 billion would probably be sufficient in most cases  in principle fluctuations in various factors affecting reserves would not have much effect on the funds rate and the generally high level of balances could reduce daylight overdrafts  partly because of the experience in new zealand there are questions about incentives for strategic behavior in this structure
option 5  as noted on page 32 option 5 is a hybrid singleday system that would involve a voluntary daily balance target and a relatively wide target band
depositories would receive full remuneration on balances maintained up to the upper bound of the target band and would be penalized for any shortfall in balances below the lower bound of the target band  with these structural elements the reserve demand curve should be fairly flat at the target rate over a wide range but the curve would be downward sloping near the upper and lower bounds of the target balance band  the desk would presumably operate by targeting a quantity of balances each day near the middle of the target band  as with option 2 a significant issue with option 5 would be whether depositories would choose a high enough level of voluntary balance targets to allow the target band to play the desired role in stabilizing the federal funds rate
as noted on page 33 the paper also identifies a number of general issues that cut across all the options  first depository institutions will still be subject to statutory limitations on their ability to pay interest on demand deposits  as a result the federal reserves initiative to pay interest on reserves may be seen by correspondent banks as unfair competition  there are also technical issues associated with the setting of the remuneration rates on reserve balances that appropriately account for the essentially riskfree nature of balances held with the central bank  the federal reserve would need to work through governance issues associated with all the options  in particular the board is responsible for setting all remuneration rates on balances and this would need to be closely coordinated with the fomcs
determination of the target federal funds rate  finally many if not all the options discussed would likely require some transition period that would need to be carefully managed  spence will now discuss some of the pros and cons of each option in more detail and how they stack up relative to key objectives
mr hilton  thank you jim  we have identified four critical objectives for a new operating framework which are listed on page 34 of your handout  these are
1 to reduce burdens and deadweight loss associated with the current regime 2 to enhance monetary policy implementation 3 to promote efficient and resilient money markets and 4 to promote an efficient payment system  for each of the five options that jim has just presented i am going to describe what we see as the major advantages and disadvantages of each vis  vis these objectives  i will also highlight some important sources of uncertainty that we have about how some of these options might function in practice  then i will close with a broad assessment of how the five options measure up against each of these four objectives
the key advantages and disadvantages of option 1remunerate required and excess reserve balancesare listed on page 35  this option would have the advantage of being relatively easy to implement given that it would build largely on elements of the current operating framework and would simply pay interest on reserve requirements and at a lower rate on excess reserves  the basic framework which consists of an interest rate corridor with reserve requirements and maintenance periods is widely used by other central banks and were pretty certain how it would function in practice  for central banks that have adopted this basic framework it has proven to be reasonably effective for controlling shortterm interbank rates under a variety of circumstances  however this option would do little to reduce the administrative burdens associated with our current regime  this framework is also somewhat rigid particularly in the flexibility it would provide to us and to banks themselves to adjust the level of requirements in ways that would facilitate monetary policy implementation  a particular shortcoming is that many depositories active in the interbank market have a very small base of deposits against which requirements of any level could be assessed  an important source of uncertainty with this option is whether it would lead to a significant increase in total required operating balances which would be helpful for damping interest rate fluctuations that can arise when requirements are very low  however the fed would have some power to influence the aggregate level of requirements by raising requirement ratios
option 2voluntary balance targetsshown on page 36 would lead to some reduction of administrative costs and burdens compared with the current framework option 1 as relative simplicity would be one of the principal design objectives for a new system of voluntary reserve targets  the basic framework is similar to that of option 1  it consists of an interest rate corridor with maintenance periods but substitutes voluntary targets for reserve requirements  as already noted this basic framework has proven to be reasonably effective for controlling overnight interbank rates where it has been adopted  furthermore a new system of voluntary targets could provide all dis with considerable flexibility for setting their own level of
targets and for adjusting the size of these targets a feature that banks might find useful during periods of heightened uncertainty or stress  with this option there would also be the opportunity to review and totally revamp the length and mechanics of the maintenance period to make them more supportive of monetary policy implementation  however almost any system of voluntary targets for reserves is bound to impose some administrative costs on both depositories and the fed and there may be some tradeoff between administrative simplicity and design flexibility an important source of uncertainty with this option is that we have yet to identify with precision a system of voluntary reserve targets that would be workable in the sense of being easy to administer across a large number of dis with disparate structures and that would be effective in yielding a total level and distribution of voluntary targets across dis that would enhance our ability to achieve our operating objectives  unfortunately experiences of other central banks offer little guidance in how to design voluntary targets  a particular risk that concerned the bank of  england when it designed its voluntary target scheme was the potential for market manipulation that a new system might offer individual banks if they were entirely free to choose their level
option 3simple corridoron page 37 would go about as far as possible toward eliminating administrative burdens by doing away with all requirements and maintenance period accounting rules  this option should also keep the overnight interbank rate within a narrower range than the other options assuming that we adopt a narrower spread between the discount rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves  experiences of other central banks that have adopted this kind of operating system support that belief  however there is also reason to believe that with removal of the ability of banks to average reserve holdings over a maintenance period interest rate volatility within the interest rate corridor could be high  we could respond to high volatility within a corridor by further narrowing that corridor but there is the risk that at some point as you go in that direction market participants could use our discount window or interest on excess reserves as a first recourse rather than as a last resort and thus affect the feds role as intermediary and impair normal market functioning  there are some important questions about how effectively a simple corridor system would function in our particular environment  all the options we are considering propose to use the primary credit facility to limit upward movements in market rates  to the extent that this facility might not serve as an effective brake on upward rate movements the consequences would be greatest for this option because there are no other mechanisms for smoothing interest rates  some central banks that have a simple corridor framework have also developed arrangements to adjust reserve levels late in the day to prevent exogenous reserve shocks from pushing market rates to either the upper or the lower end of the corridor
option 4floor with high balancesis shown on page 38  it would also do away with all requirements and maintenance period accounting rules and like option 3 would go a long way toward eliminating administrative burdens  moreover because the rate effects of even a large aggregate reserve shock or a payment shock at an individual di are likely to be relatively small the need for depositories or for the
desk to manage daily reserve positions intensively is likely to be reduced which should translate to further resource savings  better insulation of market rates from exogeneous reserve shocks is a design objective and it is a particularly distinctive feature of this framework  however completely severing the link between daily reserve levels and interest rate movements can be a doubleedged sword  while we may wish to better insulate market rates from reserve shocks we may also wish to preserve some ability to influence market rates by manipulating reserve supply when other factors are distorting rates  one risk associated with this option is that it would represent a radical departure from the basic elements of our own current framework and from those of almost every other central bank preventing us from learning from the experiences of other central banks  a particular unknown with this option is the possible implication for the functioning of the interbank market  offering to compensate dis for all the reserves they might choose to hold at a rate that is in line with market rates could have profound effects on their willingness to lend in the market under both normal circumstances and during periods of market stress  the reserve bank of new zealand one central bank that has experimented with a system similar to option 4 did run into some difficulties with the hoarding of reserves by individual banks to the detriment of the interbank market  as a result they adjusted their framework to cap holdings of excess reserves by individual banks
option 5voluntary daily target with clearing bandis on page 39  it has many of the same advantages and disadvantages as option 2 stemming from the fact that both feature voluntary reserve targets  because simplicity would be one of the design principles it should reduce current administrative burdens  it would also provide dis with the same kind of flexibility that option 2 does for setting and adjusting their own reserve targets  on the other hand a system of voluntary targets for reserves would still leave some administrative costs and we have yet to specify a system of voluntary reserve targets that would be workable and effective  an additional advantage of this option is that it could allow the fed to adjust the width of the daily clearing band around the reserve target  the final choice of clearing band width could be made after some experimentation based on what works best  moreover being able to make temporary adjustments to the width of this daily clearing band could be a powerful tool for dealing with exigent circumstances  experiences of other central banks provide little guidance about how this flexibility might be best employed  but the bank of england did widen its maintenance period clearing band during the recent financial market turmoil and they have been happy with the results  interestingly the ecb quite independently has been examining the possibility of a new system centered on a oneday clearing band rather than a multiday maintenance period
let me sum up by outlining how these five options stack up against the four objectives that we have established for a new operating framework which are summarized on pages 40 and 41  first all the options would eliminate most of the current reserve tax associated with the nonpayment of interest on reserves and perhaps with the exception of option 1 they would reduce the administrative burdens associated with our current framework  option 3 simple corridor and option 4 floor with high balances would do the most to eliminate these administrative costs
second all the options would improve monetary policy implementation by helping set a floor on the fed funds rate  most have additional features that could help control rate volatility although these differ from one another in terms of their mechanics  but some of the options offer greater potential to adjust parameters in ways that could be helpful amid changing circumstancessay during periods of market stress or heightened uncertainty about developments that could affect our balance sheet  an adjustable clearing band in option 5 could offer considerable flexibility  adjustable reserve targets a feature of both options 2 and 5 are another possibility
third all the options would rely on efficient money markets for distributing reserves between dis  there is more uncertainty however about how some of the options might influence the incentive structure for trading and the allocation of liquidity in shortterm financing markets and the role of the central bank in that process  this is the case with option 3 simple corridor should that corridor be too narrow and with option 4 floor with high balances where the choices of lending excess liquidity in the market versus holding excess reserves would be nearly equivalent
fourth all the options are compatible with the proposed changes in payment system policies  however there are differences among the options in the levels of reserves that would likely be in place and that could serve as a substitute for the provision of central bank daylight credit  option 4 floor with high balances would provide the most reserves in the system and option 3 simple corridor would provide the fewest perhaps even lower than current levels  a system of voluntary reserve targets a feature of both options 2 and 5 could be deliberately designed to encourage a relatively high level of reserves
mr dudley  building on the earlier presentations i am going to focus briefly on four areas  first id like to put the interest on reserves project in the broader context of monetary policy implementation  second i will discuss briefly the implications of our experience during the recent market turmoil in terms of how it might influence our choices in this project  third ill suggest some next steps and a potential timeline  fourth ill focus on the criteria for evaluating the different options and those areas where your guidance will likely be particularly important
turning to page 42 of the handout the issue of paying interest on reserves should be placed in a broader context  in particular this project should be considered as part of the process of improving the overall monetary policy framework  put bluntly although the current system works very well during normal times we have found it recently to be less robust during times of stress  as a result we should use this opportunity to strengthen the robustness of the framework
so what are the weaknesses of the current monetary policy framework  as shown on page 43 of the handout four come immediately to mind  1 in times of
stress the federal funds rate can be very volatileboth daytoday and intraday
2 on the upside the primary credit facility rate is not a binding ceiling on rates
3 when there is a large reserve adding miss the desk can temporarily lose control of the federal funds rate target to the downside  4 stability in the federal funds rate may not limit upward pressure in term funding rates  today ill focus on the volatility issue and the failure of the pcf rate to be a binding cap  two issues are worth noting regarding volatility  first the federal funds rate has become more volatile on a daytoday basis since last august  this can be seen on page 44 second the federal funds rate has become very volatile intraday  the exhibit on page 45 shows how wide the range of federal funds rate trading has been recently  the vertical dashed lines indicate the daily range  note that the primary credit facility rate has not acted as a firm cap on the upper end of the daily range
as shown on page 46 these shortcomings suggest that paying interest on reserves should be considered in tandem with other changes to the overall monetary policy framework  we should be willing to make significant adjustments to our monetary policy framework so that it is more robust during times of stress  in this context although option 1 paying interest on required and excess reserves and option 2 eliminating reserve requirements are attractive because both would eliminate the reserve tax distortion they do not do much in terms of making the monetary policy framework more robust  that said option 2 has a number of favorable features  it is voluntary and would lessen the regulatory burden  we have considerable experience with this type of framework so the risks of unintended consequences might be lower than for some of the other options  the bank of england has been using this framework successfully and it has proven to be reasonably robust through this period of market turmoil  nevertheless we may wish to be more ambitious
turning to page 47 option 5 voluntary daily target with clearing band is potentially more robust than option 3 or option 4  in part this is because it is very flexible  this proposal has a number of parameters that can be adjustedfor example the width of the corridor and the size of the voluntary reserve band  thus this option has the advantage that it could be modified relatively easily in light of experience or in response to changing market conditions  the biggest shortcoming of option 5 is that no other central bank has adopted such a model  thus experience and empirical evidence are lacking compared with the other proposals
so what is our recommendation in terms of pushing this forward see page 48
as jim noted in his presentation the five options can be broken down into two classes  options 1 and 2 operate in a framework of a multipleday reserve maintenance period  options 3 4 and 5 are singleday systems  reserve maintenance periods have both advantages and disadvantages  reserve maintenance periods reduce volatility by averagingwhich can be a good thing  but there is a cost  the shocks can persist  in contrast in singleday systems each day is a new start so one avoids the problem of a large shock contaminating an entire reserve maintenance period  this suggests that a reasonable next step might be to develop the best proposal within each of these two broad classes  we recommend focusing on
option 2 as the best proposal within a reserve maintenance framework and option 5 as the best proposal in a singleday system
what would be the next steps see page 49  first we would need to identify workable systems of voluntary targets for reserves needed for either option 2 or option 5  this would include setting clear objectives for the aggregate size and the distribution across depository institutions and how such a system would be applied to a heterogeneous banking system  second we would need to critically assess the relative merits of maintenance periods versus daily clearing bands  in this context we would need to determine the optimal length of a reserve maintenance period and the width of a clearing band  third we would have to define the optimal width of a rate corridor under both options  here we would have to understand the implications for rate dynamics and the functioning of the market during normal conditions and during times of stress  finally we would need to assess whether the options were compatible or could be made compatible with other changes that we might implement such as changes in our counterparties or in the types of collateral we accept as part of our central bank operations
so what would be a possible timeline between now and implementation in october 2011  the timeline that i will discuss should be viewed as tentative and subject to revision in light of your comments and further discussion within the federal reserve system  turning to page 50 we would propose that most of the remainder of 2008 be used for an extensive study of the options  in may 2008 the staff would publish a white paper on possible approaches for public comment  in december the staff would propose a specific approach to the board and to the fomc  continuing on page 51 the first half of 2009 would be spent filling in the details with the final proposal published for public comment in august 2009  the rules implementing the proposal would be published by the board in october 2009 the final two years would be spent preparing for october 2011 implementation
on the last page we outline areas in which we particularly seek your guidance these include the following questions  do you agree with our metrics for evaluation of the policy options  in particular what are the appropriate weights to place on the reduction in burden and distortions versus the other criteria  which options should be studied further  are you comfortable with our proposed timeline  finally how do you view the interaction of the interest on reserves project with other issuesfor example collateralized daylight overdrafts  we would now like to open the floor for questions and comments
chairman bernanke  well let me first congratulate and compliment the staff for a
really thorough piece of work both the presenters and all the other people whom brian mentioned
it is excellent work particularly under very trying circumstances  i mentioned that in february a
workshop was held here at the board on monetary policy implementation which brought together
people from major central banks around the world  so there has been a very very serious attempt to
evaluate others experience  thank you very much for all of that  why dont we take some
questions first if there are any  then anyone who would like to make comments can do so  any
questions  president hoenig do you have a question sir
mr hoenig  yes  option 1 doesnt seem to be one of your recommendations and yet it
is something that basically people know how to do  the idea is to eliminate the pack so that you
have the system already in place  its simple you can learn from it  why wouldnt that be one of
the options youd pursue  i dont have any real opposition to option 2 but i was just curious
because the transition seemed so simple with option 1  that is the question
mr madigan  president hoenig i would say that we believe we already have a fairly
good sense as to how paying interest on the required reserve balances and on excess reserves would
work at least qualitatively  we do think it would be an acceptable means of implementing
monetary policy  as jim noted it probably wouldnt be all that different in terms of monetary
policy effectiveness from the way things work now  of course as we also emphasized the current
system of reserve requirements has a lot of problems  admittedly paying interest on required
reserve balances in some sense solves the firstorder problem but there are lots of costs associated
with the system of reserve requirements that weve discussed and we think that those may warrant
serious consideration of eliminating reserve requirements  but to be clear were not suggesting that
we rule out option 1 at this stage  we could certainly view it as a fallback position for instance
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  id like to understand this issue in terms of the voluntary targets  how are
they deciding on these  clearly a big part of the issue is whether or not they choose you  i was just
completely confused about what their considerations in choosing these numbers would be and what
implications that would have  now there is experience for that one case  im sure you have views
on this but its sort of the black box in this proposal and its a really important part of it
the second question regards the corridor approach  i do not think it is a good model for us
because the countries that use it have very few banks  the issue of using the central bank as a
financial intermediary is less of a problem for them because there are fewer guys that they have to
look at and we have to look at a zillion people  but is it true that they have high volatility  im not
sure  i just would like to know the facts but as i say i dont think its critical  i dont think the
experience there even if it worked well really does tell us that we should do something here
mr madigan  maybe i could just take the second question and spence or jim may
want to take the first  on the corridor approach for other countries that are using itim thinking
of the bank of canada in particular heretheir institutional setup allows them extremely precise
control over the supply of reserves  also the demand for reservesim talking about reserve
balancesis considerably less uncertain than in the united states  part of it comes from the fact
that they have only a handful of large banks
mr mishkin  it is five or six banks right
mr madigan  so the communication with banks regarding their reserve management is
extremely simple compared with what we could expect here in the united states
mr clouse  the determination of voluntary targets as spence mentioned is a really big
issue that wed have to study much further  at least in the context of the simple models banks will
face some probability of an overdraft charge if they are operating with very low balances so they
might have an incentive to set up a voluntary requirement on which they receive remuneration  on
the other hand they may not view even fully remunerated balances as an especially attractive asset
so there might be some balancing between the desire to hold large enough requirements to stay
away from overdrafts and the idea of having balances or assets booked that arent particularly high
earning  but this is a major uncertainty for these types of models
mr mishkin  the bank of england has used a procedure like this  what has been their
experience  again it may not be completely comparable
mr hilton  well for the bank of england the way the voluntary target rules are set is
really very simple  the bank chooses its own voluntary target  it cant be below zero of course
but they have a cap  it cant be any higher than a certain amount and i think its 2 percent of some
measure of their liabilities on their balance sheet  they were extremely worried  they had no idea
what they were going to get  their experience was encouraging in that they got an aggregate level
and a distribution that have brilliantly facilitated their control over their interbank market  but it is
sort of taking a leap to go into that system although we have some experience with our clearing
balance program  we do see how banks adjust their participation with reservemanagement
objectives in mind  in our case because there are practical limitsceilings on the size of a clearing
balance that makes sense for any bank to havewe dont really have a direct observation of what
we would get if it were entirely voluntary  the evidence that i see from our experience of clearing
balances and from the bank of england is encouraging that we would get even with a very simply
designed set of voluntary targets a good aggregate level and distribution of voluntary targets  but
right now based on what we know it is an uncertainty
mr dudley  the big risk would be if the voluntary balances were really low
mr mishkin  so lets say that actually happened that they were zero  then what  lets
say we implemented this and they came out at zero  what are our options
mr dudley  youd have to change the incentives somehow
mr mishkin  right and that would be the answer
mr dudley  but you could  you could raise the cost of daylight overdrafts
mr mishkin  right  you could raise the cost of daylight overdrafts or you could adjust
the interest rate that you pay on reserves to get it right  that could solve the problem
mr dudley  as long as you have enough parameters that you can adjust to change the
incentives youre probably going to be okay in that environment  but if you have a system in
which there arent any parameters that you can actually move then you have a real problem
mr mishkin  but in the context of the law we would have the ability to adjust these
parameters
mr madigan  governor mishkin to state the obvious wed want to avoid that situation
completely  we want preparation and consultation with banks ex ante as to how they would react
under various subparameterizations
mr mishkin  okay  thank you
mr clouse  as steve noted we already have 7 billion in required clearing balances
with a rate of remuneration thats only 80 percent of the tbill rate  so in all likelihood we would
have a positive number  how large that number would be is the question mark
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  i have a comment not a question
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you  this represents a onceinageneration opportunity to
reengineer our monetary policy operational framework and i think its important that we do our
best to get it right  i want to start by applauding the staff for taking a very deliberate very
thoughtful approach to this project  i was able to attend the workshop on foreign central banks
operations  i found it very illuminating instructive well organized and well thought out  so far
the work has been well organized and the broadbased involvement has been very good  i want to
compliment you on sifting down  the combinatorics must have been mindboggling given the
number of free parameters in the design of one of these schemes  i want to applaud you for boiling
it down to a good representative set that spans everything that i think wed want to consider  what
you producedwith one slight exception that ill talk about in a bitis a very thorough and careful
analysis
in richmond we have thought about the issue of interest on reserves for many many
yearseven before the congress considered it  toward the end im going to argue that option 4
deserves serious consideration and id like to see you focus on that as well as the other options
going forward  before i do though i want to comment briefly on the objectives  you asked for
feedback on this  in particular i think objective 3 needs to be interpreted very carefully  the report
often seems to interpret objective 3 as implying that anything that reduces the amount of lending in
the fed funds market must reduce financial market efficiency  i just dont think thats right
the prohibition of interest on reserves is obviously a tax on reserve holdings  you have
focused on the tax that it implies on reservable liabilities but the fact that we also dont pay interest
on excess reserves is a tax on excess reserve holdings  if we eliminate reserve requirements and we
still dont pay interest on reserves well still be taxing reserve holdings  that gives rise to
inefficiencies for the same reason that the lack of interest on currency gives rise to inefficiencies
and so in this setting obviously banks do a lot of things to avoid the reserve tax  some of the
measures involve a lot of monitoring of the reserve account monitoring of the prospective payment
flow and making sure that they can predict where theyre going to be at the end of the day
but some of the measures undoubtedly involve some transactionssuch as fed funds loans
purchases of treasury securities repo lending and the likethat are aimed at minimizing their non
interestearning balances  such transactions are exactly analogous to the classic shoeleather costs
of inflation  additional transactions that are induced by the tax on currency are a waste  reducing
the inflation tax results in fewer trips to the bank or to the atm to get money out and that reduction
is a good thing not a bad thing  it would be a benefit and that is exactly what it means to reduce
the dead weight burden of inflation  similarly i think that paying interest on excess reserves will
reduce transaction volumes in the fed funds market but we should count that as a benefit not a cost
put more generally the effectiveness of a market isnt the same as the quantity of transactions
i bring this up because one of the main objections to option 4 at least in the reportit didnt
appear in the slidesis that it could reduce fed funds market lending  i think it should be obvious at
this point why that wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing  its sort of like saying that reducing
inflation would be a bad thing because people would make fewer trips to the bank  i dont think
youd say that
even if we believed that fed funds volume is important i think a quick look at the numbers
would suggest that its not likely to be that big a problem  the staff estimates that the fed funds
market is about 225 billion on average  so how much by way of reserves will we need to add to
ensure a negligible chance that our autonomous reserve factor drains reserves enough to drive the
funds rate up  you showed a graph and there was a flat spot and you had supply way way way
out on the curve  but it doesnt need to go out that far  it just needs to go out so that youd know
that youre not going to accidentally go in on the upward part  my reading of your intermeeting
report is that reserve misses are typically on the order of 1 billion or 2 billion  i think the average
absolute value is about 990 million  two is pretty rare  it happens every now and then  so it
seems as though 5 billion would do plenty  the report says that 35 billion would be how much
reserves youd need to add  im a little curious about where that number came from  its hard for
me to believe wed need that much  but certainly more broadly than that if you think about the
market is that right now 225 billion in lending is going on  if you do the thought experiments
about current equilibriums and you are a bank that just walks into the market and needs some
reserves will it be hard to get reserves  well youre going to run into 225 billion worth from
banks that are already lending their reserves with interest  so if youre going to get your loan
youre going to have to pay a competitive rate and shake loose some money from one of them  if
we are paying interest on 35 billion in reserves will that change that calculus much  i dont think
so  i think that your markets are still going to work the same way  if you want reserves youre
going to have to pay a competitive rate for them  if youre not getting reserves at that rate youre
going to bid up until you get them  so i just dont quite get this concern about the volume of
transactions in the funds market
a related objection is the issue of hoardingthe idea that one bank might decide to hold a
whole bunch of reserves  the staff cited the example of new zealand  i thought that was a really
interesting discussion at the workshop  one bank accumulated 8 billion or 9 billion in reserves i
think it was which was large for them and they had to add a large amount of reserves to
accommodate that demand plus the demand of other banks in the system  now the problem for the
bank of new zealand is as i understand it that the government doesnt issue debt  when they
have to issue deposits they have to acquire foreign exchange reserves and that involves a fiscal risk
that theyre reluctant to take on  my sense of the conversation is that they dont like to accumulate
foreign exchange reserves  we seem to be quite willing to expand our balance sheet  plus there are
plenty of government securities around  so i just dont see why it would be a problem for us if
reserve demand was unexpectedly high or some bank decided to hold 50 billion in reserves
i want to talk about one more thing which is the issue of the rate  the way you have written
it up is that what we target now is the average rate of brokered deposits  you said it was 80 billion
to 100 billion out of 225 billion on averageso less than half the marketjust the weighted
average of trades during the day that go through brokered channels  that doesnt include direct
credit funds  the approach you envisioned is that we try to set a remuneration rate so that the
effective rate that average comes out at the target rate that the committee sets  a very natural
alternative it seems to meand i think this is the way the bank of england does itis that our
policy rate is now the deposit rate  when we issue a press release we say were changing the policy
ratei dont know whether or not we would rename it
now you folks estimate that the risk premium that would on average be the gap between
this deposit rate and this effective fed funds rate you measure might be 10 basis points  we now set
the funds rate target in  point increments  in theory we could set our policy rate 10 basis points
below  point increments  that seems a little bizarre  im not sure that we have such precise
confidence in the optimal funds rate that wed know that it should be on the  point and not
10 basis points below or above  it strikes me that a natural version of option 4 or any of these
options would be to set the remuneration rate at  point increments and have that be the policy rate
and just make that the reference point for how we do  admittedly econometricians would have to
do a lot of work in the future to splice these series together but i think thats a workable alternative
we ought to think about
i think that option 4 has some obvious benefits over the other options  intuitively if you
were given a limited budget and were asked to peg the price of a commodityminimize the
variance of a commodity price around a given targetyour natural inclination would be to stand
ready to buy and sell that commodity at the target price  that would be right out of the box the
first thing every economist would say  option 4 is the closest practical analogue to that  its clean
its simple  i think its eminently workable  i just dont see the force of the objections  in
comparison option 5 which is the one that comes closest to option 4 involves the monitoring of
voluntary targets  you have to monitor these bands  you have to check the balances every night
against the bands  it just seems like a lot of superfluous machinery
option 4 would go furthest toward reducing our dependence on forecasting uncertain
autonomous factors  it would also go furthest toward solving the problem that the primary dealer
credit facility has given rise to which has been particularly acute in the last intermeeting period
which is that rates are firm  youve done a pretty good job with the average daily rate but it
crashes at the end of every day  more than half the time you look at the low for the day and its
under 1 percent  its like  percent  so we have a chronic intraday problem of rates being firm and
then crashing because you dont know  primary dealers come in that stuff goes on the market and
the rate crashes
i think option 4 would also be the most transparent approach  it would be the easiest to
explain to people  it would go furthest toward eliminating the risk of the downside target misses
and concerns about stealth easing  option 4 would also facilitate longrun moves toward lesser
lines of daylight central bank credit and i think thats an important consideration  it shouldnt be
the deciding consideration but it is important  in terms of the timeline you have yourselves
focusing on two options before the results of the public comment come in  to some extent thats
prejudging where the public comment is going to come in  so in short option 4 strikes me as the
most straightforward and practical way to do it and id urge that we direct the group which has
done great work so far to focus on option 4 and to keep it as a live option  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  just a procedural question  you kind of segued
into the positions  does anyone have a short question of fact  governor kohn
mr kohn  i actually have a couple of questions rather than positions  one is a bit more
about what weve learned in this period of stress  for example on page 26 you list a bunch of
banks that dont seem to have taken advantage of primary credit  i assume that you have talked to
them and i wonder how they had rationalized their concerns about stigma and what they said about
that  along similar lines about stress and following up on governor mishkins question how did
the uk system work in this period of stress  my impression is that they had problems  initially
the banks wanted to increase their voluntary targets and that required the bank of england to be a
little more flexible than it started out to be  id be interested in how option 2 behaved under stress
and then any new insights you have about bank behavior in this period that produced the oscillations
that we saw
a second point is that brian scott and i have been talking about asking the congress to
allow us to pay interest on reserves sooner rather than later  are we pursuing that  if we got that
authority i assume that it would not involve implementing this over four years but that we could
implement something in one or two weeks in the maintenance period after we got that authority
how would you go about that  what are you thinking in that regard  i think ill stop there
mr madigan  if i may start with the last question we can work our way up or around
the list  on pursuing legislative authority the federal reserve is interested in accelerating that
authority  we have had some conversations with congressional staff about this  for instance the
staff of senate minority leader mcconnell has asked us recently whether wed be interested in
legislation to accelerate the authority  of course we responded enthusiastically  we did say to
them that it would be helpful if it were clear that we could use that authority in such a way as to be
able to pay interest on excess reserves or rather to buy federal funds as a way of paying interest on
excess reserves in effect  buying federal funds when the rate is falling would help us put a floor
under the funds rate  so we would want to be sureperhaps scott wants to comment on thisthat
the legislation clearly permitted that  presumably we would be able to use that authority fairly
quickly at an operational levelbill or spence may want to comment on this
paying interest on required reserve balances is of course a whole other matter  that
involves complicated systems and we would simply want to be sure that we made this clear to the
congressional staffs that it would take a longer time before we could implement that
mr dudley  we think we could implement it pretty quickly  another benefit would be
not just addressing the crashes of the funds rate late in the day but also enabling us to actually
expand our balance sheet if needed
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  just to clarify what are the implications for scoring
mr dudley  its pretty small if you just confine it to excess
mr madigan  my impression is as bill said that it is small and there may not even be
positive costs if you confine it to excess  the issues of paying interest on required reserves are
possibly a little more troublesome but that may be viewed as a worthwhile cost to undertake at this
point
chairman bernanke  let me interject  if theres a sense of the committee that this
is something we should escalate lets move it up the ladder and do that  but anyone who wants to
comment on that during the goaround please feel free  there was a second part about the united
kingdom i believe
mr meyer  with respect to the uk system during the period of turmoil banks initial
reaction was to lower their reserve deposits their contractual commitments  but they came to their
senses and realized that holding more rather than less was a more sensible approach and the bank
of england accommodated the banks desire both to increase their targets and to widen the bands
mr dudley  pretty dramatically in fact
mr meyer  quite dramatically to avoid the endofperiod spike in rates  in terms of
rate volatility the bank of england the ecb and the fed all achieved about the same rate volatility
during the period of market turmoil  for the bank of england the spikes just tended to be more on
the upside than the downside but that had to do with their implementation procedures and not
getting to the end of the period and being willing to accommodate
mr kohn  i assume it was the stigma problem as well
mr meyer  though they had a few trades above their lending rate in fact that was not
much of a problem  their system worked quite well  interestingly the country with the smallest
rate volatility during the whole period of market turmoil was canada and thats because they knew
the demand for balances at the end of every day and could adjust the supply by adjusting the
government balance at the end of every day  so they hit it basically every day
chairman bernanke  other short questions  president fisher
mr fisher  a very short question having nothing to do with what everybody else has
asked aboutbut going back to page 33 what are the governance issues and how do you resolve
them in 30 seconds or less  laughter
mr madigan  well the governance issues are that the fomc is in charge of open
market operations and setting the target for the federal funds rate at least under current approaches
to policy  the legislation specifies that the board is in charge of setting the rates paid on balances to
institutions  for instance there may be differential rates as in option 1 on required reserve balances
and excess reserve balances  presumably if we went with option 1 for instance one approach
would be to simply set them by formula relative to the target federal funds rate  we dont mean to
say that this is likely to be an enormously large issue at least in some of the options but it ought to
be handled carefully
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  my question is about intraday and daytoday volatility in the funds rate  i
would think that as long as we hit the target on average that kind of volatility wouldnt have any
significant macroeconomic consequences  so why would we care
mr hilton  thats our impression that it doesnt have macro consequences  maybe its
a tempest in a teapot but for the participants in that market the uncertainty and the costs that are
borne by borrowers and lenders are an important issue  but the macro fallout the effect on longer
term rates doesnt seem to be significant
mr dudley  what we dont know is whether that volatility somehow has consequences
for term funding  how do you know the linkage between the two because theyre happening sort of
simultaneously  but i agree with spence that we dont think theres any significant macro effect
there may be some marginal effect of volatility creating a greater risk premium in the market but
its hard to say
chairman bernanke  there is an effect on swaps like foreign exchange swaps
right
mr hilton  well for a lot of what we seem to getlike the eurodollar rates and
libor and foreign exchange swaps and the way they relate to what goes on in our overnight funds
marketthe typical intraday pattern is firm in the morning and coming off late in the day  those
higher morning rates are the ones that are linked to the other rateseurodollars swapsand so its
not the average rate over time that seems to get priced into these other vehicles
mr dudley  the high morning rate could conceivably affect other rates in a way
thats
mr stern  it sounds like an obvious arbitrage opportunity
mr dudley  well were not seeing much arbitrage
mr hilton  we are finding a great reluctance to do intraday arbitrage  were hearing
this from the banks that in the past would do that from time to time  coming back to one of the
other questions that don had about what we are hearing about stigma from some of the banks one
of our better contacts citibank as jim mentioned used to do a lot of arbitraging and using the
discount window the primary credit facility  on occasion after they borrowed to relend in the
market at a higher rate last year or so ago they would call us in the morning to let us know how it
was that they were helping us out with the funds rate  that has pretty much stopped cold and they
have decided on sort of classic stigma  they routinely point to the publication of borrowing data in
the h41 release and they are just not interested in the small gain from that kind of activity while
taking the risk in the market of being seen as in dire need of liquidity
mr dudley  the taf auction results underscored the idea of stigma at the primary
credit facility  its possible that we have actually a bit more stigma now than we did before because
you can just see very clearly that there would have to be stigma for people to be bidding that much
in the taf auction
chairman bernanke  president evans had a twohander
mr evans  my primary comment in all of this is related to what president stern i think
said  the way the objectives are worded here is enhanced monetary policy implementation and
the memo is worded more like how do we get our federal funds rate target effectively or
something like that  but there is really no discussion that i could find about the transmission of our
policy actions to the economy and to inflation  under our current regime we think quite
confidently that the shortterm federal funds rate prices shortterm riskfree assets along the yield
curve all the way up to the treasuries and then corporates are priced off all of that  i associate that
with marvin goodfriend who taught me that quite some time ago  its not money its not liquidity
its not the reserves per se  it would be nice if for each alternative there were some discussion that
we are preserving our understanding of the policy transmission mechanism or that we are enhancing
it or whatever  president lacker mentioned the bank of englandmaybe we could set the policy
rate as they do  the question is what will the markets do in terms of actively arbitraging
something that helps price these securities  this may not be an issue for many of these systems but
until theres some kind of analysis im not so sure  its not just averaging over the maintenance
period and i think that analysis would be useful
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  governor kohn shamelessly stole my question  laughter
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner do you have a question
mr kroszner  yes  in a lot of the discussion you just take as given the stigma
associated with the primary credit facility and you were just discussing that related to the
publication of information about the facility  is that something that could also be on the table  that
seems to be potentially an instrument for which we might have to consider how much information
to provide or about making it less or more attractive which then would affect which options are
more or less attractive  is there some reason not to do that
mr madigan  i think thats worth some further thought governor kroszner  one issue
though as im sure you know is that the board is required by law to publish weekly information on
the individual banks balance sheets as well as the consolidated balance sheet with a certain amount
of detail  i dont remember the exact legal wording but at least within the current law to back
away from that might be difficult  of course you could conceivably pursue a change in the law but
i think we would want to think about the pros and cons of that before you went in that direction
mr kroszner  for sure but just thinking about whether there are other things that we
could do related to stigma might be worthwhile in this context
mr madigan  absolutely we agree  of course when the board adopted the primary
credit program in 2003 we gave a lot of thought before that and did considerable work after that to
try to minimize the amount of stigma by trying to make very clear to banks that in our view use of
the window didnt entail stigma  but the fundamental problem still is that banks are concerned that
their use of the window may be detected in the market one way or another especially in a period of
financial stress and that is just not a cost worth incurring
chairman bernanke  president plosser did you have a question
mr plosser  yes just an implementation question  one thing you talked about was in
periods of stress the way weve conducted policy intraday you have had firmness in the funds rate
in the morning and then weakness in the afternoon causing some intraday volatility  the difficulty
of hitting the target was partly the fact that we were entering the market only once a day in the
morning and you had to see through that  with all these other strategies as they are implemented
in other countries are the central banks doing the same thing  are they entering the market only
once a day or do they come in several times a day  i just wondered if there are differences in their
approaches as to how often they interact in the marketplace
mr hilton  i would say as a general characterization that the common practice is to
intervene only once a day in the morningnot unlike what we do  where theres an exception its
like with the bank of canada  they have access to information that would allow them to know with
precision late in the day what the supply of reserves is in the absence of any further open market
operations and then they make an adjustment accordingly
the fact is that even if we were to operate late in the day but still before the closelets
say 530 or 600we really have no more information than we had at 930 in the morning upon
which to make an estimate of that days reserve supply  we can observe rates but we dont know
what amount of a reserve adjustment would be needed to bring supply in line with demand  the
risk of just opening up and offering to be one side or the other of the market in that situation late in
the day is that we could get the entirety of one side of the market and actually create a reserve
imbalance in the other direction between that time and the close of the day  so simply being willing
to operate late in the day isnt really enough  you do need reserve information as well upon which
to size those operations
vice chairman geithner  just to make this clear spence is it the number of banks
that make that information more accessible in canada or is it something else  is it fundamentally
that they have just five banks
mr hilton  no it is that they know the balance sheet  they know it by late in the day
with certainty  they have few sources of uncertainty to begin with and their major source of
uncertainty government balances is something that perhaps the small number of banks theyre
dealing with facilitates  but it is that they know by late in the day what the supply of reserves will
be with real precision
mr meyer  basically everything clears through their equivalent of fedwire so they
know in real time what the balances are
chairman bernanke  okay  did you have a question
mr lacker  a comment about stigma  every financial transaction that a substantive
firm engages in that becomes known is relied upon by market participants to make inferences
theres a huge literature on the effect on equity values of the announcement of a bank line of credit
and like through this last crisis if you talk to fundingdesk guys theyre very aware at the tactical
level about what counterparties are revealing by their actions in funding markets  they take that on
board and theyre very strategic about what they reveal with their market transactions  we can try
to keep it secret but theres a broad ability in the market to infer when somebody goes to the
window by their behavior before that  im saying that i dont think we should get our hopes up
about ever eliminating stigma
chairman bernanke  okay  lets take positions and comments keeping in mind
that lunch is being held hostage  laughter  president rosengren
mr rosengren  okay  just a quick question which doesnt have to be answered
nowgiven all of the financial turmoil it would be interesting to see whether in other countries
that have these different arrangements there was a decrease in either overnight or term lending
with counterparties  given the extent to which you can just work with a central bank rather than
counterparties is there any evidence in these other regimes that interbank lending transaction
volume disappeared in some of these countries  i would be interested in seeing that  regarding
governor kroszners comment on the h41 release it does seem that we could probably have a
materiality requirement in our balance sheet  under most circumstances what we are doing at
the discount window would seem not to hit that materiality criterion  i think we could be a little
more innovativei agree with president lackers pointbut i think that the h41 does seem to
have an effect and if we will be doing all these other things taking another look at the h41 and
making sure that we dont have more untapped flexibilities probably makes a lot of sense
i would like a little more discussion of promote efficient and resilient money markets
and government securities markets as a criterion  im not sure i would weight those criteria
equally  it seems that all these criteria for the most part take care of most of the dead weight
loss and given that the banks still have to administrate for daylight credit i am not sure that the
burden is all that different across these various regimes  but i can imagine that that one might be
different and given we just had financial turmoili know this is a bit different from what
president lacker saidi would put a little more attention to that
overall i like option 2 and option 5  im comfortable with those two  im attracted to
the voluntary balance program  on net i would probably prefer a longer maintenance period to
a oneday maintenance period but i dont have a strong preference and could easily be
convinced otherwise
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  as i mentioned earlier i would find some
discussion about the transmission mechanism usefulat what rate we think the markets would
be picking up the price of riskfree yield curves  i think that would help  to the extent that we
can align this with other foreign central bank experiences we might be able to draw on how they
view that and what the financial market data look like  so i am comfortable with focusing
primarily on options 2 and 5  i was thinking along the lines of president hoenig which is that
the federal reserve tends to go slowly  vince isnt here but he often reminded us of that
option 1 is the easiest one  if we have enough information about it then thats fine  i think
thats all i have
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  i have only two comments  i would drop option 1  i just think it doesnt
do enough to reduce the burdens and dead weight losses  as long as its there there will be a
tendency to fall back to it for all sorts of reasons given bureaucratic tendencies  so i would just
discard it  i would not discard option 4 so i would include options 2 4 and 5  i was originally
attracted to 4  i read the reservations in the report and thought okay its not worth pursuing
but i listened to president lacker and he reconvinced me that there are some significant merits
there
chairman bernanke  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you  first i do really appreciate all the excellent work the staff
has done on this topic  i really learned a lot from these papers  i thought they were very clear
and very comprehensive  i have just a couple of comments on the questions that bill and brian
raised in the memo  the first one has to do with whether or not we agree with the objectives
and i do have a couple of issues
first i think that the stated objective of reducing the burdens and dead weight losses
associated with the current reserve tax is too narrowly framed in the paper  my starting point is
about burden that to cover a given program of government spending the treasury has to obtain
revenue from some source and nondistortionary lumpsum taxes are not one of the available
options  so the real question from the public finance standpoint is what to tax and how much
that means to my mind that the issue here is how the magnitude of the welfare gains that would
come from lowering the dead weight loss due to the implicit tax on reserves compares with
additional dead weight losses that would result from the alternative taxes that would have to be
raised to make up for this lost revenue  now the answer depends in part on the interest elasticity
of demand for reserves i believe  i think it is the case that if the interest elasticity is relatively
small the dead weight loss from the reserve tax is relatively small and the net welfare gain
taking into account the burdens of raising other taxes to make up for the lost seigniorage in
effect could easily turn out to be negative
let me give you an example of where this comes into play  there is a wellknown paper
by martin feldstein in which he looks at the benefits of moving to price stability zero inflation
which he favors  he looks at this issue in that context and he concludes that there would be net
social losses not gains from the reduction in seigniorage that would be associated with a move
to zero inflation from positive inflation because the dead weight loss due to the shoeleather cost
also known as the bailey effect is smaller than the dead weight losses that would be associated
with alternative taxes  in his analysis they are taxes on labor supply and saving  i actually think
that this is a serious problem with the framing of the objectives in this paper  it is in effect
saying we think we should give a tax cut  we think we should give it to banks and we think
that because there is a welfare lossa harberger triangleassociated with that this is clear
welfare gain  now i am not pretending to know exactly how this would come out but i do
think thats the issue  if it were to come out that this is a net loss not a gain a possible
implication is that if there were a fallback to option 1im not saying that i favor option 1
there could be a case for paying no interest on required reserves rather than paying interest at the
federal funds rate but paying interest on excess reserves at some rate that we would determine
there are administrative costs with having voluntary target balances and it seems to me
that the paper as we come out with it ought to try to at least estimate what the administrative
burdens associated with options 2 and 5 would be
another comment on the issue of objectives  if we are coming out with a white paper it
seems to me that the objective that everybody is now discussing and that was just discussed
namely that paying interest on reserves would enable us to expand the size of our balance sheet
in times of financial crisis like now and perhaps greatly enhance the scope for liquidityaltering
interventions that would be possible without having to push the federal funds rate to zerois a
real improvement in the tool kit that is available to us to address market disruptions  i would see
it as an advantage of paying interest on reserves  if you are discussing this right now with the
congress and it is much discussed in the press i think it is kind of odd to come out with a paper
that doesnt even mention it  maybe there are disadvantages and not just advantages  but it
seems to me it should be there
also i would just say on the question of options 2 and 5 versus options 3 and 4 an
advantage that the paper attaches to having voluntary targets is the ability to moderate the
volatility in the federal funds rate  so it does seem to me thati understand it may be
difficultthe possibility of intervening multiple times during the day as an alternative if it were
possible to change the procedures so that there could be multiple interventions to reduce
volatility would mean that 3 and 4 could be on the table and there might be less burden
associated with those  so i think that possibility deserves at least careful consideration
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  this is a proposal for study  the timeline
seems fine to me  the study period is pretty important in this case because it is not clear to me
which option is best and so i think maybe we should keep more of the options on the table  one
question that i have is to what extent are current reserve requirements actually binding for
depository institutions  there is a past study by the st louis staffdick anderson and bob
raschesuggesting that by and large existing reserve requirements are not binding  to me
that calls into question whether objective 1 for this study group is really appropriate  dead
weight losses make sense to me only if there is a binding reserve requirement  in that regard id
like to endorse president yellens comment which i thought was right on target about whether
you are going to make up for lost revenue from somewhere else and how distortionary that
would be  there is a bit of political risk here that if this starts to get painted as a handout to
banks maybe it wouldnt serve us well
i would like to see more emphasis on option 3 which based on the discussion seems to be
not too bad a system  that is the canadian system  that is a tested system in an economy that is
not too different from our owncertainly an economy that is closely integrated with this one
the corridor would be narrow  there might be more volatility within that corridor but you still
seem to get pretty good results  i know they have a small number of banks but it seems to me
with todays technology you might be able to get a good read even for a large economy  i would
like to see it kept in the mix here  they have had lots of success and very low administrative
burden if that is what you are worried about  i am perhaps not so familiar with options 2 and 5
which are the favored options in this discussion  but i am concerned about the language of
voluntary balance targets which seem to be maybe not that voluntary  it seems to me to create a
risk that the systems are really not as marketoriented as i would like to see or that they could be
manipulated by market participants particularly in a time of stress  those are some of the
concerns i had about this
chairman bernanke  on the public finance question of course the congress has
acted and they score it to cost  so in some sense that is moot from our perspective  president
pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  let me also start by commending the
authors of the papers that were prepared on this topic  i found the material very informative and
helpful  i agree with the objectives established by the staff to evaluate the set of proposals and i
also support the process and the proposed timeline for moving the proposals forward  i think it is
good that the timeline provides for comments from banks so early in the process  it will be
important for us to receive their input at an early stage
i found option 2 to be preferable to option 1 because option 2 as we have discussed
clearly reduces the administrative burdens relative to option 1  i think that option 3 leaves too
much potential for fed funds rate volatility in its corridor  i was also intrigued by option 4 with
caps  however i ultimately rejected option 4 out of the concern that it might lead to a less
robust interbank lending market  but given the comments of president lacker and others
perhaps it makes sense to keep option 4 on the table  in the end however i am comfortable with
moving forward with our focus on options 2 and 5  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  just to answer the questions that were
posed i am comfortable with options 2 and 5 but i thought president lackers presentation
made the case that option 4 deserves to remain in the mix  i think the objectives are appropriate
the only comment i haveand this is a bit vague i realizeis to ensure that we are thinking far
enough ahead to ensure that we have a durable system that can operate in different mixes of
private and public in the payment system  certainly i think it is conceivable that in some years
we will be out of the business of retail payments so i think we have to address different mixes of
private and public payment systems
regarding the timeline governor kohn already asked the question about approaching the
congress to accelerate  assuming that we do not approach the congress to accelerate this then
this timeline seems to me quite comfortable and gives plenty of time for very careful
consideration
in the room here is will roberds from our research staff who by chance was at the bank
of england talking about their experiences recently  i thought i would share a couple of things
that are apropos  they tried maintenance periods other than the intermeeting period and they
found them to be not so effective apparently because of ambiguity around the target rate  that
is a useful way of thinkingthat the maintenance periods would be designed around the
intermeeting period  they apparently tried option 3 and it didnt work because of too much
volatility within the corridor  those two tidbits are feedback from the visit of a member of my
staff to the bank of england  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i would look at this meeting as an
introduction to this topic given the breadth of the discussion here which i found extremely
interesting and useful  i think we will need to come back to another discussion of itnot
necessarily with another 100page study  i wouldnt want to put that burden on youit might
negate any savings we get from this project  laughter
to the point of the options the one that was most attractive to me was option 2  it is a
good transition  we have some familiarity with it given the way we do clearing balances now
and i think we can work on it  the reason that i was a little questioning about option 1 is that in
option 2 you are not quite sure what you are going to end up with given how the banks may
choose to target the amount of reserves and so forth  but with any choice we make we are going
to have to go up that learning curve  so of those i prefer option 2  i am fascinated though with
president lackers comments on option 4 and will look at it again with that in mind because i
thought he made some good points  but at the moment i think option 2 is a pretty good path to
go down
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  this will be very brief  option 2 looks very
attractive to me  i think option 1 may be a fallback position but like president stern given our
tendency to move slow too quickly if that makes sense i would rather take the opportunity to
make a larger step  so i think option 2 is fine  option 5 is interesting but its distinction is that
nobody else is really doing that  so it would be a little more of a wild card in terms of how we
might implement it and how it might work  but i think it has some merit
i had asked bill dudley back in the fall when we were having trouble meeting the end
ofday targets about why we didnt set the price  the answer i got was well this was a good
time to think about that option in the context of paying interest on reserves  i was probably a
little disappointed that we didnt see more of what such a strategy might look like and how it
would behave  thanks to president lacker his interpretation of option 4 is pushing us more in
that direction  i hadnt really thought of option 4 in that context that way but i like it  i still
have the view that essentially looking at everything as a quantitybased view of how we go about
doing this restricts the way we think about what our options might be  so i would like to see a
little more explanation of what a price target where we buy and sell might actually do  how
that might interact with option 4 would be an interesting way to enrich the set of options
another question i hadand i dont know the answer to thisis that we have instituted a
number of new facilities  there is the taf there is the tslf and so forth  i wasnt quite clear
how those facilities would interact or be appropriate or inappropriate within the context of these
things or whether this would substitute for all of those in some sense  if we wanted to pull those
off the shelf again at some future time how would they interact with these systems  i think it
would be useful to have a little discussion about what those interactions might be
the last observation is related to president lockharts comment  how we go about
paying interest on reserves has implications for other parts of what the federal reserve system
doesin particular the retail payment system and the way we calculate cost recoveries and our
revenues under the monetary control act  there are some separate study groups that are
thinking about this but we ought to make sure that we tie these pieces together as we go forward
so that we know what the domino effects of going this direction might be  maybe there will not
be a concern if we get out of retail payments how it affects the monetary control act
requirements on fees for services and things like that  i would like to see that loop closed
somehow before the end of the discussion  otherwise i want to congratulate the staff on a very
thorough report  i was at the conference as well in february  i thought it was very interesting
and i applaud the staff on some good work  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman we have been in favor of paying interest on reserves for
some time  this is an excellent paper  like everybody else i learned a great deal from all the
papers that were sent and this superb summary that was just presented  i personally tend toward
option 2 but i think it is worthwhile considering options 4 and 5 as well in terms of vetting this
under the timetable  i think that charlie asked a good question about how this relates to the other
facilities but generally the optics on this are favorable  again we are moving forward  the
public doesnt really understand the background of thiswhere the congress has stood and what
we have achieved so far  i think it would be just one other good thing for us to be modernizing
the federal reserve
i asked the question on governance just because i understand that the current plan calls
for rates to adjust automatically to changes in target set by the fomc  i would want to make
sure that was the case  in other words i dont like the potential for vesting all the power in the
board and of course that potential is there  i think it is worth preserving the federal system of
the federal reserve  that is the only reservation i have  those are my comments  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  we dont want it  laughter  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i thought this was a great piece of work by the
staff and i thank them all  you did a good job of organizing it and laying out the general
principles in a way that people can understand  despite president yellens comments i have no
regrets about my testimony in favor of paying interest perhaps because i bore so much of the
administrative costs over the years laughteralong with stephanie martin and her
predecessors in the legal division  those costs that were borne were considerable in addition
to the dead weight losses
i think we should consider options 2 and 5 for sure  on option 4 i think we need to
understand a bitother people have said thiswhat the third objective promoting efficient and
resilient money markets means exactly what is entailed and how that would intersect with
option 4  so i think that needs to be fleshed out a little more  because you have planned to get a
white paper out soon i think perhaps including option 4 would be easier than not including it
just to get peoples comments  perhaps because of my administrative burden experience i
would like to see reserve requirements at zero ruling out option 1  on option 3 i just dont
think at least with our system and in periods of crisis that the top of the band would hold so i
dont think that option would really work very well  thank you all for your work
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me add my plaudits to those already
expressed on the quality of this work and then let me confine my comments to the timing and
sequencing  first with respect to the rollout of the white paper it strikes me that given that
questions have been raised about what our flexibility is around our balance sheet and tools in the
event of continued problems in the financial markets we just need to be cognizant in that paper
of how this discussion might be read not in the context of a long fed effort to get interest on
reserves but perhaps as being solely responsive to what are perceived to be burdens on our
balance sheet flexibility  i am just sensitive to how that white paper will be read and rolled out
more broadly on timingcome fall in the event that we decide collectively to go to the
congress seeking other authority with respect to the pdcf investment banks and other things
that might or might not be concluded even though this timeline makes a lot of sense we might
be in good stead to have a fairly good sense of the conclusions to which we will ultimately come
even if our exhaustive fed rigor isnt complete by that time  if there is real benefit to
accelerating our new authority from late 2011 to some earlier period we could put that in the
context of some of broader asks from us with an expectation that we might get some traction
there  so as a sort of secondary timeline having that option value come fall strikes me as useful
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks  great work great presentation  it is impressive to get
through fiftytwo pages in less than fiftytwo minutes and so i applaud you on that  basically i
agree with a lot of the stuff that has been said before  the trick may be thinking a bit creatively
about stigma issues if there is any way to deal with those  i am not quite sure what you are
suggesting putting out in a white paper for commentoptions 2 5 and possibly 4  or were you
thinking of putting all five out
mr madigan  well i certainly think at this point the three that you mentioned first
at this stage if we are going to go to with three we might want to think about putting all five
out just to flesh out all parts of the spectrum and acknowledge that option 1 could be a fallback
we have to think about the pros and cons of that but certainly the three at this point is where the
consensus seems to be
mr kroszner  doing three of them seems perfectly reasonable  thank you
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  i am very comfortable with the analysis and the approach so i dont
have any major comments there  although in the white paper you might mention them i would
like to take options 1 and 3 off the table  option 1 has just too much administrative burden  we
have enough tsuris already  although option 3 may work well in countries with very different
structures of the banking system i dont think it is a feasible alternative for us  so i think that
we should look at options 2 and 5 and i am certainly comfortable with another look at option 4
one issue that i worry about a bit is that these markets do sort out some interbank credit
risk issues  we dont want to lose that so we have to be very aware of it  i also worry a bit
about setting a price when there is a credit risk element to it  when there is no credit risk
elementif you want to set the treasury bill rateit is no big deal  but there may be an issue
there i am not sure and it should be one of the considerations in this context  thank you
chairman bernanke  vice chairman  oh sorry  president lacker
mr lacker  presumably the rate we pay would be viewed as a riskfree rate
presumably any market rate would be priced relative to that to include a credit premium in the
usual way  if any other dynamics are anticipated by the staff it would be useful to know that
but the usual presumption we have is that observed market rates would have our rate plus a
credit premium booked into it or transaction costs or whatever  id just make that comment
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i dont have a conviction
yet on the options but i agree that we should narrow our focus to options 2 and 45  i think we
should design a process that tries to force us to get conviction more quickly on which option we
would prefer  i think it is possible  you have made a huge investment already  you know the
alternatives  i think it is worth again a goal that gets us conviction more quickly in part
because we do have a brief window now in which we might be able to get the congress to
accelerate and we could implement more quickly  i would get the congress to accelerate if i
could be totally confident that it would be free that we would pay no price and that there would
be no risk that anything else would be on the table or that it would compromise any other
objective  it is very hard to have confidence on that  but if you get confidence on that then i
would go do it  but i would certainly run a process by which we get conviction early
i would want us to have conviction before we go out for public comment  the general
rule is to figure out what you want to do and design a process that maximizes the chance that you
get there quickly  it also strikes me that a process this drawn out will take much more staff time
you guys are busy  we dont have a lot of time  we dont have a lot of excess capital in the
federal reserve system now relative to the challenges we face  the longer it is drawn out
maybe the smaller the tax day by day week by week but it is just a huge tax  i would not want
to go out for public comment on a white paper in this time frame until i knew two things  one
is are we going to get the congress to accelerate  if so on what  what is the probability  are
we going to ask for it  the other is i wouldnt do it until i knew that we were closer to saying
if we got it we would do this in this time frame
finally i think it is hard to have this discussion in public with the congress now without
an answer to what they will perceive to be the larger questions  what are the larger questions  i
think that you can reduce some of the larger questions simply to what are we going to do with
our role as lender of last resort going forward  this is a version of president plossers and
governor warshs questionswhat the future of our facilities is in some sense  the staff has
assured me that these options all preserve optionality on any future facility framework  they
dont prejudice those options which is very important  but i think there is a demand now and
interest in what our answer is to those broader questions  it is hard to see the architecture of our
role as lender of last resort without having the answer to what the framework will be for
restraints on risktaking by institutions that have access in normal times and in extremis to those
lender of last resort facilities
we cant get conviction on that in the same time frame that we need to accelerate
legislation on this stuff butand probably becausei think those things are fundamentally
more important than whether we end up with 2 or 45 or 5 on the way to 45  i would try to
shorten the amount of time and effort we put into this and i would increase the amount of time
and effort we put into that broader set of policy questions which are going to be essentially
about the intersection among the lender of last resort role our monetary policy regime the moral
hazard consequences of all the stuff we have done and how we deal with those in the future  i
think that is going to take a lot of time effort and care
i dont know how to reconcile all of what i just said in the context of a practical path
forward except just to repeat it  why not try to run a process in which you get conviction more
quickly on this relatively small set of adjustments as to how we operate  try to get a judgment
quickly about whether we can get the congress to accelerate without any meaningful political
cost then design a process whereby we put ourselves in the position to implement early next
year if the congress were to accelerate  and try to have the resources saved by attenuating that
process devoted to these deeper questions about our future facilities and the associated
constraints we are going to have to put on a broader set of institutions
chairman bernanke  thank you  on those broader questions vice chairman
we are going to talk at lunch about some initiatives by which we will address some of the
broader regulatory and bank supervision issues  that process will be parallel to this  what i
would say about this issue is that as you go forward you should keep in mind the possibility we
might want to go to the congress for some kind of interim power  obviously there are things
that we can do that are not the full panoply of things you described today  they would be
interim steps and i think that the most important thing is to make sure that whatever we ask for
would not be inconsistent with or contradictory to some of the longerterm plans  we obviously
dont anticipate implementing option 5 next year but we could take some interim steps that
potentially might be useful in the current circumstances
very briefly i agree with president fisher and president lacker  this is a onceina
generation chance to modernize our system  it is a relic that we use a quantitybased
management of the federal funds rate  so i think option 1 should be a fallback if we cant make
something else work but we should try very hard to see if we can find a system that will let us
manage the funds rate tightly even as our balance sheet expands and contracts and so on  i have
the same concerns about option 3 that it might not tie down the fed funds rate very much
options 2 and 5 are interesting  i agree with president lacker that option 4 is worth exploring  i
broached this with the staff before the meeting  option 4 seems a lot like friedmans optimum
quantity of money  you just throw out money until the transaction cost on margin is zero
thats basically what it is  i dont frankly fully understand what the implications would be for
the federal funds marketwhether the federal funds market is just a shoeleather cost or whether
it actually has some useful functions including price discovery credit risk management and
counterparty discipline  there may be some functions of that market that are important and
even if it still existed if its liquidity were greatly reduced so that it wasnt functioning in a
normal way it could be a question  to my mind that is the main question we have to understand
as we think about option 4  once again terrific work and this is really exciting interesting stuff
so thank you all very much  are there any other comments on interest on reserves
okay  if not lets see  first again the projections are due thursday at 500 pm  if
anyone has changes please make the effort to do that  we will be circulating information on the
2009 fomc schedule to try to come to closure on that  the next meeting is tuesday and
wednesday june 24 and 25  in a moment we will adjourn and get lunch but please come back
to the table so that we can have some discussion about some of our longerterm issues on
supervision and regulation  thank you very much  the meeting is adjourned
end of meeting
