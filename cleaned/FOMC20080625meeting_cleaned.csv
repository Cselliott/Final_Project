transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of june 2425 2008
june 24 2008afternoon session
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  why dont we begin as usual
with the desk report and bill dudley  bill
mr dudley1  thank you mr chairman  im going to be referring to the handout that you should have in front of you  financial markets have become more resilient to bad news in recent weeks  although the news associated with several important groups of financial intermediariesincluding investment banks commercial banks and the monoline insurershas not been favorable contagion has been limited compared with some of our earlier experiences during the past year
moreover the types of vicious feedback loops that were evident for example in early march have been largely absent more recently
despite this much of the news has not been good  looking first at the us equity and credit markets a good portion of the improvement that occurred in the runup to the april fomc meeting has been unwound recently  the broad us equity indexes are only marginally above their low points reached in midmarch and the price of the standard  poors 500 financial subindex has fallen to a new trough exhibit 1  in contrast corporate credit spreads have held on to much of the gains achieved after midmarch  as shown in exhibit 2 the spreads on both investment grade and highyield corporate debt have been quite stable recently  however as shown in exhibit 3 corporate credit default swap spreads have widened over the past few weeks
most of the major investment banks have continued to struggle  as shown in exhibit 4 the share prices of the four remaining independent us investment banks remain depressed  further writeoffs capitalraising which is increasing the number of common share equivalents outstanding and investors concerns about the consequences of deleveraging on longterm profitability have all been important factors weighing on share prices  in contrast to this poor equityprice performance credit default swap cds spreads remain much narrower than at the time of bear stearnss demise in midmarch exhibit 5  the establishment of the primary dealer credit facility and the federal reserves role in the acquisition of bear stearns by jpmorgan chase are undoubtedly both important factors behind the divergence of equity prices and credit default swap spreads  lehman brothers which reported a secondquarter loss that was considerably larger than expected has been under the most stress  however in contrast to bear stearnss experience in midmarch lehmans shortterm financing counterparties have generally proved to be patient
the financing backstop provided by the primary dealer credit facility has been cited by many counterparties as a critical element that has encouraged them to keep their

1  the materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1
financing lines to lehman in place  the investment banks have begun to rapidly deleverage their balance sheets  as shown in exhibit 6 the gross leverage ratios for lehman brothers goldman sachs and morgan stanley all fell sharply in the second quarter  this stands in marked contrast to the rise in leverage ratios that persisted through the first quarter of this year
regional banks have also come under considerable strain recently  deterioration in their construction lending commercial real estate and residential mortgage books has caused many banks to raise their loanloss provisions sharply  potential acquirers of troubled regional banks have been discouraged by the accounting requirement that these banks must mark down the assets of the bank that theyre acquiring to the current market value at the time of the acquisition
the financial guarantors have also been under stress  both standard  poors and moodys recently downgraded ambac and mbia  the moodys downgrade of mbia was particularly sharpfive notches to a2 from aaa  these downgrades of the monoline guarantors have a number of important implications  first the firms that have purchased protection from ambac and mbia will have to take significant writedowns  citigroup merrill lynch and ubs appear to have the largest  exposures to these two firms  second the ability of ambac and mbia to establish new aaarated subsidiaries that would enable them to write new municipal bond insurance is increasingly in doubt  most likely these firms will be forced to go into runoff mode in which they can no longer write new business  third the financial resources of these firms will be strained by the downgrades  for example mbia said that as a result of the downgrades it may have to pay out 29 billion to satisfy certain contracts and post up to 45 billion of additional collateral  fourth the risk of a default or a restructuring event by a major monoline guarantor could potentially unsettle the cds market  as shown in exhibits 7 and 8 the share prices of the monolines have continued to slide and their credit default swap spreads have risen further  as has been the case for some time there remainseven after the credit rating downgradesa big disconnect between the cds spreads of these firms and their credit ratings
despite these rating downgrades the effect on the municipal securities market has been muted compared with the turmoil evident in the first quarter  put simply much of the adjustment in the shortterm municipal marketfor example the demise of the muni auction rate securities market and the restructuring of many variable rate demand notes vrdn and tender option bond tob securities has already taken place  although the yields on the vrdns wrapped by ambac and mbia have increased sharply up to now much of this paper has been remarketed rather than put back to the liquidity providers  the effect on the municipal bond market has been even more subdued  as shown in exhibit 9 the ratios of 10year and 30year municipal yields to comparable treasury yields have risen only slightly recently and remain well below the peaks reached in midmarch  investors have already been looking through the credit ratings of the monoline insurers to the quality of the underlying taxexempt issuer
the performance of term funding markets also suggests a greater resilience to bad news  subsequent to the may expansion of the taf auction sizes and the increase in the foreign exchange swap lines with the european central bank and the swiss national bank onemonth and threemonth liborois spreads have narrowed significantly exhibits 10 and 11  the decline in term funding spreads is particularly noteworthy because it stands in contrast to the widening that occurred in the last month of the three preceding quartersseptember december and march  the increase in the size of the taf auctions has also been associated with a decline in
bidtocover ratios also as shown in exhibit 12 the spread between the stopout rate and the minimum bid rate has been relatively low  in contrast to the us auctions the bidtocover ratios in the ecb and snb auctions have risen sharply over the last three auctions exhibit 13  this likely reflects several factors including 1 a reduction in the willingness of us banks to lend at term to european banksdue mostly to balance sheet constraints and 2 strategic bidding behavior  as you recall the ecb auction is a noncompetitive auction with the stopout rate determined by the taf auction  as a consequence increasing the bid size in the ecb auction will not raise the price that the banks will have to pay and that encourages more bidding in the ecb auctions  this strategic bidding explanation however is undercut by the fact that european banks have also been strong bidders in both the taf and the snb auctions  the introduction by icap of a competing measure of bank funding costs the new york funding rate nyfrhas mostly bolstered the credibility of libor  the nyfr rates have consistently been within 1 or 2 basis points of libor  however it is unclear how much this conformity reflects the accuracy of libor  it is possible that the nyfr respondents use libor as a benchmark for their own responses since libor comes out earlier in the day than when they have to respond
demand for the term securities lending facility tslf auctions has also generally been subdued  only one of the last nine auctions has been fully subscribed  this mainly reflects the convergence in treasury and nontreasury repo financing rates
following the first tslf auction treasury repo rates rose sharply  given the minimum bid rates for the schedule 1 and schedule 2 auctions of 10 and 25 basis points respectively the convergence in repo rates has eroded the economic appeal of the tslf auctions as a funding vehicle  the 80 billion of the singletranche repo program has been more attractive as a source of funding  moreover the pdcf backstop has made investors more willing to finance the nontreasury collateral held by the investment banks and other primary dealers and this has also reduced the demand for tslf borrowing
the continued rise in commodity prices has been another important market development  as shown in exhibit 14 both energy and agricultural prices have been rising sharply  although the weakness of the dollar has often been cited by analysts as a causal factor behind the surge in commodity prices the recent rise in energy and food prices has been accompanied by a slightly stronger rather than weaker dollar exhibit 15  nevertheless shortterm movements in the dollar and oil prices do
appear to have become more closely linked over the past few years  exhibit 16 plots the sixmonth rolling correlation between the weekly change in the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil and the weekly change in the value of the trade weighted dollar  as can be seen these price changes have become increasingly negatively correlated in recent years  of course correlation does not imply causality even if there is causality it is unclear in what direction the causality runsfrom commodities to the dollar or from the dollar to commodities  although many factors are undoubtedly at play a couple of possible explanations that have made the rounds may be worth considering  first higher oil prices swell the dollar reserves held by the oilproducing countries  because these countries may respond to this dollar influx by selling dollars to diversify their foreign exchange reserve holdings traders may sell dollars in anticipation  second trade data suggest that the composition of import demand from the oilexporting nations is skewed away from the united states and this may also weigh on the dollar
the rise in commodity prices has fanned anxieties about inflation  as shown in exhibit 17 the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey measures of one year and fivetotenyear inflation expectations have increased recently  in contrast both barclays and the boards fiveyear fiveyearforward measures of breakeven inflation have moderated a bit since the last meeting  these measures remain well inside the ranges evident over the past year exhibit 18  the anxiety about higher commodity prices and inflation has been an important factor behind the sharp shift in monetary policy expectations  as shown in exhibits 19 and 20 the federal funds rate and eurodollar futures curves have continued to shift upward since the april fomc meeting  as shown in exhibits 21 and 22 our survey of primary dealer expectations also shows an upward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate target
however compared with the expectations embodied in futures prices the rise has been more modest  as a result the gap between the average of the dealers forecasts and the markets forecast has continued to increase and is now unusually wide  the divergence between the dealers forecasts and market expectations and the wide range of the dealers forecasts one year ahead indicate that there is considerable uncertainty about the future path of shortterm rates  this uncertainty is also evident in the fact that the implied volatility of shortterm interest rates is unusually high currently
the tightening expected over the next year is not anticipated to begin soon  as shown in exhibits 23 and 24 options on federal funds rate futures contracts currently imply that market participants expect that the fomc will stand pat at both this and the august fomc meetings  although considerable tightening is priced in over the next year this is not unusual at this stage of the monetary policy cycle  assuming that we are at the trough of the current rate cycle the magnitude of tightening expected over the next year is not significantly greater than what has been priced in following other troughs in the federal funds rate target  tomorrow we will be eight weeks beyond what may turn out to be the onset of the trough in the target rate  as shown in exhibit 25 the roughly 125 basis points of tightening that is currently priced in over the next year is comparable to what was anticipated at the same point after the federal funds rate trough in 1992
finally a few words about the primary dealer credit facility  art angulo will talk about this in more detail tomorrow  we have been actively managing our counterparty risk in this facility and have made it clear to market participants that this should be viewed as a backstop facility rather than as a core source of funding  by the end of next week borrowing from this facility is likely to drop sharply because of two events  the first is this weeks closing of the bear stearnsjpmorgan chase transaction which will result in the elimination of bear stearnss pdcf borrowing the second is the anticipated closing next week of the bank of america acquisition of countrywide which is expected to eliminate countrywides pdcf borrowing  in the absence of new financial shocks that could provoke renewed funding difficulties we would anticipate little persistent pdcf borrowing after these mergers are completed
last week i sent you a memo informing you of our plans to initiate a euro time deposit with the netherlands central bank subject to regulation n approval by the board  there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the april fomc meeting  as always i am very happy to take any questions
chairman bernanke  thank you bill  the quarterend premium seems less this
time but am i correct that the dollar premium is higher than the euro and pound premiums
mr dudley  it is a bit higher yes
chairman bernanke  is there anything to be inferred from that
mr dudley  about 225 basis points are priced in for our dollar turnmaybe 150
basis points or 175 basis points elsewherebut those are pretty small differences measured over
just a couple of days  so i wouldnt read too much into it  the reality is that the european banks
are structurally short of dollar funding and so that may be why there is a little more upward
pressure on dollar rates over the quarterend
chairman bernanke  other questions for bill  president lacker
mr lacker  yes  i notice that in chart 18 in your tipsimplied average inflationary
plot to the tenyear horizon you omit the markets groups estimate  is that because of
skepticism on your part that leads you to judge it as inferior or an overabundance of humility
laughter
mr dudley  the latter of course  laughter
mr lacker  it does of course show a slightly different trend right
mr dudley  it actually has increased a bit  but i have consistently shown just the
barclays and board measures over the past few months so this is not pick and choose
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  bill by inference talking about the primary dealer credit facility two of
the limited number of borrowers have been the two institutions you mentioned  have there been
many more or just one or two
mr dudley  there have been more borrowers than just them  some have done it
because they wanted to test the facility  some have done it because they viewed it as a fairly
advantageous cost of funding  you know there have been quite a few different borrowers but
those two borrowers mentioned are the ones that i would view as more persistent than desired
mr fisher  thank you for discreetly answering the question
chairman bernanke  other questions  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  just to follow up on that question i was at a
meeting in new york not too long ago and was talking with some people on wall street  they
suggested that for the primary dealers there was stigma attached to borrowing from the pdcf  i
wasnt quite sure what to make of that and i just wondered if you had any observations or
comments about whether you thought that was real or perceived or is there an interpretation i
should give to that
mr dudley  i think there is some stigma attached to the primary dealer credit
facility  it is hard to know exactly how much  one thing i thought was interesting  the first
week the facility was outstanding a number of institutions went to the primary dealer credit
facility and then announced that they were doing it as a test  now presumably you wouldnt
announce that you were doing it as a test if there were no stigma associated with the facility  but
i would judge that it is clearly less stigmatized than the primary credit facility probably
because it doesnt have the history that the primary credit facility has  the fact is that it is an
advantageous rate or was an advantageous rate several weeks ago and there were some
institutions that were borrowing from the facility just on the basis of rateso that suggests less
stigma than the discount window
mr plosser  thank you
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  yes  bill on chart 6 just a quick question on the leverage ratio  do we
know how good those data are  i mean to the best of our knowledge is that reliable stuff
mr dudley  this is just assets divided by equity so i think it is pretty good  when
the investment banks start proposing their adjusted leverage ratios then i think you have a
problemyou know apples and orangesbecause the different investment banks calculate
those kinds of adjusted leverage ratios a bit differently  usually you see two leverage ratios
one that is gross and another one that excludes the matched bookand the leverage ratio falls
pretty significantly when you exclude the matched book
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman  president stern i have just one thing
to add  for the first time with the three investment banks that reported for the quarter that ended
in may the sec allowed them to disclose their riskweighted ratio on the secs version of
basel ii  thats the ratio for which your question is more germane in some sense because it
shows a pretty significant cushion of capital against riskweighted assets  the question is how
good are those measures of riskweighted assets  this is a subject for discussion tomorrow but
part of our problem is that we have much less confidence in judging the integrity of what goes
into those measures of risknot to mention whether the risk weights are any good which is a
harder thing for the market to judge  but for the first time the market can see what their risk
weighted measures are at least on an sec basis which is pretty close to basel ii and those
ratios were if i recall correctly north of 10 tier 1 for the three that reportedsignificantly
higher than they were on march 1 by their own measures
mr stern  thanks
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not would someone move the
ratification
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  okay  lets turn now to
the economic situation  nathan ill start with you
mr sheets2  thank you mr chairman  given that developments in global commodities markets have continued to have influential effects on our forecast for domestic activity and prices we felt that it would be useful for me to lead off with the international portion of the chart show which will include a discussion of these markets  following my remarks larry and bill will present our outlook for the us economy
as shown in the top panel of your first exhibit total foreign real gdp growth line 1 stepped down from an average pace of 4 percent in the first three quarters of 2007 to around 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year  we see growth abroad as likely to decline to 22 percent in the current quarter and to pick up only slightly in the second half of the year  next year with the expected firming of us activity and diminishing headwinds from the financial turmoil foreign growth should rise back to a 3 percent pace  growth abroad was just a bit stronger in the first quarter than we had anticipated but the composition of that growth came as more of a surprise  canadian gdp line 3 posted a slight contraction reflecting a continuing downturn in exports and stagnant investment  in contrast the pace of activity in japan line 4 and the euro area line 5 was much more vigorous than we had expected including a 6 percent surge in germany
nevertheless recent data for these economies point to much weaker growth in the second quarter  as shown in the middle left panel japanese manufacturing output

2  the materials used by messrs sheets slifman and wascher are appended to this transcript appendix 2
has declined recently and labor market conditions have softened  for the euro area the middle right various indicators are showing weakness including retail sales and the purchasing managers index  as highlighted in the bottom panel growth in the emerging market economies is expected to step down over the next few quarters but should remain relatively resilient especially compared with the weak performance of these economies during the us recession earlier this decade  many of the emes were particularly vulnerable to the hightech and manufacturingled downturn that occurred at that time and fundamentals in the emes are now stronger than was then the case  in addition chinese domestic demand has remained quite robust of late and this has likely helped to support growth in emerging asia
as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2 oil prices have continued to soar with the spot price of wti closing yesterday at 136 per barrel  the fardated futures price has climbed to about the same level  our forecast for the path of oil prices is now roughly 50 a barrel higher than at the time of the january chart show  divining the causes of this staggering rise in oil prices is no doubt ground on which angels fear to tread but we continue to assert bravely that the primary driver of higher oil prices is constrained and price inelastic oil supply coupled with relatively strong and price inelastic oil demand  these deep features of the oil marketalong with stressed geopolitical conditions in many oilproducing countries rising production costs and concern about the reliability of medium to longrun supplyhave sent oil prices spiraling upward
as shown in the last column of the middle table the increase in oil prices appears to have contributed to modest declines in oil consumption in the advanced economies including the united states line 3  but oil consumption has continued to move up in the emerging market economies especially in china line 5 and the middle east line 6  consumers in many emes have been shielded from rising prices by government fuel subsidies  the economic and fiscal costs of such subsidies are becoming increasingly burdensome however prompting some countries including china late last week to allow domestic fuel prices to move toward world levels  as seen on the top right oil inventories in oecd countries have declined over the past year and a half  unfortunately little information is available about the behavior of inventories outside of oecd countries
the bottom left panel shows that the rise in global oil production since 2004 has significantly lagged the expansion of world gdp weighted by oil consumption indeed production has remained relatively flat during most of that period  notably however the lack of oil production is not due to geological constraints  data on years of proved reserves shown on the bottom right are at roughly the same level as a decade ago  but those reserves are now concentrated in areas where production is constrained by acute geopolitical risks uncertainty about property rights inadequate investment and high production costs
turning to your next exhibit nonfuel commodity prices have also risen significantly on average since your last chart show with most of the increase coming
in the first few months of the year  here too we believe that the elevated level of prices is a result mainly of strong and sustained global demand lagging supply responses and rising production costs  consistent with this observation inventories of key commodities shown in the middle left panel have trended down in recent years  it bears emphasizing however that nonfuel commodity prices certainly have not moved in lockstep with each other  as seen in the bottom left panel the price of corn has surged to new highs supported by ethanol demand and more recently as adverse weather in the midwest has endangered a substantial fraction of this years crop  in contrast the price of wheat has fallen back from its recent peak as improved growing conditions in australia seem likely to boost supply  for metals the price of zinc has moved down significantly since its peak in late 2006 as new smelters have come on line  the price of copper has moved sidewaysbut at a high levelover the past two years as prospective increases in supply have not yet materialized
a number of other explanations for the recent runup in oil and other commodity prices have also been advanced including the possibility that increased purchases by speculators in commodity futures markets may be playing an important role  given the magnitude of the financial flows into these markets we are hesitant to slam the door completely on this explanation but our work finds little supporting evidence
as noted on the top right prices of a number of commodities that are not traded in futures markets have also risen substantially  second a sustained increase in demand by investors would suggest that inventories should be rising instead as i have noted inventories are now relatively tight  finally we see no evidence that the positions taken by noncommercial traders in futures markets actually predict commodity prices for example such positions for light sweet crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange have been roughly flat since mid2007  two other frequently cited explanations for the rise in commodity prices are the depreciation of the dollar and declines in interest rates  the middleright panel shows the correlation of the broad nominal dollar with oil prices and with an index of nonfuel commodity prices  both correlations are negative over most of the sample implying that depreciations of the dollar have tended to happen at the same time as rises in commodity prices  while these correlations have become more negative since mid2007 they remain within the ranges seen in recent years and interpreting the direction of causality for this relationship is difficult  also as bill noted the dollar has been relatively stable over the past several months but oil prices have continued their upward climb  similar plots of correlations of interest rates with commodity prices shown on the bottom right are quite noisy and fail to point to any clear conclusions
as shown in exhibit 4 the runup in commodity prices has continued to lift headline consumer price inflation in both the advanced foreign economies and the emerging markets  we expect that inflation abroad will remain elevated in the near term but eventually move back down as slower global growth reduces pressures on resources and as commodity prices flatten out consistent with quotes from futures markets  of course one clear risk to these projections is that commodity prices may yet again confound our expectations and continue rising  another risk is that the high rates of inflation now being recorded may become embedded in inflation
expectations  as shown in the top right panels measures of longterm inflation compensation have recently edged up in the euro area and increased more markedly in canada  in recent weeks major foreign central banks have intensified their inflationfighting rhetoric  notably the ecb has warned that it may raise rates at its next meeting and in the united kingdom mervyn kingin his letter to the chancellorunderscored his determination to ensure that inflation remains contained  as shown on the bottom left we now assume that both the ecb and the bank of england will raise rates in the second half of this year compared with the nearterm cuts we had anticipated in the april greenbook  in addition we now see the bank of canada keeping policy on hold  in the emerging market economies including mexico and china the bottom right panel increases in inflation have largely been driven by rising food prices which account for a substantial share of consumer expenditures  policymakers in the emes have taken steps to slow the rise in food prices with some countries introducing price controls and export bans on agricultural goods  but officials have also relied on moreorthodox policies to combat inflation including raising policy rates and hiking reserve requirements
indeed over the intermeeting period monetary policy was tightened in a range of emerging market economies including mexico brazil china india russia and hungary
as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 5 the path of the broad real dollar is now just a little weaker than we anticipated at the time of the january chart show  we continue to expect the dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of 3 percent through the forecast period reflecting persisting downward pressures associated with the current account deficit  this depreciation is projected to come largely against emerging market currencies including the chinese renminbi which have moved less since the dollars peak in early 2002  its safe to say that core import price inflation on the right has come in substantially higher than we projected in january  incorporating the bls monthly data for april and may we now see core import prices in the second quarter surging at an annual rate of 10 percent the fastest rise in two decades  this increase which comes on the heels of an 8 percent jump in the first quarter was heavily concentrated in materialintensive goods and suggests a much more rapid and perhaps stronger effect from the runup in commodity prices than we saw in the past  conditional on nonfuel commodity prices flattening out core import price inflation should decline to less than 2 percent next year
finally summing up what these developments mean for us activity we now see the contribution from net exports to us real gdp growth line 3 in the table as likely to exceed 2 percentage points in the second quarter as exports expand at a smart pace supported by the lower dollar and imports contract sharply  this marked weakness in imports reflects both a steep drop in real oil imports and a continued decline in imports of core goods reflecting sluggish us gdp growth and rising prices of imported commodities  the positive contribution from net exports moderates to  percentage point in the second half of this year and to  percentage point in 2009  while the pace of export growth is projected to remain strong at
above 7 percent imports should gradually accelerate as the us economy recovers larry will now continue our presentation
mr slifman  last week the washington post ran a front page story with the headline why were gloomier than the economy  like the author of the post article we too have noticed the difference between what people are saying about the economy in surveys and what they apparently are producing and spending
starting first with the survey indicators the top left panel of exhibit 6 plots the plunge in the michigan index of consumer sentiment which is far deeper than can be explained by its usual predictors such as labor market conditions inflation and the stock market  the panel to the right plots two of the most timely surveys of business attitudes which continue to suggest that the respondents are pessimistic about overall business conditions  meanwhile as shown in the middle left panel although private payrolls continue to shrink the declines have been much smaller than we were expecting and as you can see from the shaded area if you look very closely laughter much smaller than the ones that occurred during the last recession  in terms of spending data the most striking piece of news was the upward revision to earlier retail sales figures  at the time of the april greenbook real outlays for consumer goods other than motor vehicles appeared to be moving sideways the red line in the middle right panel  however the black line shows that according to the latest estimateswhich of course are still subject to additional revisionsspending rose rapidly in march and april and climbed further in may  with these numbers we revised up appreciably our nearterm estimates of the growth rate of real pce goods other than motor vehicles the inset box
on the business side the bottom left table shipments of nondefense capital  goods excluding transportation rose further in april and new orders jumped  in addition outlays for construction of nonresidential buildings the bottom line of the table continued to climb in april  all told these indicators suggest stronger business spending than we had anticipated in our april forecast  a potentially important downside development may be emerging in the motor vehicles sectorthe bottom right panelwhere according to our industry contacts sales of light vehicles appear to be plummeting in june  whether this is just a reaction to the surge in oil prices that will be contained within the auto sector or whether its a canary in the coal mine pointing to something far more serious for the entire economy remains to be seen
but it certainly has grabbed our attention and highlights a downside risk to our projection
exhibit 7 focuses on the overall gdp forecast through 2009 and some of the key factors that informed our thinking about the outlook  we had a lot of moving parts to deal with this round and the upper panel summarizes how we put them together
first in light of the incoming information we revised up our forecast for the first two quarters of this year especially the second quarter  we now think that real gdp growth came in at an annual rate of 11 percent in the first quarter and picked up to a
17 percent pace in the second quarter  as you know earlier this year we put in some
judgmental adjustments to the forecast which reflected a combination of the tendency for negative model residuals to be correlated during cyclical downturns as well as the macro effects of financial turmoil and uncertainty that are not well captured by our models  we have interpreted some of the recent spending surprise as suggesting that we went too heavy on such effects in the april greenbook and so we have tempered them in this projection  that said we still anticipate that some of these influences will show through to spending especially in the household sector and we expect the economy to be on a very subdued growth path for the next few quarters
as i will discuss shortly residential investment is still projected to be a drag on economic growth well into next year  moreover with house prices expected to fall through the end of next year the ratio of household net worth to income remains on a downward trajectory reducing some of the wherewithal for consumer spending
household purchasing power also is being held down by the surge in oil prices that nathan discussed the middle left panel  as shown in the inset box by our reckoning the increases in the spot and futures prices of wti since the april greenbook subtract about  percentage point from real gdp growth in both 2008 and 2009 with much of the effect working through pce  despite these negative influences if the story ended here the economy still would be operating with a somewhat higher utilization ratethat is a smaller gdp gapthan in the april greenbook  in light of this consideration as well as the less favorable outlook for inflation that bill will discuss we have conditioned this forecast on a tighter path for monetary policy than the one in the previous greenbook  as you can see in the middle right panel by the end of next year the federal funds rate is 100 basis points higher than in the april greenbook  i should note here that we also have raised our estimate of the growth rate of potential gdp which bill will discuss shortly
because we view our revised estimate of potential as merely the staffs catching up with what individuals and firms were already expecting these revisions result in corresponding adjustments to the growth rate of real gdp going forward
all told as illustrated in the bottom left panel after increasing substantially faster in the first half of the year real gdp is now projected to grow at an annual rate of
 percent in the second half of 2008 a bit less than in our previous projection  in 2009 real gdp is expected to increase 24 percent about  percentage point less than in the april greenbook  the bottom line of the forecast is perhaps most easily seen by the path of the gdp gap  as shown in the bottom right panel the gap starts out the projection period being much narrower than in the april forecast  by the fourth quarter of 2009 however the gap is essentially the same as in the april greenbook
after that highaltitude flyover of the projection the next two exhibits swoop down for a closer look at some of the details  exhibit 8 focuses on the housing sector with demand weak the overhang of unsold new and existing singlefamily homes the vacancy ratehas soared putting downward pressure on prices  as shown to the right the ofheo purchaseonly index of house prices fell at an annual  of 67
percent in the first quarter of 2008 and we expect home prices to continue declining around this pace into next year
anecdotes and common sense suggest that many prospective homebuyers leery of purchasing an asset whose value is falling are waiting for house prices to bottom out before entering the market  this behavior further saps already sagging housing demand  we dont have direct survey evidence for this supposition however the middle panels present some suggestive numbers taken from the michigan survey
first as shown by the black line in the panel to the left the share of current homeowners who think the price of their home fell over the past 12 months jumped dramatically through early this year and remains elevated  in addition the share that thinks the price will fall over the next 12 months also has drifted up  the panel on the right which is based on work by my colleague claudia sahm looks at the views of renters  here the blue bars show the percentage of renters in the michigan survey who say that now is a bad time to buy a house  the red line plots an estimate of house price overvaluation derived from a pricerent model that we follow  as you can see as houses became increasingly overvalued more and more renters became pessimistic about homebuyingapparently for affordability reasons  of course relative prices are not the only influence on affordability  general macroeconomic and credit market conditions also are important  thus even though the extent of overvaluation has diminished so far this year renters at least thus far remain quite pessimistic about homebuying conditions
so what brings us out of this seeming death spiral  if house prices follow the expected trajectory we estimate that they will move into rough alignment with their longrun relationship with rents early next year and then as typically happens overshoot somewhat  as the market returns to something closer to equilibrium prospective homebuyers who had been waiting out the price bubble in rental quarters should begin to see housing as more affordable and be more willing to buy into owneroccupied housing  as that happens the rate of decline in house prices should slow and sales of singlefamily homes the bottom left panel should start to improve  with demand improving and the inventory overhang being worked off we expect housing starts to level out and then begin to gain altitude slowly in 2009
exhibit 9 presents the mediumterm outlook for consumer spending and business investment  starting with pce real spending is projected to fall on balance in the second half of this year  tax rebates push up the third quarter and create a pothole in the fourth quarter as rebaterelated spending drops off  more fundamentally spending is held back by the effects of higher oil prices on household purchasing power the ongoing hit to household wealth from falling home prices and earlier declines in equity prices and the restraining effects of financial turmoil and unusually pessimistic consumer sentiment  in 2009 spending picks up as many of these factors begin to improve but at 1 percent the increase is still rather tepid
the middle panels focus on business outlays for equipment and software  real spending on the hightech component the green bars has slowed sharply this year
and is expected to remain relatively soft throughout the projection period  the major
us computer manufacturerssuch as hp dell and sunhave expressed caution about the outlook for sales  meanwhile capital spending guidance from telecommunications service providers points to a slowing in their outlays for communications equipment  as shown by the blue bars investment outside the high tech segment has been declining at a modest pace since late last year and we expect it to contract further over the next year and a half  spending is held back by normal accelerator effects tight lending standards and gloomy business sentiment
for nonresidential structures the lower panels the bea reported that outlays in the drilling and mining component the green bars dipped in the first quarter
anecdotal reports suggest that this may have reflected bottlenecks stemming from shortages of skilled labor and supplies  however recent data on footage drilled and the number of drilling rigs in operation have picked up signaling a nearterm rise in spending  looking forward escalating energy prices are likely to spur continued increases in investment  in contrast as shown by the blue bars real construction spending for buildings is projected to be very weak following sizable increases in 2006 and 2007  the evolving supplyanddemand factors for this sector are almost uniformly downbeat  vacancy rates are moving up sales and prices of existing properties are sagging and financing conditions are tight for new projects  because of these developments we expect outlays in this category to fall throughout the projection period  bill will now continue our presentation
mr wascher  exhibit 10 reviews our assumptions about aggregate supply as you can see from the first two rows of the table at the top we now assume that potential output growth will hold steady at about 2 percent per year over the forecast period about  percentage point per year higher from 2007 to 2009 than we had assumed in the april greenbook  this upward revision is split roughly equally between structural productivity growth lines 3 and 4 and trend hours lines 5 and 6
the middle two panels provide the reasoning for our change  the left panel shows the difference between actual productivity growth the black line and a simulation from our standard model the green line using the pace of structural productivity growth that we had assumed in april  as you can see labor productivity growth in recent quarters has been stronger than the model would have expected given the deceleration in economic activity  as shown in the inset box a purely statistical model based on a kalman filter would have responded to the recent data by raising its estimate of structural productivity growth 02 percentage point  because we place less weight on data that have not yet been through an annual revision we generally tend to revise our own estimate by less than the amount suggested by such models moreover the kalman filter model does not take into account the steep rise in energy prices which we think might subtract a bit from structural productivity growth in coming years  nevertheless we did think it appropriate to nudge up our productivity growth trend a little  the green line in the middle right panel shows a similar model simulation for the labor force participation rate again using our previously estimated trend  here too the incoming data have been a little higher
than the model would have expected  one can think of potential explanations for thisfor example it may be that strains on household budgets associated with rising costs of food and energy have increased labor force participation among secondary earners an influence not captured by the model  we are not ready to back away from our basic story that demographics will continue to put downward pressure on the participation rate over time but we did slightly raise our assumed trend in response to the recent data
the key elements of the labor market forecast are shown in the bottom panels  as indicated to the left nonfarm payroll employment the black line is projected to decline about 40000 per month through the rest of this year  as the economy improves in 2009 we expect payrolls to start rising again although at a pace below our estimate of trend employment growth the green line for most of the year  as shown in the inset box in the bottom right panel we expect the unemployment rate to drop back in june from its suspiciously high may reading which would leave the average jobless rate in the second quarter at 53 percent  however with employment declines projected to continue for a while longer we expect the unemployment rate to drift up to 57 percent by early next year and remain near that level through the end of 2009
exhibit 11 presents the nearterm inflation outlook  as you can see in the top left panel the recent data on consumer prices have come in a little lower than we had expected at the time of the april greenbook  as shown on line 3 core pce prices rose only 01 percent in april and based on the latest cpi and ppi readings we expect an increase of 02 percent in may  as a result we have marked down our estimate of core pce inflation in the second quarter by 03 percentage point to an annual rate of 2 percent  total pce prices line 1 have risen at a substantially faster pace than core prices but here too the currentquarter forecast is a little lower than  in our previous projection both because of the lower core inflation and because the sharp increases in oil prices have been slow to feed through to finished energy prices despite this recent news we expect inflation to rise sharply over the next few months in part this reflects our judgment that core prices were held down in the first half by some factors that will not persist into the second half  in addition as shown to the right we expect increases in food and energy prices to push up the twelvemonth change in the total pce price index more than 1 percentage point over the next several months to about 4 percent
the remaining panels of the exhibit focus on the projection for energy and food prices  as shown by the black line in the middle left panel rising crude oil prices have pushed up retail gasoline prices sharply so far this year  even so margins are still relatively low and we expect further sizable increases in pump prices in coming months  spot prices for natural gas the red line have also risen noticeably reflecting its substitutability with crude oil  meanwhile prices for crops plotted in black at the right have moved well above the levels at the time of the april greenbook mainly in response to the severe flooding in the midwest  the higher prices for grains have also pushed up livestock prices the blue line although recent
increases in supply have tempered this rise somewhat  in both cases futures prices indicate that market participants expect these prices to flatten out at about their current levels  the bottom two panels show our forecast for overall consumer food and energy prices  based on current futures prices we expect energy price inflation to move yet higher next quarter before slowing to a pace close to zero in 2009  we expect food prices to show a similaralbeit less pronouncedpattern with the four quarter change peaking at about 5 percent this quarter and then decelerating to a pace of 2 percent next year
the upper panels of your next exhibit examine the implications of the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices for core inflation  the first thing to note is that these increases are showing through to producers costs  as indicated in the top left panel the producer price index for core intermediate materials the black line has accelerated yet again and was up more than 7 percent over the past twelve months with especially large increases for metal products and energyintensive materials  likewise the diffusion index for prices paid from the institute for supply managements manufacturing survey the red line has climbed steadily since late last year  as nathan noted rising commodity prices have been an important source of the sizable increases in import prices shown to the right  in addition higher energy prices have boosted the costs of shipping goods from manufacturers to wholesalers and retailers  as you can see in the middle left panel the ppis for both trucking and rail transport have accelerated sharply over the past year or so  obviously a key question is the extent to which these higher costs will be passed through to core consumer prices  the panel to the right provides rough estimates of the size of these passthroughs from our suite of econometric models with the effect of energy prices on core pce inflation shown by the blue bars and the combined effects of import prices and other commodity prices indicated by the red bars  as you can see these effects add more than 06 percentage point to our forecast of core inflation this year with energy and import prices expected to decelerate the contribution of these factors to core inflation steps down to  percentage point next year
in contrast to the evidence of greater cost pressures from commodity prices weve seen no signs of acceleration in labor costs  the bottom left panel plots the three main measures of labor compensation that we follow  none of them suggests that employers have experienced a stepup in the pace of compensation growth and given the weaker labor market in our projection we dont think that workers will do much better over the next year and a half either  accordingly we expect the rise in trend unit labor costs shown in the table to the right to hold steady at about 2 percent per year over the projection period
in putting together our forecast weve also had to make some decisions about how to interpret the recent data on inflation expectationsthe subject of your final exhibit  as shown in the top left panel some measures of shortrun inflation expectations have jumped sharply in response to the runup in energy and food prices this year  in particular the reutersmichigan measure of oneyearahead expectations the blue line rose above 5 percent in may and remained high in the
preliminary june survey  meanwhile as shown to the right indicators of longrun inflation expectations have ranged from roughly unchanged to higher since late april as i already noted the recent compensation data do not suggest that higher inflation expectations have started to push up wage increases  however on balance we view the data as consistent with a slight updrift in the underlying longrun inflation expectations that drive actual inflation and we have carried this updrift into the projection period  all told we expect core pce inflation line 3 of the middle left table to step up to a 2 percent annual rate in the second half of this year pushed up by the effects of higher input costs and the increase in inflation expectations  in 2009 core inflation is projected to step back down to 2 percent as the effects of decelerating energy and import prices and a wider unemployment gap offset a small further updrift in expected inflation
we have taken only a small signal from the apparent deterioration in expected inflation but we view the possibility that inflation expectations will become unmoored in response to the persistently high rate of headline inflation as a risk to our forecast  accordingly as indicated in the box to the right we included in the greenbook an alternative simulation that assumes that longrun inflation expectations move up  percentage point relative to baseline in the third quarter  consistent with our usual practice monetary policy in this simulation is assumed to respond according to the estimated taylor rule  both wages and prices are affected by these higher inflation expectations and as you can see by the green line in the middle panel at the bottom core inflation rises to 26 percent in 2009 almost  percentage point higher than baseline  monetary policy responds in this simulation by raising the federal funds rate more than in the baseline forecast  as a result of this additional tightening the unemployment rate declines a bit more slowly and core inflation moderates to about 2 percent in 2012  brian will now continue the presentation
mr madigan3  i will be referring to the separate package labeled material for briefing on fomc participants economic projections  the top two sections of table 1 show the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for the first and second halves of 2008 central tendencies and ranges of the projections published by the committee this past april are shown in italics  to facilitate comparisons the greenbook projections are shown in the bottom section
in your forecast submissions most of you indicated that you saw appropriate monetary policy as entailing a path for the federal funds rate that lies above that assumed in the greenbook  as shown in the first row first column of table 1 the central tendency of your real growth forecasts for the first half of 2008 has been marked up substantially since april  however a number of you noted that recent upside surprises to consumer and business spending are likely to prove transitory and that falling house prices tight credit conditions and elevated energy prices will probably restrain growth over the remainder of 2008  accordingly some of you revised down a touch your growth expectations for the second half of this year the second column especially those of you who had previously anticipated the briskest

3  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 3
growth rates as indicated by the downward revision to the upper end of the range shown in the middle section  most of you think the economy will skirt recession nonetheless your projections for the speed of recovery over the second half exhibit considerable dispersion  four participants are projecting growth rates of real gdp between 2 and 2 percent whereas an equal number are calling for growth at an annual rate of only around  percent a pace similar to the one projected in the greenbook with many of you attributing the tepid growth partly to financial headwinds  the tendency for some clustering of your secondhalf growth forecasts at the extremes can be seen by noting the similarity between the central tendency and the range  as shown in the second set of rows in the top panel your projections for headline pce inflation in the second half of 2008 have been revised up more than
1 percentage point to around 3 to 4 percent largely as a result of the surge in prices of energy and agricultural commodities  however in view of betterthan expected news on core pce inflation the central tendency of your projections for core inflation during the second half shown in the third set of rows revised up only
01 percentage point
looking ahead to 2009 table 2 the middle column you continue to expect growth to pick up as the drag from the housing sector dissipates and credit conditions ease  the midpoint of the central tendency of your forecast for real gdp growth next year is 24 percent the same as in april and the same as the staffs current forecast
your growth forecasts for 2010 the third column are a shade lower than in april and the central tendency of your forecasts for the unemployment rate is a touch higher perhaps because a number of you assumed more policy tightening over the forecast period in order to counter heightened inflation pressures  the midpoint of the central tendency of your projections for the unemployment rate edges down from about 5 percent in 2009 to about 5 percent in 2010  your commentaries suggest that many albeit not all of you view those rates as a quarterpoint to a halfpoint above your estimates of the nairu  the third and fourth sets of rows indicate that most of you see overall and core inflation staying above 2 percent next year but by 2010 the extended period of economic slack and the assumed levelingout of energy prices push down overall and core inflation to around 1 to 2 percent for core inflation the central tendency and range are a touch higher than you forecasted in april  for the first time since you started these projections last october the upper end of the range of your projection of total inflation in 2010 exceeds 2 percent albeit marginally  thus many of you project that at the end of the forecast period the economy will still be operating with some slack and real output growth will be slightly above the growth rate of potential  the continued presence of slack suggests that you anticipate that inflation will continue to edge lower in 2011 and given the assumption of appropriate monetary policy implies that you typically anticipate that inflation will still be a bit higher in 2010 than you see as consistent with price stability
exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook  as shown by the green bars in the top two panels a large majority of you continue to perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside the left panel and many
judge that the degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for economic activity is unusually high the right panel although the number of you seeing uncertainty about growth as elevated has declined slightly over the first half of the year  in your narratives you attributed the downside risks primarily to the potential for steeper declines in house prices and persisting financial strains which through a further tightening of credit conditions could exert an unexpectedly large restraint on household and business spending  although your views of the risks regarding growth have shifted only modestly the distribution of your perceptions of the risks regarding inflation shown in the bottom two panels has changed significantly so far this year as shown in the lower left panel about threequarters of you now see the risks to the outlook for overall inflation as skewed to the upside  in your commentaries you typically pointed to continued increases in energy and food prices and an upward drift in inflation expectations as the main reasons for the upside risks to inflation  in addition as shown to the right the number of participants who perceive the degree of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook as larger than usual has risen considerably
turning to exhibit 4 as i noted your projections suggest that you do not see the economy as having fully settled into a steady state by 2010  the dynamics of the economy evidently are such that following moderately large shocks it can take quite a few years to converge back to steady state a view that is captured by many econometric models such as frbus and is also reflected in the current greenbook forecast  thus the threeyear forecast horizon currently used by the committee does not necessarily allow your forecasts to reveal fully your views of the steadystate characteristics of the economy and your views of the rate of inflation consistent with the dual mandate  recognizing this the subcommittee on communications recently sent the committee a memo outlining several possible approaches to providing longerterm projections  the approaches are summarized in the lower panel
one option would be for participants to extend their entire set of projections out to say five years  under this option participants would be asked to submit projections for economic variables in year 4 as well as in year 5  you would also expand your individual forecast narratives to explain the trajectory of the economy and inflation over the fiveyear projection period  this approach would have the advantage of providing the basis for a complete presentation of the committees mediumterm and longterm views  the principal disadvantage of this option is the relatively heavy burden it places on committee participants to make projections covering five years  another disadvantage is that in some circumstancesthat is following a very large shockthe economy still may not be in a steady state after five years
a second option is for participants to continue to submit economic projections and narratives out to three years as now but also to provide estimates of the values of output growth unemployment and inflation in year 5 under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy  under this approach you might wish to collect and publish longterm projections only for output growth unemployment and total inflation and not for core inflation in order to emphasize that total inflation rather
than core inflation is the appropriate metric for the longerrun goal of price stability this second approach presumably places less demand on your time than the first but it would make for a less integrated presentation  it would also suffer from the same defect as the first approach in that the figures you submit might not reveal the steady state characteristics of the economy after a large shock
in a third approach you would augment your threeyear projections with projections of the average values for output growth unemployment and total inflation over the period five to ten years ahead  this approach would have the advantage of more directly revealing your estimates of the key operating characteristics of the economythat is the parameters related to productive capacity and your inflation objective  it might also be less demanding of your time in the sense that you would need to project fewer time periods than in the first option  on the other hand it might be more difficult in that you would need to consider likely trends in demographic variables and productivity further ahead than is ordinarily necessary for monetary policy making  moreover it is possible that some of the parameters you would be supplying for the period five to ten years ahead might take on different values than would apply to the medium term that is relevant for monetary policy
in your comments in the upcoming economic goround you may wish to express your views on whether you support publication of longerrun projections and if so which of the approaches you prefer  you might also wish to comment on the desirability of conducting a trial run with longterm projectionssay in october before going live with longterm projections perhaps in january  that concludes our prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you brian  are there questions for our colleagues
president fisher
mr fisher  if i may i would like to ask nathan mr chairman about exhibit 4 and
exhibit 5  particularly noteworthy is that exhibit 4 is the forecast period showing a significant
decline in inflation in the emerging market economies  i am wondering what that is based on
do we have a sense of capacity utilization or slack if it is all reliable or is it based on a sense of
commodity prices  what is that noticeable downswoop
mr sheets  you are asking particularly with respect to the emerging market
economies
mr fisher  yes sir  in the top lefthand panel
mr sheets  in the process of preparing our forecast we do come up with estimates of
slack for the emerging market economies but we are not inclined to put a whole lot of weight on
them  the concept of an output gap is not really a welldefined construct for say china
nevertheless these economies will be growing a little more slowly than they have in the past
and some of the pressures on resources associated with that growth may abate a bit  i think that
is at least a piece of the story of what you see here as the decline  but at the end of the day it
has to be a story about commodity prices  food prices and energy prices have pushed this up
depending on exactly which emerging market economy youre in food prices will range
anywhere from 25 percent to 33 percent of their basket  as long as those food prices and energy
prices are moving up dramatically you are going to see rapid increases in inflation  so the
decline that you are seeing in this chart really is conditioned first and foremost on commodity
prices flattening out  i wish i had a better story
mr fisher  you dont know how happy i am to see global things come first  but are
you saying that a great deal of uncertainty is attached to that forecast
mr sheets  oh absolutely
mr fisher  then in exhibit 5 on core import prices i guess it is pretty much the same
answer  one would expect that these would fall of their own weight after a while
mr sheets  yes  the spike that we have seen is driven particularly by commodity
prices  the depreciation of the dollar has played a secondary role so the decline in core import
price inflation to below 2 percent next year is conditioned crucially on commodity prices
flattening out and the dollar not depreciating as rapidly as it has over the past few years
mr fisher  mr chairman if i could ask just one other questionof larry i think it
wason the housing exhibits  i am wondering if we are not in the eye of the storm here  we
have had the first wave of buckling at the kneesor worse cascading  if you talk to the
homebuilders they are of course the most depressed group imaginable  but they are waiting
for another shoe to drop which is the foreclosures on altas  im wondering what our opinion is
on that  things have calmed down a bit but we still have another phase of the storm coming
through which is what i just described  what are our assumptions about that
mr slifman  we expect foreclosures to riseand to rise appreciably  one thing we
have done in thinking about house prices is in effect to build in some extra houseprice
depreciation above and beyond what our pricerent model would want to say to reflect the
kinds of factors that you are talking aboutthe foreclosures what that means then for the
vacancy rate and what that does to house prices particularly in certain parts of the country  i
see president yellen nodding her head because california for sure is one place where that could
clearly be an important factor
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  id like to ask a question about inflation and
labor compensation  at the last meeting many of us myself included mentioned that labor
compensation had not been growing very strongly and we took that as a possible comforting
comment about inflationary pressures not being too strong  that comment was in this presentation
and yesterdays too  now statistically isnt it the case that labor compensation is not really a good
predictor of inflation  it really tends to lag more  so how should we think about interpreting that
lack of acceleration for inflation expectations and pressures  feel free to dispute that
mr wascher  no i agree with you  i think our models have been surprised by the low
rates of compensation growth  one way to think about it is that in the past we might have seen
higher headline inflation passed through more quickly to compensation growthas in the 70s
when those wageprice spirals were really led by prices but then wages contributed by following
so far we havent seen any sign that higher headline inflation has been putting upward pressure on
compensation costs  i think theres a risk  we obviously included the simulation because we think
theres a risk that could happen in the future but to date we have not seen evidence that thats been
the case  there are a number of reasons to think that things now might be different than they used
to be  for example just a structural reason unions are less powerful than they used to be a much
smaller share of the work force is unionized  in the 1970s there were all sorts of automatic costof
living adjustment clauses  even when there werent there were big catchups for past inflation
another structural reason might be that the minimum wage was higher in the 1970s and it is lower
in real terms now  i think more generally this fits in with the general notion that inflation
expectations are less responsive to immediate shocks in headline inflation than perhaps they used to
be
mr stockton  from a forecasting perspective president evans i think youre right  i
dont think models that rely simply on labor costs to predict prices are very sound in terms of their
forecasting ability versus just a plain old priceprice type of phillips curve or a price type of phillips
curve augmented with price expectations  part of the reason may be that the compensation data
themselves are just so poor that in fact its really a measurement problem  its not that you would
argue that labor costs which are a very significant chunk of overall business costs dont matter  i
do think you can probably take and we certainly have taken some limited comfort from the fact
that we have not yet seen an acceleration of labor costs  that likely indicates that you are not
seriously behind the curve already or that something is baked in the cake  i dont think you can
necessarily take comfort from the wellbehaved compensation thus far that you are not going to
confront some inflation problems going forward  its more that the compensation data dont
suggest that youve fallen seriously behind the curve  in some sense we see the higher inflation
expectations readings themselves or at least some of the mixedtoslightlyhigher inflation
expectations data as suggesting that youre facing a bit more of an inflationary difficulty over the
next two years than we thought two months ago would be the case
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  just a quick followup mr chairman  to what extent do you impute the
kind of insecurity that comes from competition and broader outsourcing  if you impute anything
there in terms of wage behavior here to what extent are you assuming going forward that the
increase in wages being paid elsewhere might bleed into our wage behavior here
mr wascher  well we dont account for that in our compensation model  that said
as i mentioned the models have been surprised about how low compensation has been  that would
be one possible explanation for that residual  if that factor were to diminish it would imply that that
residual would diminish but we havent built such an effect into our forecast
mr fisher  thank you
chairman bernanke  other questions  president bullard
mr bullard  i want to ask a question about exhibit 7 which talks about factors
affecting the gdp forecast  the second bullet point mentions judgmental adjustments which were
tempered this time relative to last time  last time i described this as a regimeswitching model and
you said that was perhaps too much  the economy sort of switches into this recessionlike
behavior and we know that the economy might behave differently in that environment  but do we
now think the probability of switching into that behavior is smaller  what is the forecast  is the
forecast some kind of average between this high state and this low state  thats what you said
hereit has tempered our judgmental adjustments  it sounds as though there is less probability of
switching into that state
mr slifman  its hard for me to think of it in these probabilistic terms  i would say that
we still think that the economy is going to have these negative effects that are associated with
periods of low growth  now whether that is precisely a recession or simply just a lowgrowth
period its hard for me to distinguish
mr bullard  but the rationale is that you switch into the recession and you get the
correlations from
mr slifman  yes  the way to think about it is that we switched into a lowgrowth
period  whether it is precisely a recession or just simply a lowgrowth period shouldnt be the
demarcation point  we still think that the economy is operating in a lowgrowth period  there is
probably not as much severity to that lowgrowth period but we still think that is where its
operating
mr bullard  but then youre switching into the lowgrowth period and then we take
the correlations for lowgrowth periods which i guess are maybe not as severe as in recession
periods
mr slifman  just as a factoid to throw out here one of my colleagues on the board
staff jeremy nalewaik has estimated some of these models looking at switching between high
growth periods and lowgrowth periods where a lowgrowth period does not necessarily have to be
a recession  using the gdp data through the first quarter plus our forecast for secondquarter gdp
which is now at an annual rate of 17 percent his model still would suggest that theres an
84 percent probability that the economy is operating in a lowgrowth state  so i think that it was a
fair thing for us to continue to have the judgmental adjustments which by the way arent just
recessionlike effects  they also include financial turmoil effects and some uncertainty things  i
think its a fair thing for us to have included those but as i say weve tempered them
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  i want to make sure i understand what you just said  your response
suggests that theres a third state thats even worse than we are in now that one could possibly go
into and that what youve tempered is the probability that were in that worst state
mr stockton  again we want to step back a bit from taking this regimeswitching too
seriously as implying that there are just two states of the world or maybe three states of the world
there are lots of different states of the world  what we are trying to do is look at the residuals in
our spending equations and ask how they behave in various kinds of periods  in periods with
substantial increases in the unemployment rate weak payroll employment and big declines in
consumer sentiment there also are substantial negative residuals in our spending equations
particularly on the consumer spending side  that is still built into this forecast  so we have not
interpreted the last six weeks of data as suggesting that recession concerns are all behind us that we
were just completely wrong and that we are now on a much stronger growth path than we
previously thought  if in fact youre worried that the incoming data might be signaling a stronger
growth path then i would take a look at the upside risk scenario that we show in the greenbook
there we take out all of our spending residualsthose that are incorporated because we thought we
might be in this lowgrowth or recessionarylike state and the ones that are associated with financial
turmoiland you get growth in that case that is a little above potential growth and a path for the fed
funds rate that is even steeper than the current market expectations
now although we kept these negative residuals in our forecast we did have to acknowledge
the fact that underlying aggregate demand appeared stronger than we thought it was going to be at
the time of the last fomc meeting  there is an underlying strengthening of aggregate demand in
this forecast that shows up as an increase in the equilibrium funds rate of roughly  percentage
point  so were trying to acknowledge the strength of the incoming data but we want to be clear
that this forecast still embeds some significant negative addfactors on spending going forward
that could be wrong  maybe the incoming data are signaling that we are just fundamentally wrong
about that aspect of the forecast  as larry showed given the stunning decline in consumer
sentiment the continued weak business sentiment and the fact that the unemployment rate has risen
as much as it has and has done this in the past only in periods of recession we felt comfortable still
presenting you with a forecast that anticipates that aggregate demand is going to be very weak over
the next several quarters
mr lacker  i dont want to belabor this too much  i was curious about what you
tempered  i think president bullard was looking for whether you tempered the probability on
state 2  im with you in not wanting to place a lot of probability on n states but it sounds as though
the growth trajectoryyou know the magnitude of the addfactors you were thinking ofhas been
drawn back a little  is that a fair characterization
mr stockton  thats correctand the timing  so there are two aspects  one is that
we have interpreted some of the surprise as a persistent strengthening in aggregate demand that we
had not anticipated  the other is that the economy is not as weak now and therefore the
bounceback in activity next year wont be as strong  as larry said there are a lot of moving parts
but both of those considerations are built into this forecast
mr lacker  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  any other questions  okay  we are about
ready for our goround  let me remind you about the proposal to add a longterm line to our
projections  the rationale for doing so is that the current system doesnt necessarily let the
public know what our views on the steady state of the economy are  to show my own hand i
think it would be helpful to add maybe one line that said in five to seven years out what we think
the economy would do  but i think it is important for those of us who want to express an
opinion to do so  if there is interest as brian mentioned we can do a trial run in october and
we wont have to make a final decision about whether to go forward until october or december
or perhaps later depending on how things go  but if you have a view on that please add that to
your commentary  so lets begin with the economic goround and well start with president
hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman i will begin my remarks this afternoon with a brief update
on the conditions in our district  overall district economic activity continues to expand
moderately with strengthened energy agriculture and export manufacturing more than
offsetting the softness in our housing retail sales and other types of manufacturing activity
district labor markets continue to perform reasonably well  while job growth has slowed over
the past few months unemployment remains very low and many sectors continue to have
difficulty finding workers especially skilled ones  evidence on wage pressures is mixed
although wage pressures have moderated somewhat in our beige book survey some recent
labor union contracts have built in rising profiles for hourly wage increases over the term of the
contract  rising energy and commodity input prices are continuing to negatively affect our
district economic activity
reports from businesses suggest that higher energy and food prices are being quickly
passed on to the customer now  however businesses are having mixed success in passing on
other cost increases resulting in some severe erosion in margins and profitability in some of the
firms  to illustrate some of the costprice dynamics i would like to take just a minute and relate
the recent experience of one of our branch directors who operates a multiline manufacturing
firm  i mention this because i am hearing it more and more  in addition to rising fuel prices his
business has seen a doubling in steel costs since january with july quotes on steel tubing up an
additional 25 percent  in response his company recently announced a price increase of 16 to
18 percent across a range of products  competitors immediately matched or exceeded his price
increases  notably he made these price increases despite a decline in new orders in may  he
also noted that import prices from china that he has seen have risen 28 percent this year and that
ocean freight prices have risen about 20 percent  as a result customers who previously bought
chinese products are now purchasing usmanufactured goods  it is interestingi talked with
some of the folks at union pacific and their shipments into the midwest have dropped slightly
but their shipments out have increased about 3 to 4 percent  so that is what is going on in the
region
more broadly turning to the national economy i have revised up my growth estimate for
the first half of 2008 but it has made little change in my longerrun outlook  compared with the
greenbook i see somewhat stronger growth in the second half of this year and somewhat weaker
growth next year and in 2010  most of the difference from the greenbook in 2009 and 2010
comes from the policy path assumptions  i assume that policy accommodation is removed at a
more rapid pace than does the greenbook  recent economic data suggest that although
downside risks to growth remain they have diminished  i continue to judge that the potential
spillover effects from the financial distress have understandably been overestimated in this
committees recent decisions and in greenbook forecasts in recent months  in my view the
greater risks to the outlook come from rising energy and commodity prices and less from the
financial distress as we go forward  in my view current policy accommodation is greater than
needed to address these risks
as i indicated at the last meeting i believe that the upside risks to inflation have
increased considerably over the past several months  like the greenbook i expect both overall
and core pce inflation to move higher in the second half of this year  if this happens and we
maintain the current level of the funds rate i believe we are likely to see further erosion in
inflation expectations which will undermine our credibility with financial markets and the
public  in this event i judge we will greatly increase the likelihood that we will need to raise
rates more aggressively taking rates above neutral in order to achieve our longerrun inflation
objectives and that is of significant concern to me mr chairman
turning to the issue of longterm projections let me comment that i have felt somewhat
constrained by the current threeyear horizon for our quarterly projections  of the options
presented by the subcommittee i am most comfortable with providing estimates of the values for
total inflation output growth and unemployment at which the economy is likely to converge  i
am not sure however how we want to label these estimates if they are included in the table  i
understand that putting these estimates out might be interpreted as a move closer to inflation
targeting but i think that this is a bridge we are ready to cross since we adopted the enhanced
projections process  the other options seem less desirable  given the resources required by my
staff at least i doubt that we could provide a meaningful forecast at a fouryear or fiveyear
horizon and i am not sure how projections for average values over a period of five to ten years
ahead would be interpreted by the public  in my view appropriate policy should be expected to
return the economy to its longrun equilibrium over a threetofiveyear period with the length
of the period depending on the nature of the shock  setting out a fivetotenyear horizon could
be construed as a weakening in our commitment to achieve our mandate in a timely manner
thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  the intermeeting period has been full of
surprises  realside data came in considerably stronger than i anticipated so like the greenbook
i have adjusted up my forecast for growth in the current quarter  at the same time the adverse
fundamentals that will weigh on household and business spending going forward have grown
somewhat heavier overall and that has prompted me to revise down my growth forecast for the
second half  on the inflation front readings on core inflation surprised to the downside
nonetheless given that the prices of many commodities have continued to rise more rapidly than
i anticipated and that some measures of inflation expectations have turned up i have adjusted up
my inflation forecast for 2008 considerably up for headline inflation and modestly up for core
inflation
the strong incoming data on spending eased my fears that we are in or are approaching a
recession regime of the sort embedded in the last two greenbooks  however given the
numerous large and worsening drags on spending a couple of months of data arent enough to
convince me that we are on a solid trajectory  moreover the spending data may well fail to
reflect the real underlying strength of consumer demand because of the effects of the tax rebates
spending patterns could easily be distorted by small differences between what we projected that
households would spend each month out of rebate checks and what they actually spent  in
monthly spending data a swing of just a few billion dollars looks enormous  perhaps
households who were already paying through the nose for food and gas and are increasingly
credit constrained have put their rebate checks to work a bit early this time  after all households
knew in advance that the checks were going out  for example google searches related to tax
rebates peaked in april  we actually kept track of the data on that  so i will be closely watching
the data over the next few months hoping to get a cleaner read on the underlying state of
consumer demand
as i said the adverse fundamentals are still with us and in some part are worsening
evidence that the credit crunch is ongoing is all too clear  bank asset quality continues to
deteriorate  banks continue to deleverage and they are tightening lending standards as they do
so  the market for privatelabel securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains
moribund  spreads on agencybacked mortgagebacked securities have risen during the
intermeeting period which are likely to spill over to the primary mortgage market with a lag
anecdotal reports suggest that the constraints on household borrowing continue to tighten  for
example two of my most senior bank supervisorsboth with fico scores in the stratosphere
have had their home equity lines slashed  one has deferred a planned home renovation project
as a consequence  if that is happening to them i can only imagine how hard it must be to get a
loan if you have a merely average credit rating
housing prices have also fallen at a somewhat faster rate than the greenbook previously
anticipated  given the overhang of homes for sale the recent rise in mortgage rates and the fact
that the homeownership rate is likely to continue trending lower i think the downward pressure
on home prices and construction will persist as the greenbook suggests  the greenbook is
actually at the conservative end in its estimates of the wealth effect  it assumes a marginal
propensity to consume out of housing wealth of about 3 cents on the dollar  in contrast a
number of recent estimates in the literature are in the 6 cent to 9 cent range  there is a clear risk
then that the combination of declining housing wealth and tightening credit could lead
households to restrict spending more and more persistently than anticipated
but the big adverse shock since the last meeting is oil prices which are up 25 a barrel
from the already elevated april levels  empirically since the mid1980s the estimated
responses to relatively exogenous increases in the relative price of oil have tended to look
qualitatively like the simulations in the bluebook and the board staffs special memo on oil
prices in which we are credible in our commitment to longterm price stability  most notably
the empirical estimates suggest at most a modest effect on core inflation  nominal wages barely
respond by some estimates they even fall slightly
the model results suggest that the outcomes we have seen in the actual data are crucially
dependent on our having credibility  with substantial target drift workers demand higher wages
which firms pay and then pass on  fortunately the anecdotes i hear are more consistent with
credibility than with an upward wageprice spiral  in particular my contacts uniformly report
that they see no signs of wage pressure  there also is no evidence of real wage rigidity in
response to energy prices  when energy prices have risen real wagesin product as well as
consumption termshave generally fallen  in other words real wages have been depressed in
the 2000s at least in part reflecting rising energy prices  but there is no sign that workers have
over a number of years tried to recoup these losses at the bargaining table  given the importance
of credibility the substantial increase in expected inflation in the michigan survey is concerning
but not yet alarming  i discount these readings somewhat because of analysis by my staff that
suggests that at either the oneyear or the fivetotenyear horizon consumers have always
tended to react strongly to contemporaneous inflation data
changes in credibility are fundamentally about changes in the process by which people
form expectations  but as far as consumer expectations are concerned that process appears
remarkably stable  for example if you use data through the early 2000s to estimate equations
that link inflation expectations to contemporaneous inflation you will find that those
relationships fit remarkably well out of sample  they dont show the systematic underprediction
of inflation expectations one might expect if the fed had suffered a significant loss of credibility
at this point  the dependence of consumer inflation expectations on recent data also leads me to
believe that they will fall if in fact headline inflation comes down as we are predicting as
commodity prices level off
furthermore i dont think that households elevated expectations will make it harder to
achieve our projections  earlier research suggested that surveys did in fact provide useful
information about future inflation  but during the past 15 or 20 years the actual inflation
process has become much less persistent even though households appear to assume otherwise
there is thus a notable divergence between the actual inflation process and the one that is
embodied in consumers inflation forecasts  as a result inflation forecasts incorporating
consumer expectations have been a lot less than stellar over this recent period  so it does not
appear unreasonable to believe that the effects of recent commodity price shocks will wear off
faster than consumers are expecting  an unresolved question is whose expectations matter for
the dynamics of inflation  i take some solace from the fact that 10year inflation expectations in
the survey of professional forecasters have been relatively stable since the late 1990s and from
the fact that fivetotenyear breakeven rates on tips are below their peaks from earlier in the
year
taken all together i think inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored  the
oil price increases have led me to raise my projections for overall pce inflation sharply  cost
pressures are likely to push core inflation up a bit though i see less passthrough than the
greenbook does  higher oil prices and interest rates and lower housing prices have led me to
modestly reduce my forecast of growth in the second half of this year and next year  my forecast
is predicated on fed funds rate increases that begin in december of this year gradually bringing
the funds rate to 4 percent in 2010
briefly on the issue of longterm economic projections i welcome greater transparency
about our longterm objectives  i think that would be beneficial and there is a good reason as
you have articulated to try to do that now given that for many of uscertainly for me2010 is
not long enough for me to project that the economy will have converged to a steady state  my
preference is to provide projections of the average values for output growth unemployment and
total inflation that are expected say five to ten years out  i think that these values can
communicate the necessary steadystate information without burdening us with forecasting every
year of the transition to the steady state  also i would favor conducting a trial in october
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman you are going to get a contrapuntal tune here  that is the
beauty of this table and the different perspectives around it  i am going to take a different
approach today than i have in the past  i am going to talk a bit about the eleventh district first
which i dont often do  the reason for that is because of its nature and size because of its being
the leading exporting state in the country now and because of its job creation it is in a slightly
different positionor significantly different position depending on which district it is compared
withfrom the rest of the country
our job growth through march is running about 38 percent  unemployment in april was
41 percent despite a sizable influx of immigrants which we see from new license plate
registrations from california and particularly from florida as well as from people still coming
across the border  sales of existing homes rose in may while inventories and prices held steady
apartment demand is robust and rents in the major cities such as dallas and houston are rising
the real export growth of texas was 72 percent in april after 39 percent in the first quarter
that is telling you that our chemicals are now being priced aggressively but also that everything
else is being priced aggressively worldwide  thats a significant export sector for us
importantly on the price front the dallas feds own texas manufacturing outlook survey and
the regional cpi data indicate continuing price increases and substantial evidence of pass
through to higher final goods prices  thirtynine percent of the respondents report the ability to
realize higher prices of finished goods currently another 45 percent expect to be able to realize
higher prices in the next six months  despite these strong numbers our soundings and our
instinct project a slowdown in the future  we have been projecting a slowdownwe havent
seen it  discretionary income has been bolstered by employment but squeezed by rising food
and energy prices and credit constriction  so we are looking for the district to slow and yet to
continue to outperform relatively speaking
i would like to devote the rest of my comments to the us economy and to the global
economy particularly to the contrapuntal insights i have gained from my soundings  first on
the global economy nathan our own research at our little globalization institute in dallas
indicates that the projections of real economic growth of most of the advanced countries are
being revised downward whereas expected inflation is being revised upward  for the major
emerging market economies growth realization at least as it appears in their forecasts for the
most part holds up but inflation expectations are being steadily revised upward  in other words
the two types of economies share on the inflation front whereas there is disparity and a little
cacophony as far as growth is concerned  we are working on it but we have yet to develop a
reliable measure of global slack  jpmorgan with whom we have been working has a slack
index that purports to be global  but as you pointed out nathan it excludes china  minor
oversight  it also excludes india
one would think that the growing slack in the advanced countries would be mitigating
price pressures  yet those countries with numerical price objectives or inflation targetsfrom
mexico to turkey to new zealand to the european central bank to the britsare now
contending with inflation in excess of their target or comfort range
i was thinking the other day of mervyn kings comment that once they had to write to
the chancellor of the exchequer it would lead to a lot of letterwriting  it took 15 years for the
first letter to be written after inflation targeting was embraced  of course two years ago this was
resurrected and now they seem to be doing so with a great deal more frequency  now there is a
risk of acquiring writers cramp  i would say that if we were under the same strictures as the
bank of england we might be subject to the same concerns  in our last meeting i posited that
something persistent and pernicious was occurring on the inflation front  mr chairman the one
thing that is even clearer nowparticularly after my soundings which ill report in just a
secondthan it was in may is that inflationary pressures inflation expectations and anticipatory
behavioral responses among consumers and businesses have intensified whereas our confidence
about economic growth has improved
i dont believe that we are out of the woods yet on the risk of a creditinduced slowdown
though i believe our liquidity initiatives are a proper and good palliative as you know  but if
robert frost will forgive me the woods are not lovely and they are indeed deep and dark on the
price front  although the tail risk of economic recession has diminished i think it still exists
certainly the anemiajust to use another word that you referred todoes  but the risk of
inflation in my view has assumed greater depth and breadth since we last met  stated
differently i dont believe that inflation expectations are presently well anchored here or
elsewhere  i believe they are beingjust to kill the sea analogy dontorn from their moorings
and are at risk of going adrift
now i took a different approach this time with the 30odd interlocutors with whom i
discussed the outlook  i simply asked them one question  what is different in this cycle from
what you have seen before  most of these people have been in business for 30 years plus  here
are some sample testimonials as to what they are seeing  the ceo of fluor which has a 38
billion backlog currently said when i started here in 1974 we put inflation contingencies into
every contract  in the 1990s that had not only gone away but we were confident we could
negotiate cost down to below what we were bidding  now it is just the opposite  the cfo of
fritolay which just pushed through a 9 percent price increase which parenthetically wal
mart accommodated at 7 percent said most of our executives are in their late 30s or earlyto
mid 40s  they have never seen these kinds of numbers  this is reminiscent of the aftershock to
nixons wage and price controls and we are currently having to hold seminars to teach
management how to manage inflation  from the ceo of walmart usa  we see
increasedand this is his wordpervasive price pressures  i am telling you that we have an
economy where the real people are being trampled by inflation and for the first time in memory
we are getting noise from employees about the cost of living  walmart raised the pay of 60
percent of their associates between single and double digits in the last quarter and my contact
said we are now contemplating a series of measures such as providing discounts to employees
to counter considerable employee angst about the cost of living  from the ceo of kimberly
clarke who just notified the retailers of a 7 percent price increase to come in august after the 7
percent they pushed through in february in addition to which they are going to add a shipping
surcharge  customers are no longer asking if but when we will increase prices so they can
move in anticipation
i can give you other testimonials mr chairman  one of my favorites by the way has to
do with a very small operation a threestore dry cleaning operation faulkners fine dry
cleaning in dallas  they approached me the other day to say that they would have to increase
the price of cleaning our shirts because the price of 18inch white hangers which are steelbased
has increased 65 percent  they showed me the circular that had been sent around by the fabric
cleaning supply company that is the last remaining manufacturer of hangers in the united states
all of that manufacturing has gone to china  the circular that they are sending their customers
the cleaners says what should cleaners do  raise your prices  youre worth it  thenand
this strikes at the heart of every son of every australianbudweiser which raised its prices 3
percent in february according to our local distributor plans to raise 3 percent again in
september  and the bud distributor in north texas who has had that distributorship for 43
years said that never before in his lifetime had he seen two price increases in one year  finally
the ceo of jcpenneys just returned from an aroundtheworld buying trip  after 11 years of
apparel price deflation chinese manufacturers are seeking 8 to 9 percent price increases in 09
11 to 12 percent for footwear and for small kitchen appliances in the mid20s  the cfo of the
company told me that they are running at minimum staffing levels  if anybody begins to break
the wage barrier then katie bar the door
so mr chairman i would say that currently our patientthe economyis indeed a sick
puppy  some of its vital organsgeographic regions such as the one i am fortunate to live in or
a strong export sector of the united states or entrepreneurs and business leaders who have
learned to wring unanticipated efficiency and profits out of globalization or from within
cyberspaceare very strong  yet othersstates like california and florida the housing sector
and overall consumer confidenceare bleeding if not hemorrhaging  this is not to mention the
still precarious state despite the very good report that bill gave of our financial system as it
recovers i hope with our help from years of its recklessness and excess  i think we have like
loyal practitioners and with the equivalent of the hippocratic oath done the job that we are
expected to do in terms of resuscitating the victim
that is the good news  the real bad news is that our patient appears to be acquiring a
staph infection in this hospital that we have created and that staph infection is inflation  i
believe inflation is upon us  i believe expectations are discounting more inflation  very
importantlyand this is tough to get from the modelsi believe that behavioral changes are
beginning to manifest themselves  now some would argue that this infection is temporary and
may well go away  others will argue that it will be stayed by strong rhetoric  still others say
that it will requirei dont know if its an antibiotic or an antidotefurther tightening lest the
infection spread and counteract the good that we have done with our liquidity facilities and by
previous policy decisions  that seems to me to be the problem that we will have to deal with at
this meeting and i look forward to hearing my other colleagues opinions  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i would like to start with some anecdotal
feedback from the region  as you know we have a lot of branches so we have a lot of
directors and we ask our directors a lot of questions  the anecdotal feedback from our 44
directors about the second half can be characterized as subdued  almost all reported that they
expect economic activity to be flat or slower and i took special note that these expectations
deteriorated in june after having actually improved a bit in may
the residential housing situation in the district resembles the national picture  both sales
and new construction are weak  high levels of inventories are being exacerbated by
foreclosures which are adding to downward pressure on prices  however there are tentative
signs of a bottom forming  our survey of realtors across the district indicates that the pace of
decline of singlefamily home sales may be abating  industry contacts tell us that foot traffic and
buyer interest are picking up particularly in florida although i would say that what constitutes
progress in florida would not be considered very encouraging elsewhere  nevertheless our
view is that the beginning of an adjustment process is under way but the end of the process
looks to be a long way off  some further homeprice deterioration is likely to accompany this
bottoming process
credit conditions in the district continue to tighten because of perceived risk and also
liquidity pressure on our banks  our banks indicate that the process of deleveraging continues
which is affecting lending for residential real estate and to some extent commercial real estate
we are also hearing from several sources that funding of community banks is becoming an
increasing problem because of their previous dependence on wholesale and correspondent bank
sources  higher energy prices are not surprisingly affecting our outlook  hospitality industry
contacts for instance expressed concern about low summer bookings  although most tourist
destinations have reported solid activity to date few expect this to continue
the reacceleration of energy and commodity price inflation has businesses focused on
cost pressures  several business contacts indicated that price increases had been relatively easy
to pass through and make stick in this environment  i wouldnt say that its widespread yet but i
do hear some reports that businesses are expecting wage increases to eventually reflect the recent
increases in the cost of living  this could be a significant factor particularly in service price
inflation  this and other anecdotal input has colored my outlook for the national economy for
the balance of the year and into 2009  i have revised up my forecast for headline inflation in
2008 and 2009 by 50 and 25 basis points respectively  i am also assuming that the recent
inflationary pressures from elevated energy and food prices will unwind more slowly than i
previously projecteda view reinforced by expectations expressed by my district contacts
like everyone else i am deeply concerned that inflation expectations seem to be rising and that
expectations of general price inflation reflecting second third and fourthorder effects of
recent oil and commodity price rises risk becoming institutionalized  i am prepared in the near
term to think tactically regarding the conflict between growth and employment policy objectives
and inflation objectives but sustained inflationary pressures that extend well into the fourth
quarter and rising expectation readings may force at least on my part a more strategic look at
the tradeoff
i would like to talk for a moment about financial markets  i made a number of calls
during the intermeeting period and the growthversusinflation tactical dilemma is complicated
further by a very mixed picture in financial markets  my contacts all acknowledge improved
conditions since midmarch but discussion of the current market circumstances and the outlook
had a sort of halffullhalfempty quality  my contacts taken together pointed to several
positives including the health of the corporate loan market improved cdo pricing the
readiness of forming distressed funds to buy assetbacked securities alta mortgage demand the
growing perception that subprime loss estimates have been overstated and some comment on
goldmans cheyne deal which they believe will help create price determination for certain
securities  at the same time these contacts cited areas of continuing or worsening weakness
including helocs and second mortgages option arms and alta hybrids indirect auto given
the collateral value of suvs in current circumstances in contrast to cdo pricing cdo squared
pricing is very weak and deteriorating the obvious concern about the growing liquidity issues of
regional banks and the view that the auction rate securities market valuations given illiquidity
are suggesting that this market has little probability of returning to normalcy  overall my
contacts in financial markets were encouraged but expressed worries over stillsubstantial
downside potential
let me turn now to my national forecast compared with the greenbook forecast  the
atlanta projections for the national economy are broadly similar to those of the greenbook  we
have the same general narrative of slow growth for the balance of the year followed by a gradual
pickup through 2009 and 2010  my projections for headline and core inflation are virtually
identical to the baseline greenbook projections  however i believe that there may be less
disinflationary pressure than seems implicit in the board staffs forecast  as a consequence the
fed funds rate path that supports my inflation outlook is well above the greenbooks at the end of
2009 and 2010  we are 75 basis points higher at yearend 2009 and 100 basis points higher at
yearend 2010  notwithstanding the upward revision of the firstquarter gdp number and the
better expectations for this quarter i still believe the nearterm risks to growth are weighted to
the downside  at the same time as suggested by my revised forecast i see the risks to our
inflation objective as weighted to the upside
on the subject of the longterm projections i favor the third approach which is three
years plus longterm averages and certainly would be comfortable with approach number 2  im
generally dubious about the ability to do actual forecasting for the outyears even as nearterm as
the third year  so i really dont favor approach number 1  my experience in the brief time i
have been with the fed has at least personally been shall i say challenging from the point of
view of forecasting  i tend to think of the longterm projections as being roughly equivalent to
our targets or policy goals  in fact the approach we have generally taken with our threeyear
forecasts is making the outyear approaching at least what we would consider to be the trend rate
for growth and the employment and inflation objective  so i think longterm projections really
do amount to moreexplicit targeting and very likely the first question we get when we come out
of the blocksif we have this kind of approachwill be is this your target  i am comfortable
saying yes to that question and therefore would support the third approach  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  despite some encouraging data
recently the boston fed economic outlook continues to see the economy growing below
potential over the next several quarters further weakening in labor markets and core pce
trending down in response to excess capacity  overall our forecast has not changed significantly
since our april meeting  i view recent strength in consumer spending indicators as largely
borrowing from the second half of this year  this view is supported by the assessment that apart
from the fiscal stimulus consumption fundamentalsincome wealth and employmentremain
on the weak side
taking on board some of the increase in the may unemployment rate our forecast has the
unemployment rate peaking at a slightly higher rate than at the last meeting  in this respect we
are similar to many other forecasters  the may blue chip forecast had unemployment peaking
at 56 percent  the june blue chip forecast for unemployment peaks at 57 percent  while the
greenbook has the unemployment rate peaking at 57 percent as it did in april it has the
unemployment rate at 56 percent at the end of 200901 percent higher than the april
greenbook  so at least as measured by the unemployment rate there seems little improvement
in the outlook since the april meeting  as in the greenbook residential investment in our
forecast continues to be a drag on the economy in 2009 and consumption holds up primarily as a
result of the fiscal stimulus package which is in part offsetting the negative impact of
significantly higher oil prices on consumption  a major uncertainty remains whether further
homeprice declines will have a more negative effect on residential investment and consumption
than we currently have in our forecast
similarly i would view financial market conditions as not having changed significantly
since our april meeting  the threemonth liborois spread remains quite high by historical
standards at roughly 70 basis points where it has been trading since the april fomc  the dow
jones sp 500 and nasdaq indexes have all declined since our april meeting  investment
banks such as merrill lynch and lehman brothers are now trading substantially below where
they were trading at our april meeting and below where they traded during the middle of march
when bear stearns experienced difficulties  stock prices for large regional banks have declined
as they have needed to increase loanloss reserves raise new capital and reduce dividend
payments  i continue to be concerned that we have more significant difficulties ahead for many
financial institutions  first and second mortgages and home equity lines of credit are
deteriorating at many banks as falling home prices and job losses create problems that have now
spread to some prime residential products  i would characterize financial markets as remaining
fragile  the past two taf auctions still produced stopout rates above the primary credit rate
and financial markets remain susceptible to event risk  the recent flurry of articles on lehman
before their announcement of their capital infusion highlights continued concerns about
investment banks despite our new liquidity facilities  as a result i continue to view the
downside risk of further financial shocks as being significant
core pce inflation has trended lower during this quarter bringing the fourquarter
change for the past year to 21 percent  given that the boston fed forecast expects significant
excess capacity over this year we forecast that core pce inflation will be slightly below
2 percent in 2009  if food and energy prices stabilize we expect total pce to converge to core
pce  we have experienced significant food and energy shocks and oil prices continue to be
higher than our expectations  i would be quite concerned should the serially correlated surprises
in food and energy become embedded in inflation expectations and wages and salaries  but a
critical element to my forecast is that total pce inflation converges to core pce as wage and
salary increases remain largely unaffected by the supply shocks  in the data to date wage and
salary increases have not trended up in response to the supply shocks and my expectation is that
excess capacity in labor markets and continued competition from abroad make it unlikely that the
relative change in food and energy prices will become embedded in labor contracts
for the intermediate term i remain focused on core pce rather than total pce for several
reasons  first monetary policy is unlikely to have much effect on food and energy prices which
are responding among other developments to the impact of natural disasters such as flooding in
the midwest and manmade disasters such as ongoing political difficulties in nigeria and the
middle east  second statistical evidence provided by our research department seems to indicate
that over the past 20 years when total and core inflation diverge total has tended to converge to
core and not the opposite  third while inflation expectations are difficult to model the lack of
an upward trend in wages and salaries seems consistent with worker expectations being driven
by core rather than total inflation  while the supply shocks may have increased the upside
inflation risks the downside risks to the economy and financial markets remain quite elevated
in my view we need more time and data to determine with greater confidence which of these
risks poses the greatest danger to the economy
in terms of the options i am comfortable with either 1 or 3  i have a slight preference for
option 1  it is not that difficult for us to extend our forecast out five years  i actually think it
would be easier to explain to the public than option 3 and i think explaining to the public is one
of the main goals of expanding the forecast  but i could be happy with either option
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  in the third district as anticipated
manufacturing activity residential construction and employment have remained weak
nonresidential construction has now softened although vacancy rates in philadelphia and around
the district remain relatively low  retail sales remain sluggish  bank lending has been
restrained  the outlook among our business contacts however varies significantly by sector
manufacturers expect a rebound in activity over the coming six months and residential real
estate contacts report that they believe market conditions may be near bottom although they
expect any recovery to be slow  interestingly enough it is the same sort of anecdotal evidence
that president lockhart referred to  now it is hard to know whether it is just mostly wishful
thinking or whether there is something real therealthough his saying it and my saying it sort of
reinforces it a little  but it is the first time that i have heard such news in a very very long time
retailers are quite pessimistic however because they are expecting the increase in energy prices
to limit sales especially among lowerincome customers despite the tax rebates
despite the soft economic conditions the most prominent concern that we have heard
from our business contacts across a variety of industries is the runup in commodity prices and
other prices  thus far firms have resisted passing along their rising costs to customers to the
extent that they could but many firms tell us that they have gone as far as they can on holding
the line on their own prices and plan to raise prices further in the next few months  some firms
are including general costincrease clauses in their new contracts  earlier we saw various sorts
of fuel surcharges added onto prices but now contracts are being written in a way that includes
broad costadjustment increases  this is still only anecdotal evidence although it has been
referred toi think president fisher made a couple of comments in this regard  but it may be
yet another early warning sign that inflation expectations cannot remain in check indefinitely in
this current environment  in june the pricespaid index in our business outlook survey of
manufacturers rose to the highest level it has been since 1980  manufacturers and firm contacts
across a wide range of industries say that they expect their input prices and the prices of their
own goods to increase further over the next six months  they see no abatement of price
pressures in the near term or medium term and are very pessimistic about inflation
the national economic situation is similar to what i see in my own district and it is an
uncomfortable situation for all of us  the data we have received on economic activity over the
intermeeting period have come in slightly better than i expected but the continued price
increases particularly in oil and commodities have been a very unpleasant development
certainly economic conditions remain weak and the recent positive news may prove to be
transitory  from the financial side credit spreads have fallen bond issuance has risen and it
appears that financial market functioning has at least improved  in my view although downside
risks to growth remain the tail risk of a very bad outcome has clearly been diminished
i expect gdp growth to come in around 17 percent this yearonly marginally higher
than my april projectionbefore picking back up to trend of around 27 percent in 200910
despite the upward revisions in the greenbook baseline my forecast remains somewhat more
optimistic for growth in 2008 and 2009 than the greenbook  in fact my forecast is similar to the
board staffs upside risk alternative scenario which essentially removed the downward
adjustment factors the staff added to build in more recessionlike features caused by the financial
turmoil and other factors not captured in their baseline model which is what dave was
mentioning earlier
my concerns about the inflation outlook have increased since our last meeting  i am not
alone  inflation has become a predominant concern for many businesses and consumers and you
only have to read the newspapers to see that  obviously monetary policy cannot control the
price of energy but we do have a responsibility to act to keep broadbased inflation under
control  contributing to the increase in inflation risk is not only the surge in energy and other
commodity prices it is supported also by our own accommodative stance of monetary policy
shortterm inflation expectations and headline inflation measures are up significantly since our
last meeting  so far core inflation increases have been modest and longterm inflation
expectations remain although volatile within a tolerable range  but if we continue to maintain
the real funds rate well below zero despite inflation that is well above acceptable levels can we
really expect inflation expectations to remain anchored  we must remember that longerterm
inflation expectations tend to lag inflation not to lead it  if we wait until these measures rise we
will be too late
apropos of president evanss question about wages i have been troubled by stories in
the press suggesting that we can be less concerned about inflation than we were in the 1970s
because wages havent risen and labor unions are less prominent  these stories suggest that the
wageprice spiral caused the unanchoring of inflation expectations in the 70s  but i think this
gets the direction of causation backwards  in my view the story of the 70s was that the public
lacked confidence in the central banks commitment to price stabilityit didnt believe the
central bank would take the necessary steps to bring inflation under control  as a consequence
inflation expectations rose and wages rose  it was the higher inflation and the lack of credibility
that led to higher wage demands
the key to avoiding such a situation in my view is maintaining the credibility that the
fed has worked so hard to achieve  the board staff memo on optimal monetary policy in the
context of higher oil prices illustrates the importance of maintaining credibility and i want to
thank the staff for their efforts in this regard  i think it was an excellent piece of work  as they
clearly say the critical factor in containing inflation through an expectations channel is the belief
that policymakers will always adhere to a fullcommitment rule  when the central bank is
unable or unwilling to commit in a credible manner to future policy actions or to a longrun
inflation goal the result is both higher inflation and lower output  in the real world of course
full commitment can never absolutely be achieved  but beliefs about which regime better
approximates reality are informed by the actions taken by the central bank to maintain its
commitment to price stability
i believe that the fomc has done a good job with our wordsincluding fomc
statements minutes and speechesin helping to anchor longerterm expectations  i believe the
chairmans speech at the boston fed conference earlier this month delivered a wellarticulated
and important message about the importance of keeping longerterm inflation expectations
anchored  but our credibility rests on more than just words  we must act in a way that is
consistent with our hardearned reputation or our credibility could soon vanish  to underscore
our words we should take actions and take back some of the insurance we have put on in the
context of elevated downside tail risks
given recent economic developments and the improvement in financial market
functioning coupled with our accommodative stance of policy it seems pretty clear to me that if
the economy continues to evolve as it has over the past couple of months we should move to
raise the funds rate  this is also the view of market participants whose expectations for policy
have steepened considerably over the intermeeting period  my forecast therefore incorporates a
monetary policy path that is steeper than the one in the greenbook  i assume that the funds rate
will reach 275 percent by the end of 2008 and move up to 45 percent by the end of 2009  this
steeper funds rate path is necessary in my view to deliver inflation that is declining back toward
our goal
regarding the suggestion by the subcommittee on communications on lengthening the
forecast period i think it can be a very useful device and i support it  my preference however
is for option 2 although i think option 1 could work just as well  im for option 2 partly because
i too am less confident about forecasting whatever the dynamic adjustment process happens to
be and so just going to year 5 i think would be useful  omitting year 4 is not omitting any
information that is terribly informative as far as i am concerned  i am a little reluctant to go to
some longerterm average like fivetoten years because i think that muddles the communication
picture and may signal a weakening of our commitment about the timeframe over which we
think we can really achieve some objective  so i am most comfortable with option 2 or i could
be happy with option 1 as well  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  economic activity in the fifth district has
remained soft in recent weeks  our retailers report declining activity in june especially in autos
we are still hearing scattered reports of delayed or canceled new construction projects either
because of a lack of financing or because demand is expected to decline  our survey measure of
manufacturing activity which by the way covers a manufacturing sector bigger than the
philadelphia and the empire indexes combined laughter has edged lower in the last two
months but exports continue to be a bright spot with reports of robust outbound activity at area
ports  manufacturing contacts report some success in passing on rising energy and transportation
costs to their customers and their indexes of expected sixmonthahead manufacturing price
trends both for prices paid and prices received reached new record highs for the 14year history
of those series  i too have heard scattered reports in the last couple of weeks of employers
contemplating providing extra compensation boosts to their employees to make up for rising
energy costs
on the whole i think the risk of the national economy sinking into a serious recession
has receded and the growth outlook has edged up a bit  i was relieved by the strength in retail
sales in may as well as the upward revisions for april and march  the ism indexes have
steadied at right around 50 over the past four months and although the labor market has been
weak it has not yet shown the accelerating declines that i feared  the greenbook projection for
q2 real gdp has been revised from minus 14 to plus 17 and we have made a similar
adjustment in our own projection
there remain plenty of reasons for concern on the real side of the economy of course
real disposable income has suffered with the fall in employment over the last halfyear and the
rising cost of gasoline is taking its toll as well  the continued fall in housing prices has cut into
household net worth and could contribute to a rise in consumer saving  stimulus checks might
be playing an important role in supporting consumer spending right now it is not clear how
much  but i am concerned that when the stimulus effects wear off later this year we may find
that the underlying trend in consumer spending is fairly soft  commercial construction also
remains a potential risk i believe  there is a bit of a disconnect between the surprisingly strong
data on nonresidential construction and the reports of slowing that we keep hearing from regional
contacts  this suggests that the numbers reflect projects initiated before the beginning of the
year and that commercial construction is likely to soften later this year and to be a drag next
year  despite all of these elements that could depress growth i think the economic situation has
undoubtedly turned out better than we expected at the april meeting because of the betterthan
expected consumer and businessinvestment numbers  greenbook now forecasts a period of low
but positive real growth significantly better than the experiences of the last two fairly mild
recessions and i think that is about right
inflation is a growing problem though  cpi came in at an annual rate of 8 percent in
may and has averaged 49 percent over the last three months  the core intermediate goods ppi
is increasing at doubledigit rates  oil prices have risen 16 percent by my calculation since the
last meeting  retail gas prices are up 13 percent  changes in inflation expectations since the last
meeting vary with the measure that you choose  but my reading is that they continue to
deteriorate  in any event they are above levels consistent with price stability  the michigan
survey numbers for inflation expectations have risen notably especially for the oneyear horizon
the tipsbased measure of expected oneyear inflation five years forward has increased
30 basis points since the april meeting and although the fiveyear fiveyearforward figure has
been stable since then it is still quite close to the highest value it reached at any point last year
it is popular as many have noted around the table to cite the stability of compensation gains as
evidence that we are not seeing a wageprice spiral  i have done it myself recently  but i share
the concerns expressed by president evans and others around the table about that being a lagging
indicator  i am concerned that if we wait until we see rising inflation expectations showing up
as wage pressures we will have waited too long  i noted in just a casual glance at the data from
the 1970s that although wage acceleration was a prominent component of the acceleration of
inflation in the late 1960s it was largely absent in the accelerations that occurred in 74 and 79
i think monetary policy is quite stimulative right now  using the bluebooks standard
approach of subtracting fourquarter lagged core inflation the real funds rate now stands just
below zero about where it bottomed out in the 91 recession and a good deal above its trough in
2004  but i dont think lagged core inflation is the best estimate of overall inflation now  i am
drawn to the bluebooks real rate estimate new in this edition that uses the greenbooks
projection for headline inflation  using that measure and going back and reconstructing it for the
past the real funds rate is now minus 13 percent and that is substantially lower than its troughs
in the last two recessions which were right around zero  this is a lot of stimulus arguably way
too much given the improvement in the growth outlook the reduction in downside risks and the
continuation of inflation pressures  i think withdrawing the stimulus is going to be challenging
however
about the extended projections i am not convinced that the benefits exceed the cost  i
dont think it is going to provide much help on communicating an inflation objective  i think it
will show about as much dispersion as our thirdyear forecasts show now  in any event i
havent noticed much of a decline in the volatility of inflation expectations since we began
releasing projections on an accelerated calendar late last year  moreover i think those steady
state or longerrun projections are just going to tempt people to think that we have an
unemployment rate target and a growth target  that some politicians have suggested that we
actually adopt such makes it dangerous to engage in any exercise that seems to comply with that
suggestion  besides i am not sure who cares about our steadystate growth forecasts besides
maybe some businesscyclemodel calibrators  but we are likely to get our steadystate growth
forecasts from those people in any event so i am not sure that is going to be very helpful  i
dont think we should bother with these extended forecasts  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a break until 445 and have
some coffee  thank you
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we reconvene  president bullard whenever you
are ready
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  the district economy continues to be
sluggish  severe weather combined with a very wet spring is hampering agriculture in some
areas  major flooding has caused significant damage already and the situation continues to
develop  many business contacts in the district emphasize energy costs along with some other
high commodity prices as an overriding concern  most of the descriptions i have encountered
concern businesses and consumers scrambling to adjust to new pricing realities  many contacts
are reporting skittishness over the inflation outlook fueled by dramatic increases in key
commodity prices  many contacts with deep experience in the commodities markets remain
convinced that market manipulation or speculation is behind the runup in commodity prices
across the board over the past several years  this belief is widespread and deeply held  many
predict a crash in market prices of these commodities once the bubble bursts  my assessment is
that this very strong belief may by itself have important macroeconomic implications
businesses and households may be reacting very differently to price increases that they see as
temporary as opposed to their reaction if they view price increases as permanent and unlikely to
reverse
reports on the level of economic activity are decidedly mixed  the housing sector
remains in a deep slump and subject to a widespread shakeup  business in the energy sector
continues to boom  high energy prices are affecting the logistics business which has to try to be
profitable at higher prices with reduced demand  still a very large retailer reports brisk activity
and a large technology firm is essentially unaffected by the macroeconomic slowdown  recent
data on the us economy have been stronger than forecast keeping economic performance weak
but avoiding a particularly sharp contraction  the worst outcomes stemming from financial
market turmoil have failed to materialize thus far  there is to be sure still some potential for
additional upheaval depending in part on the managerial agility among key financial firms
however the us economy is now much better positioned to handle financial market turmoil
than it was six months ago  this is due to the lending facilities now in place and to the
environment of low interest rates that has been created  renewed financial market turmoil
should it occur during the summer or fall would not now be as worrisome from a systemic risk
perspective  in addition to this lessened risk from financial markets i see the drag from housing
dissipating during the second half of the year  most likely we will also see a moderation in
energy price increases  output growth is therefore likely to be moderately stronger going
forward
policy was very aggressive during january and march of this year  this was in part a
preemptive action insurance against a particularly severe downturn brought on by financial
contagion  this was a very real possibility but it did not materialize  this has created a
situation with more stimulus in train than would have been intended had we known the outcome
in advance  this is putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations in the second
half of this year  policy has to turn now to face this situation
on the longterm projections i think it is a good idea to put down longterm projections
i am happy with any of the options  i have a slight preference for option 3  i think a trial run
would be good  if the objective is to name these numbers such as an inflation target or the
potential growth of the economy another way to do it would just be to name those numbers and
not have it tied to any projection or any particular year  we could just say this is what i think
the inflation objectives should be  this is how fast i think the economy could grow in the
absence of shocks  and this is what i think the unemployment rate would be if output were
growing at potential and inflation were at target  you could just name those numbers  you
wouldnt have to say five years away or ten years away which kind of brings in new longrun
factors that you might not want to get into  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman the last two months have brought an
interesting shift in my conversations with my business contacts  their concerns have shifted
from problems in financial markets to the rapid increase in input prices  energy prices are the
focus nationwide but steel prices are also capturing the attention of the business people in my
district  several manufacturers and builders noted that the price they pay for steel has almost
doubled since the beginning of this year  clearly businesses are worried about signs of growing
price pressures but their reactions to these price shocks tell a more complicated story  many
manufacturers have not been able to pass on price increases resulting in a clear loss to profit
margins  these businesses often report costcontainment or efficiency programs that will affect
their hiring and capital decisions for months to come
interestingly the consumer price data show a similar dichotomy  my staff noted that our
primary measures of core inflation are not providing a consistent story about the path of
underlying inflation  in the may cpi report roughly onethird of the weighted price changes
increased at rates above 5 percent and roughly onethird of prices changed by rates less than
1 percent  for example while energy costs were up strongly and prices for a number of general
service components have been drifting higher large declines in apparel and vehicle expenses are
imparting significant offsets  the 16 percent trimmed mean indicator showed an alarming
4 percent rise in prices while the median rose just at 22 percent  the weight of price changes in
the 1 percent to 5 percent range was unusually small making it difficult to estimate the central
tendency of the price change distribution with much confidence  so this makes it difficult to get
a good read on where future prices are headed
my district business contacts remain pessimistic about growth prospects  district retail
reports focused extensively on the likely effects of gasoline and food prices on the purchasing
decisions of consumers  many manufacturers builders and distributors are facing complicated
output and investment decisions in the context of input price growth and weaker markets
overall most of the business people that i talk with are still quite cautious about their business
plans despite the fact that most of them have found sources of credit and terms that are not too
elevated from what they have seen in previous years
in the economic projections that i submitted for this meeting i raised my nearterm
forecast for output growth slightly and for headline inflation slightly more  over the medium
term my outlook continues to be for modest growth because the housing market in my forecast
recovers slowly actually more slowly than in the greenbook  my staff estimated a model for
national housing starts that takes into account what has happened in the past in states that have
seen major increases in foreclosures  the real estate difficulties that these states faced were
much more persistent than anything that we have yet seen in the national data  the bottom line
of this analysis is that if the patterns of past housing cycles from the states that experienced the
boombust cycles are repeated at the national level then housing starts should remain relatively
weak over the next couple of years  supporting this analysis three of the large regional banking
organizations in my district are increasing their loanloss provisions significantly in the second
quarter based on the continued deterioration in the housing sector  based on current projections
these institutions are projecting housing sector credit losses to accelerate in the second half of
2008 and to continue into 2009  currently the weak output growth contributes to my forecast of
declining inflation rates especially the core rate but i also see evidence supporting that view in
the less worker bargaining power scenario that is in the greenbook  my contacts see very little
price pressures coming from labor costs now or in the near future
finally implicit in my forecast for output growth and inflation is a fed funds rate path
that includes increases later this year and into next year  although additional risks to growth
remain the primary risk to my forecast concerns input prices and inflation expectations  if
commodity prices continue to accelerate they are going to put upward pressure on both headline
and core inflation and downward pressure on output  that environment could lead to a highly
undesirable increase in inflation expectations  on the positive side of risk to the outlook i think
that the fed funds rate actions that we have taken in conjunction with the actions that we took in
august to bolster market liquidity have improved confidence and i have substantially lowered
the odds i had placed on financial market meltdown and on a severe recession  in that sense
since our meeting in april the downside risks to my outlook for economic growth have lessened
somewhat and the risks to my inflation outlook have moved up somewhat
regarding the issue of providing longerterm forecasts i have long supported efforts to
clarify the underlying objectives of fomc participants by providing our longerterm economic
projections  of the proposals that were offered by the subcommittee on communications i
favor reporting the average values for output growth unemployment and total inflation expected
over a fivetotenyear periodoption 3  the features of these fivetotenyear projections that i
find attractive are that they indicate where the economy might converge and dont imply too
much knowledge of the path to the long run  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  most of my contacts continued to report
sluggish domestic demand and they are not currently seeing any improvement in activity  in
addition their comments often focused on the substantially higher costs that they are facing for a
wide range of nonlabor inputs  with regard to business activity much of what we heard about
the district and the national economy was a rehashing of preexisting developments  at our last
meeting we felt that there was substantial risk of a further softening in secondquarter growth so
the absence of new news is a positive development  with regard to specific sectors exporters i
have talked with continue to thrive and steel producers are doing quite well  but any business
associated with housing markets is very weak and the motor vehicle outlook continues to
worsen  all detroit three ceos are expecting light vehicle sales to be less than 15 million units
in 2008
the seventh district has experienced substantial flooding in recent weeks particularly in
iowa  we have been in contact with state officials and numerous businesses  the corn and
soybean crops have experienced significant losses though the range of estimates is wide  higher
estimates for lost corn output in iowa are about 10 percent  that substantial loss would represent
a national crop loss of just about 2 percent  in addition although there have been transportation
disruptions especially on the mississippi our contacts expect these to be shortlived  so overall
our sense is that the economic damage seems to be relatively contained especially in comparison
with the floods in 1993 which hit a much wider geographic area and affected activity for a
longer period of time
turning to the national picture the incoming data regarding growth generally have been
positive  indeed the string of upward quarterly forecast revisions continues  in particular i
have been impressed by how much secondquarter gdp growth forecasts have moved up  this
is not to say that we are out of the woods  clearly the continued difficulties in the housing and
credit markets as well as the unrelenting increases in energy prices pose important downside
risks to activity  our chicago fed national activity index continues to be in territory i would
characterize as a recessionthe threemonth moving average is minus 108 this past month
still the risk of the adverse feedback loop that concerned us so much clearly seems less likely
today  importantly the financial situation seems better  though conditions are still far from
normal institutions have had time to cope with bad portfolios much as president bullard
mentioned  they have made significant progress in raising capital and have increased provisions
against losses  i think our lending facilities have helped financial institutions gain time to
facilitate the adjustment process  it seems well beyond our abilities however to engineer a
return to normal financial conditions given the extent of financial losses and overbuilding in
housing  with regard to our economic projections we expect growth this quarter to be similar to
the greenbook but unlike the greenbook we are looking for the momentum to carry forward to
a better second half of the year  beyond this year we think growth will run near potential  this
is based on a fed funds rate path close to that in the futures markets  we are assuming a fed
funds rate of 2 percent by the fourth quarter and 3 percent by the end of 2009
turning to inflation a number of factors present a concern for inflation expectations and
our ability to bring inflation down  as i mentioned my contacts spent a good deal of time
talking about materials cost pressures and many around the table have talked about those as
well  many manufacturers were citing large increases in energy and most commodity prices and
everyone was passing along some portion of these cost increases  i have one anecdote on this
in retail cratebarrel reported on recent buyers trips to asia saying that prices for items
purchased there would be 15 to 20 percent higher for next year  finally wage pressures have
been subdued thus far  still econometric analysis by my staff reminded me that wage inflation
tends to follow price inflation not the other way around  so by the time we see wage pressures
either we are not behind the curve now or it is katie bar the door  it is probably one or the
other  laughter  indeed i am concerned that large and persistent changes in costs and in
relative prices of highprofile items such as energy could change the inflationary mindset of
businesses and households  the resulting increase in inflation expectations would pose a
difficult challenge for monetary policy  maybe it will end up being okay maybe surveys will be
right  but it is a big risk and that risk is a bit large for my comfort
looking ahead we all see the substantial upside risk to price stability posed by the pass
through of higher costs and any possible increase in inflation expectations  while i hope i am
wrong i feel that we may need to accept a somewhat longer period of resource slack than we
would like in order to address these risks and put inflation more firmly on a downward
trajectory  under our projection for gdp growth the economy does not close the modest
resource gaps we project will be in place at the end of 2008 until beyond the forecast horizon
along with a flattening in energy and other commodity prices such gaps should be sufficient to
contain inflation expectations and bring overall pce inflation near 2 percent in 2009 and 2010
that is our expectation  but my base case does not have inflation moving below 2 percent until
after 2010 and that is even with more aggressive policy tightening than the greenbook path
now turning to the longterm projections i think that our forecasts for 2010or at least
the way that i think about itdo suffer from some difficulties  we would like to mention in the
writeup that at the end of the period the range is between 1 percent and 2 percent and we can
infer policymakers preferences from that  that is one interpretation  given the inflationary
pressures that is harder and harder for many people to come up with  i think in some cases it
requires a monetary policy response that is beyond what most people would expect that we could
actually do  so i dont try to force my inflation forecast into my preferred range if it is too hard
based upon monetary policy it is more medium term  so i do tend to favor a longer period  i
am somewhat indifferent between the first and the second options  i dont really see a lot of
difference but something that has a fiveyear forecast i think is useful  whether or not it has the
fourth year and whether or not it is core pce or total are less important issues
one argument for this is an interesting body of research which i have been exposed to
only at conferencesand jim probably knows it better than moston learning and whether
individuals in the economy can learn these rules without a variety of information  some of the
better papers that i have seen on that remind us that you need more pieces of information than
just what the target is whether it be 1 percent or 2 percent  you need some type of contour
when people are learning with simplistic learning rules like least squares learning  so i think a
bit more contour on the forecast would be helpful  in my mind that pushes you toward the five
years of forecasting as opposed to a steady state or a fivetotenyear forecast  i think thats an
important element  on the trial run i think we could do it sooner than that but i know a lot of
staff resources are involved  so i favor sooner rather than later  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well like some othersmaybe many othersi
too have raised my forecast for growth for this year basically just extending whats happening in
the first half of the year and ive raised my projection for growth next year marginally as well
still i must admit to some significant reservations about doing that  as i look at the outlook and as
larry slifman pointed out there are a number of weaknesses concerns or downsides that you can
pretty readily identifytight or tightening credit conditions a still significant decline in housing
activity a decline in housing values and the negative wealth effects associated with that the runup
in energy prices and so forth  many of those will adversely affect the consumer it seems to me
when we have that high a number of what i would call identifiable negatives i wouldnt be
surprised if we had one or more quarters of significant economic contraction still ahead of us despite
the recent relatively good news on the growth side
at the same time the news on inflation hasnt been particularly positive from my
perspective and thats particularly true if the greenbook is right and some of the relatively
favorable recent readings on core inflation are likely to prove transitory  im struck by the volume
of questions i get and concerns expressed about inflation when im out talking with business groups
or giving a speech to a more general audience  now a lot of this of course is focused on or stems
from whats happening to energy prices and food prices which are highly visible and which people
experience directly and frequently  nevertheless im concerned that all of that makes inflation
expectations a bit more vulnerable maybe more than a bit more vulnerable than they have been to
this point
my reading of inflation expectations per se is that they at least the longerterm
expectationsand im relying mostly on the tips data herehave been remarkably well anchored
so far  perhaps a partial explanation for that is that core inflation really hasnt moved much since
200304  thats a bit of a doubleedged sword because it has locked in a bit higher than i might
have preferred  nevertheless stability that has been maintained is there  perhaps it goes some
distance to explain our continuing or what appears to be our continuing credibility on that issue
now the greenbook does have some inching up of core inflation from here  if theyre right and
thats all we get then i would be surprised if that led to a real deterioration in inflation expectations
but that may prove to be a big if
as far as extending the projections goes im in favor of doing that  i dont think there will
be a huge payoff but i think it will provide some additional information to us internally and to the
public  i dont have a strong preference about which alternative we go with  maybe the trial run
will point out some advantages or disadvantages that we didnt anticipate  at the moment if i had
to vote id probably vote for the second alternative which would be to split the difference put
down the fifth year and let it go at that
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i think we face an extended
period of relatively weak economic growth quite weak domestic demand growth and overall
growth significantly below trend  i think this is both likely and necessary  its likely because we
have more weakness ahead as the housing drag continues financial headwinds remain acute the
economy adjusts to the very large and sustained energy price shock the saving rate increases and
global demand moderates  its necessary to achieve a reasonable inflation outcome over the
forecast period
our central projection has the us economy growing though at a rate significantly below
potential and then recovering gradually toward trend over the next year  this is our modal forecast
and in this forecast the economy just skirts a recession  the output gap begins to narrow over the
forecast period  housing prices begin to stabilize only late in 09 after a cumulative peaktotrough
drop of roughly 12 percent using the ofheo repeat sales purchaseonly index  net exports
provide a significant though fading boost to gdp growth this year and next  we project a very
gradual very modest moderation in core inflation over the forecast period  of course this forecast
depends on a lot of things happening  it depends on expectations remaining reasonably well
contained energy and commodity prices following the futures curve the dollar only modestly
weaker somewhat diminished pressure on resource utilization here and around the world and
continued moderate growth in compensation and unit labor costs  our policy assumption builds in
significant tighteninga significant move up in the fed funds rate over the forecast periodthough
not as soon as the market now expects
the uncertainty around and risks to this central projection are substantial  on the growth
front although we believe the risks of a very deep prolonged economic downturn have
diminishednot on their own but because of the force of the policy response so farwe still think
the risks are weighted significantly to the downside  the main risks remain  the ongoing stress on
financial markets the risk that this further restricts the supply of credit exacerbates financial
conditions pushes home prices and other equity prices down more further tightening credit
conditions et cetera a steeperthanexpected rise in the saving rate and the adjustment to the
ongoing drag from energy prices
on the inflation front wei think like the rest of yousee the risks ahead tilted somewhat
to the upside for many obvious reasons  i think its true that looked at together the mix of
measures of inflation expectations suggests that private agents may have less confidence in the
fomcs commitment to price stability than they did in previous periods when total inflation was
running significantly above core  so this is going to be a very challenging period for policy  its
not all terrible  productivity growth is a little higher than we thought  underlying inflation and
longterm inflation expectations certainly could already have been showing signs of a more
compelling immediate danger  spending has been somewhat stronger than confidence measures
would have suggested  the current account balance has narrowed significantly  we are seeing very
substantial changes in behavior across the us economy in the consumption of energy  so there are
good things to point to  but in the two dangerous areasin the financial sector and in the global
inflation environmenti think things are materially worse than at our last meeting
again the risk of inflation is readily apparent  apart from the numbers i agree with many
of you who said that the alarm and concern is materially higher and materially different today across
a broad range of firms in different industries than it was even as recently as two months ago  we
have to be worried about intensified pressure on compensation growth even with the degree of slack
that we now see in the labor market  although firms are absorbing in margins a significant part of
the increase in unit costsand a lot of the complaining that we hear is about margins that are
coming down and those that are expected to come downi do think that firms are demonstrably
able to pass on more than they would have been before  of course what makes it very hard for us is
that the pressure on resources is coming largely from outside the united states and the other major
economies from countries that are growing significantly above trend with central banks that are not
independent and are running very expansionary monetary policies  i think we are really seeing an
alarming acceleration in inflation rates in large parts of the world for the first time in a couple of
decades  if these countries do not tighten monetary policy sufficiently and reduce energy price
subsidies materially then we will have to be tighter than we otherwise would have to be
in the financial world although i think its true that the market believes there has been some
significant reduction in the risk of an acute systemic financial crisis i think we have a long period of
acute fragility ahead  were in the midst right now of more material erosion in sentiment spreads
asset prices balance sheet pressures and liquidity in some markets  overall financial conditions are
probably somewhat tighter than when we last met  the financial headwinds have intensified again
and they are likely to remain intense for some time
again i think this is going to be a very challenging road ahead  it is important to recognize
that the current stance of policy embodies not just the fed funds rate today relative to our best
measure of equilibrium but also the expectations about policy that are now built into the treasury
curve  that policy today does not look that accommodative  if you look at the bluebook charts and
at a range of measures of real fed funds rates today relative to different measures of equilibrium
policy is less accommodative just on that simple measure than it was at the most accommodative
point of the last two downturns  that said were going to have to tighten monetary policy and the
question is when  my sense is soon but not yet  right now we still face a very delicate very fine
balance and have to be careful not to declare victory prematurely on the growth front or on the
financial front  i think its going to be hard for us to do that until we see that we are closer to the
point at which we can confidently say that we start to see the bottom in housing prices  also we
have to be careful not to raise expectations too much that were on the verge of an imminent
significant tightening in policy  it is a difficult balance  we should take some comfort from the fact
that the market believes we will do enough soon enough to keep those expectations down
on the projections front i have a complicated view mr chairman  i apologize  if we are
going to change we should focus on stuff that will change things significantly  i dont see huge
gains from the changes in these options to our current communication regime  if were going to
change a trial run in the fall is fine  but i think the fall is too soon to change  we need to get
through this thing  we have a very challenging period with a lot of stuff going on and i think we
need to use every molecule of oxygen in the system to get through this mess  i dont think this
projections change materially helps the communication challenge in getting through this mess and
may complicate it in some ways
if we are going to do something beyond our current regime i would favor doing something
slightly different from this  i would favor at least considering publishing the average of our
individual views on what the desirable longrun rate of inflation is an average of our judgments of
what trend growth is today and maybe what the natural rate of unemployment is today  we know
very little about what those latter variablestrend growth and the natural rate of unemployment
are five to ten years ahead  it is very hard for us individually to put much confidence on whatever
the path is toward that point  our current regime for aggregating our forecasts the way we do
tossing out the individuals makes our basic forecast not particularly useful as a prism  so i would
focus on doing something slightly different to change the regime and i wouldnt do it this soon  if
were going to change lets debate the big things and not spend too much time on things at the
margin which fundamentally arent going to offer too much promise relative to the level of
ignorance we have or relative to the complexity that people face in reading any particular
meaningful value in the aggregation of our forecasts the way we now do them
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  my forecasts for both economic growth and
inflation are within the central tendency of the rest of you and a little stronger than the staffs
outlook  in fact my 2008 projections for economic activity for the second half of the year were
revised very little from two months ago  growth turned out to be stronger than i expected in the
first half and that carries some weight going forward but financial conditions are tighter with
higher bond rates and lower equity prices and of course oil prices are a lot higher and that will
damp demand going forward  so i expect slow growth in the second half followed by expansion
around maybe a little above the rate of growth of potential in 09 and 10 with the same basic
story that everybody else has  drags on activity from declining housing activity decreasing wealth
tight credit conditions and higher petroleum prices  all of those drags will abate over time
allowing the natural resilience with slightly accommodative financial conditions to show through
and i assume a gradual tightening of monetary policy beginning next year
incoming information on prices and costs has been mixed  oil and food price increases will
raise headline inflation but core has been stable and has come in a little to the soft side of
expectations and labor costs as yet show no signs of accelerating  going forward i see a sharp
decline in headline inflation later this year with the assumed levelingout in oil prices and a gradual
decrease in core as economic slack inhibits wage and price increases offsetting the passthrough
from oil prices  now thats my central tendency  i consider the odds on that being realized to be
even lower than usual and the usual odds are disappearingly small  it seems to me that the defining
characteristics of the current situation are uncertainty and risk  were facing multiple shocks many
of them unprecedented in size and persistence in the housing market financial markets and
commodities  the outlook is full of puzzles and in my mind anyone who thinks he or she
understands whats going on is either a lot smarter than i am or delusionalor both  laughter
i class the risks for both output and headline inflation as greater than usual and let me tell
you about some of the things i wrestled with  financial conditions are they accommodative  i
continue to believe that the 2 percent nominal funds rate is not indicative of a highly
accommodative financial condition given the current state of financial markets  that is in my view
we have limited insurance  spreads have widened sufficiently over the past 10 months both for
longterm and shortterm credit and bank terms and conditions for loans and lines of credit have
tightened enough that only a small part of the drop in the fed funds rate is showing through to the
cost of capital for median households and firms  the staffs flow of funds estimates show a marked
deceleration in the growth of both household and business debt in the first half of this year from 10
percent for households last year to 3 percent in the first half of the year and from 12 percent for
businesses to 7 percent in the first half of the year  a 2 percent fed funds rate will become
accommodative as spreads narrow and financial functioning returns more toward normal and thats
one reason i assumed a gradually rising federal funds rate over 2009 and forward
the evidence about improving financial markets over the intermeeting period was decidedly
mixed  some spreads did come in from late april  investmentgrade businesses tapped bond
markets in size but almost all spreads remain unusually wide  we were reminded of the fragility of
the evolving situation especially in the financial sector with the worries about continuing credit
problems resulting in sharp declines in equity prices on financials and an uptick in their cds
spreads which had narrowed the previous month or two the downgrading of monolines and
investment banks and the increasing attention to the problems of regional banks  it would be
surprising if these were not reflected in even greater caution by banks and other lenders in their
lending practices  also the securitization markets especially for nonagency mortgages are not
functioning in a way to replace bank intermediation  this is going to be a prolonged process of re
intermediation deleveraging and building liquidity with an uncertain endpoint  like the staff i
assume that the conditions return to something approaching normal over the next 18 months but the
risks are skewed toward an even longer recovery period
the second topic is household spending  households are facing a huge number of adverse
shocks  higher oil prices tighter credit declining house prices and rising unemployment  its not
surprising that confidence is at recessionary levels  it is surprising that spending is so resilient  i
assumed that the saving rate would rise very gradually once the tax rebate effects wore off but i
think a more abrupt and sizable increase in household saving is a distinct downside risk  what
about housing  some sales measures have shown a few tentative indications of leveling off  i was
encouraged by president lockharts report from florida but im also struck by renewed pessimism
about housing in the financial markets  equities of construction firms and builders have declined
after stabilizing actually rising earlier this year  abx indexes have turned down reversing earlier
improvements and perhaps underlying the previous two developments the caseshiller futures
indexes remain in steep decline though todays information was less weak than expected  the view
of the financial markets anyhow is that the light at the end of the housing tunnel is receding and
declines in expected house prices must be an important reason for the erosion in market confidence
in financial intermediaries
in sum although the incoming data may have reduced the threat of a sharp drop in spending
in my view there remains a very pronounced downward skew around my outlook for modest growth
in h2 and a strengthening next year  however that downward skew around output did not translate
into a downward skew around my forecast for headline inflation  in fact i saw the risks on headline
inflation as tilted to the upside though roughly balanced around the gradual decrease in core  i
think the upside risks result from two additional areas of uncertainty  one area is commodity prices
though the trend increases in commodity prices over the past few years can be attributed to rising
demands from emerging market economies relative to sluggishly responding supplies  despite
nathans best efforts i really dont think we have much of a clue about the cause of the spike in oil
prices this year  it has been especially striking to me over the intermeeting period when the prices
of industrial commodities have been falling on balance  presumably prices in these markets already
incorporate expectations of reasonably strong global growth outside the united states as in the
greenbook  absent any surprises futures market quotes ought to be the best guide but what we
dont understand can fool us especially when so much of the relevant information involves
emerging market economies where data are sparse and of questionable value  given our
experience over the past few years i think continued increases in commodity prices would seem to
be an upside risk
the other area is inflation expectations  i assume that as headline inflation comes down
both short and longterm inflation expectations especially in the survey data will reverse their
recent increases based a lot on the kind of information that president yellen was observing about
how the household survey has tended to follow contemporaneous inflation  im encouraged by the
relatively flat readings on core inflation and labor compensation increases  higher expectations
have not so far become embedded in prices and costs despite all the talk of passing along cost
increases  but headline inflation is going to rise before it falls  real wages will be further eroded
by higher energy costs  although this is a necessary part of an adjustment to an adverse termsof
trade shock it will be resisted  hence a further rise in inflation expectations and a stronger
determination by households and businesses to act on those expectations will be a risk over coming
months  with that further rise in oil prices its a bigger risk than it was a couple of months ago
in terms of the longterm projections mr chairman i think im fine with something like
your proposal  our objective for adding a year was to give the public a better sense of where were
going over the long term  given the shock to the economy thats not as informative as it was
before  i think were close to where most people would say their inflation objective was but not for
the growth rate of potential or the nairu  i could live with option 3 or president bullards
alternative to thatto state exactly what our longterm expectations are instead of talking about five
to seven years or five to ten years  i dont think well gain a lot  i dont think the costs or benefits
are very large on either side of this  our problems now are not that people dont understand where
were going in the end  i think they have a pretty good idea that we want inflation to be a lot lower
than it has been  but i think they dont really understand how were going to get either to full
employment or to price stability given where were starting  so i think the uncertainty about our
objectives is a very small problem relative to the other problems now  but if we can reinforce what
those objectives are it might help a little around the edges  i do worry as president lacker said
that what we say about output and employment not be interpreted as goals but rather as a judgment
about the state and the structure of the economy  i am hopeful that we could take care of that in
what we say about what were publishing  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  at this point everything has been said but
everybody hasnt said it  so let me try  laughter  let me make three summary points and then i
will talk about three issues that i think are harder  first on the economy through late may as the
greenbook suggests the real economy proved more resilient and more dynamic than the consensus
had anticipated  consumer spending was moderate but positive and the labor markets were soft
but neither was necessarily indicative of a recession through late may  business fixed investment
and corporate profits ex financials look all right  productivity growth looks frankly impressive
and corporations unlike consumers still appear okay through the month of junebut im going to
return to june in just a short while  in sum my assessment of the economy reasonably
approximates the average gdp from the greenbook for 2008 but i remain considerably more
cautious on the catalyst for returntotrend growth in the forecast period of 2009 and beyond  i
suspect that this is a long slow climb with the credit channels needing to be rebuilt and that the
process is still in its very early stages
second let me talk about the financial markets  financial markets continue to show tenuous
but real improvements in market functioningwhich as bill dudley suggested is remarkable
given the weakness among financial institutions themselves  leveraged loans and highyield
markets continue to trend toward improved market functioning  credit spreads are well off their
march highs  credit markets in particular are holding up well despite the broad weakness across
equities
third let me turn to inflation risks  inflation risks in my view continue to predominate as
the greater risk to the economy  there is more evidence of a global secular reversal of inflation
trends making the jobs of central bankers worldwide considerably more difficult  i remain worried
about energy and food passthrough and the effect of a weakening dollar if our policy rates and
those of our major trading partners are perceived to diverge  i would expect import prices core
inflation and expectations to move up in the coming months even more than in the greenbook
likely causing a policy response by our foreign peers  commodity prices again with the exception
of metals have been moving up while global demand is falling and markets have come to see this
rise of some if not most commodities as essentially permanent  so at the end of the day we have
to be concerned about this period of aboveacceptable inflation  its crucial that broader prices do
not start to rise at stillfaster rates and that could well happen if those making decisions about prices
and pay expect higher inflation in the future  anecdotes are not comforting particularly on the
price front  as a result i think the trajectory of inflation is less favorable than in the greenbook
thereby necessitating a policy response more significant than the greenbook would suggest
let me turn to three even harder issues  one is consumer spending  were not done with
the second quarter and my sense of whats happened in the first three weeks of june is pretty
miserable  i hate to extrapolate based on three weeks of data to the trajectory of the economy  but
from a discussion with contacts from three credit card companies that constitute a little more than
half of the credit card spend i would say that the views from these guys were shocking in how bad
things looked in the past three to four weeks particularly in comparison to reasonably positive news
from the previous two months  it is suggestive that june will be much weaker than may and if i
add that to the figures on autos that are coming out of the detroit three those are a couple of
anecdotes that make me a little hesitant to declare with an exclamation mark what an enviable
second quarter weve had  i also look at equity market prices sometimes as maybe telling us
something  i would say that consumer companies and retailers over the last three weeks have gotten
killed  so im a little hesitant to suggest that the second quarter is going to be strong
delinquencies and chargeoffs have also moved meaningfully to the downside in the last three or
four weeks among these credit card companies and this weakness appears to be much more focused
on the coasts than it is in the center of the country  i heard that from three of three  my own view
may be influenced by my take on the fiscal stimulusit sure doesnt appear to be helping very
much
the second issue that i continue to struggle with is financial institutions  financial
institution equity prices showed significant underperformance and some people say that is the
federal reserves fault  were talking up our concerns about inflation  were changing the
treasury curve going forward  i think that is a total red herring  the reason that financials are
getting killed is an equity story  they have business models that are having a hard time delivering
profits in this environment  they have had to show a very tough quarterly set of losses  i think the
problems on financials have to do with financials and not with the fed though there is a disturbing
amount of chatter in the markets that somehow were the cause of that  i am comforted again as
bill dudley reminded us that the broader market functioning has been able to withstand this
dramatic financial institution weakness  whether at some point that will give out i dont know but
id say thats extremely encouraging  in addition we have to recognize that massive amounts of
new capital are going to be needed for financial institutions of all sizes  given the weak
performance of virtually every financial investment from november till now i think it is very easy
to see a supplydemand problem  it is very easy to see that with the number of banks that come to
these markets some of them at some point might not be able to find capital even at dramatically
lower prices than their expectations  it is prudent for us at the fed to think about alternative sources
of morepatient institutional funding during this period
the third issue for discussion is credit availability especially for small businesses  this
strikes me as being key to the labor market situation  credit availability for small businesses has
held up better than i would have expected four or five months ago but pockets of weakness remain
particularly among the regional banks which are a source of concern  i guess ive become
convinced that credit lines have not been tapped out  there was a theory one that i even had some
sympathy toward that increases in ci lending in the last few quarters were involuntary reflecting
existing credit lines that were called upon  that strikes me as being somewhat overstated
according to anecdotes and our own survey of the terms of business lending it does suggest that
capital is still available for these small businesses to provide some strength to the economy but
again continued weakness among the regionals could call that into question
let me turn finally mr chairman to the projections  i have some sympathy for the view
that vice chairman geithner put forth  it strikes me that at this time the markets will see the
benefits of changing our communication strategy as yet again pretty small  the costs are harder
for me to be certain about  so if anyone is proposing to do this during the next six months i would
have real hesitancy about introducing this variable into our communication strategy amid our
assessment of all the other challenges that we have  so i favor having a trial run come october but
i think we should revisit where we stand on the inflation front the financial institution front and the
growth front before adding this to the mix  to the extent that we find the appropriate time to go
down this path i would favor option 3  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thanks a lot  well as ive mentioned many times before i have
thought about this as sort of a long slow burn scenario and as we well know the embers are still
smoldering  it seems to be less of a risk that they could reignite causing a major conflagration but
there is still some chance of reignition and i think theres still a fair amount of heat  consistent
with that my central tendency view is probably closer to the greenbooks delayed credit recovery
alternative scenario than to the main greenbook forecast  in looking at the alternative scenario
theres not much of a real effect on growth but that response is due to a lower fed funds path
given the discussions that weve had i think it may be very difficult to pursue something like that
in this environment particularly given higher uncertainty about inflation and inflation expectations
even if as a number of people have mentioned inflation expectations havent moved up that much
or you pick your favorite measure and some have moved up more than others  given that its likely
that we had some transitory factors keeping core and headline inflation down a little lower than they
otherwise might have been and they probably are going to go up i think that dealing with the
delayed credit recovery alternative scenario in the way thats discussed in the greenbook makes
our policy choices particularly difficult
so let me focus briefly on why i think the delayed credit recovery or slow burn scenario is a
reasonable central tendency one  i think it relates largely to our continuing challenges on banks
balance sheets liquidity and capital  banks are facing very high shortterm financing costs  those
liborois spreads are still at extremely elevated levels compared with what theyre used to in
funding themselves and this is true whether they are commercial banks or investment banks  the
forwards suggest that this aint going away anytime soon  so one thing that this does is simply to
cut into profitability and the ability to earn your way out of the challenges  an easy way to do it
of just allowing the machine to go forwardis going to produce less than it otherwise would  a lot
of institutions rely on the federal home loan banks but those are largely tapped out as another
source of financing  we know that the monoline issue has sort of come back and the challenges
there are great  it is undoubtedly going to be leading to a lot more writedowns over the next couple
of quarters  on the other hand as president lockhart governor warsh and some others have
mentioned there have been a few areas that seem to have opened up  the leveragedloan market
seems to have opened up a bit  people seem to be getting those leveraged loans off their books
and not even at effectively subsidized financing rates  they were proud of getting these off their
books before but they were doing it by basically just making another loan which effectively
doesnt get them off the books  now it seems as though they are legitimately able to move this and
obviously that book is not growing  that book is shrinking
of course one of the biggest challenges is in housing and i see the shocks of some of the
resets from the nontraditional mortgages continuing through 09  were seeing very significant
increases in delinquencies and foreclosures not only in the subprime space but also in the adjustable
rate space generallythats both subprime and prime although the levels for prime are dramatically
lower  the increases are quite significant for prime arms and that starts to raise some challenges
for the institutions that didnt do subprime but may still have a reasonable amount of prime arms
on their books  helocs have been mentioned and the inability to securitize anything thats
nonconforming  weve seen very little benefit yet from the changes that allow freddie mac and
fannie mae to raise those limits  also as many of you know from my visits around the country to
your districts i see that conditions in different areas are dramatically different but in general a lot
of markets remain in very difficult circumstances  one of the largest mortgage lenders in the
country said that over the last couple of months their average fico score on what theyve been
originating outside the conforming market has been 800  thats astonishingly highso that gets
back to president yellens comment about even with fico scores in the stratosphereand they
claim thats an average fico score and they have been pulling back on the helocs et cetera
on rising delinquency rates for credit cards i didnt hear quite as bleak a view as governor
warsh described  i wouldnt want to say a positive view  they seemed to say that it is where they
would have expected it to be in this part of a cycle with increasing delinquencies  one thing that
they were seeing was a little increase in payments and so that may be one of the consequences of
the stimulus check comingthat people are using it to pay down some of their credit card debt  but
a big challenge that they have been seeing is the socalled roll ratesthat once someone begins to
go delinquent they tend to roll right to full loss rather than getting some recovery  it suggests that
when people get into trouble they are in fairly deep trouble  all of this means that the demand for
capital is going to be very high going forward at these institutions as provisioning has to go up  you
know weve tapped sovereign wealth funds institutional investors and a lot of others  as
governor warsh said tapping other sources encouraging perhaps private equity to come in is
something thats important  but how long are these guys willing to invest when over the past nine
months every single investment has seen a reduction rather than an increase in value  im
borrowing a prop from president fisherwe have been going around and saying raise capital
youre worth it  laughter  i hope the investment banks are going around to their shareholders
and saying that also  so far theres not a lot of evidence that they have been  i think in the long run
they will but we have to worry about that
this slow burn scenario is even more problematic in the context of what vice chairman
geithner mentioned about some slowing of foreign demand that i think may be coming and in the
context of a fair amount of increases in interest rates that may be coming in a lot of these countries
youre going to be seeing some credit tightening globally as i think a number of people have
mentioned  it is more likely unless theres a major shock to be more on the tightening side going
forward  this makes it more difficult to deal with some of the issues in the higher inflation
expectations alternative scenario that was in the greenbook because when you have this financial
fragility its harder perhaps to raise interest rates as quickly or as much as you would like because
of the concerns about what might happen in the financial markets
on inflation i think much like president stern and a number of othersit depends on which
particular series you look at  it is hard to say that things have really become unmoored but i think
theres a lot more uncertainty in the minds of both the public and the market participants about
where inflation may go  thats particularly problematic when you have the likely increase in the
actual numbers coming that the greenbook is forecasting for the next quarter or so and in that
context dealing with some of the challenges is more difficult  but well talk about that more
tomorrow
on the projections i think it is important that we continue to increase transparency over
time  we structured what we did last time to make it part of a process and i think it makes sense to
periodically revisit whether we want to continue on that road  i very much prefer a gradualist
approach in principle to add year 5 or soas the chairman saidbut i think theres a bit of a
problem in doing that because too much meaning may be attributed to it  it may be too difficult to
avoid saying well were just doing a target  if we add year 4 and year 5 even though theres not
a lot of information content in year 4 i think it helps to reduce the kind of shock value of seeing that
fifth year out there  now thats potentially a negative because in some sense we want to provide
more information that way  but given the fragile conditions as vice chairman geithner
mentioned i dont think that we want to generate a debate on inflation targets employment targets
and other things like that particularly right now  so maybe having a gradualist approach by which
we just extend things to year 4 and year 5 which is seen as a natural outgrowth wouldnt be as
much of a shock  not that i think it would be shocking but i think it might raise as many concerns
and as much of a debate and distract us from the key issues that we have before us  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  well we have seen recent data that actually
have been stronger than expected  also as time goes on there seems to be a lower probability of
financial meltdown and these adverse feedback loops that weve all been discussing  but i dont
think we want to become too sanguine about the current data because some very negative things are
going on that might tell us that this is just very temporary stuff  in particular its really remarkable
how weak consumer sentiment is  there is also a huge hit from energy prices and its going to get
worse  one thing in the greenbook is that the very low margins that weve had in refining are
going to increase so were going to see gasoline prices that are well over 500 a gallon according
to the kind of numbers youre coming out with and that is going to be a major contractionary hit to
household spending  luckily i dont drive much anymoreim down to less than 600 miles a year
right nowso maybe that is okay but unfortunately ill get back to driving more in the future
in any case i do think that what the greenbook has done is reasonable in terms of changing
the forecast  they have a stronger first half but the longerrun forecast particularly regarding the
output gap is really not very different and i think thats a reasonable forecast  my baseline is
somewhat less optimistic because i feel that the delayed credit recovery alternative scenario was
actually a nice one to put in this greenbook and i was glad to see it because it is very close to the
way i am thinking about the situation right now  i think theres going to be a much slower recovery
of financial markets than was in the greenbook baseline because two things have to occur for us to
get back to normal underwriting  this of course doesnt mean what we had before which did not
have serious enough underwriting standards but something we think is realistic given the kinds of
risks in the economy  financial institutions have to have enough capital just to make loansso
theres the direct effect that we think about  but also the securitization market is clearly very
impaired  eventually it will come back but it will need new business models to solve the agency
issues that have led to all of the heartache that weve seen recently  when i think about how that is
going to happen i think the large financial institutions have to play a key role because you need
somebody who will originate these loans and then will have the incentives to make sure that the
agency problems are not severe  only when thats done can they be sold off and that requires that
there is recourse which requires that they have plenty of capital  of course it is a very slow
process for them to build up capital in the current environment  so given that situation i think the
idea that the financial markets will be back to normal over the next year or two is a little optimistic
its going to take a long time for this to get worked out  so the bottomline scenario is one in which
were going to have strong headwinds for quite a time and thats going to be important in terms of
our monetary policy stance
when i think about inflation as you know i put a lot of emphasis on longrun inflation
expectations and on expectations about future economic slack in the economy  at this point i do
not see a major change and deterioration in longrun inflation expectations  ill explain that in a
second  i should emphasize that i say that is true so far  but an issue is whether that will change
and thats going to be very important in terms of how we manage monetary policy  the first things
i look at when i think about longrun inflation expectations are of course the surveys of consumers
as you know ive always been a little skeptical of them but i think that my views are very similar
to the ones that president yellen mentioned  i have a slightly different explanation using behavioral
economics  behavioral economics tells you that surveys will rise a lot with what happens currently
and overreact and thats exactly what should happen because its a framing issue  you see very
high headline inflation  youre going to raise expectations of inflation one year out  but its very
natural that youre going to raise them for the longer term and theyll come back down when
headline inflation comes down  so i really am not as concerned about the survey expectations
being a longrun problem as long as inflation comes back down  i think there are good indications
that it will given that headline is so much higher than core and that core has actually stayed very
stable
the other things that i look at and look at much more seriously are the surveys of
professional forecasters which have basically moved up a bit but not very much and have not
gotten much out of the range in which they have been in the past and then information from
financial markets that is inflation compensation  again that has not risen recently and actually
its better than it was at its peak  so i dont see a huge problem there  what this tells me about the
inflation forecast isyou know im a 2 percent kind of guy on pce and im still a 2 percent
guythat even though headline inflation is very elevated were going to see over the forecast
period that inflation will come back down to around the 2 percent level both on the headline and on
the core  however though my baseline on this is that inflation will return to a level that by the
way i am comfortable with as an inflation objective i do very much worry that inflation
expectations could be more fragile in the current environment  so its not that i think we have to do
something now  but we do have to be extremely vigilant to see whether inflation expectations are
actually starting to move in an undesirable direction and if so we will have to take action  the
challenge may be that we have to take action when unemployment is still rising but what is key is
that we have to be aware of that  my modal forecast is that it isnt going to happen but i think we
have to be ready to deal with it and deal with it quickly  as you  know im not a believer in
gradualism in circumstances such as we are in currently and i think this applies to dealing not only
with financial disruptions but also currently with inflation expectations  we have to be willing to
move very quickly in that context
let me turn to the issue of longterm projections  you will not be very surprised to know
that in fact im a supporter of this  this committee has actually been well served  even though it
is not my normal personalityas you know i like to move fast on thingswe have moved in an
evolutionary process in terms of communications and i think that has worked quite well for us
this is just an obvious next step  our communication strategy in terms of the longrun projections
now has an important flaw in that we are not providing the information that we intended to provide
and it needs a fix  we now realize that thats the case  its particularly relevant concerning
information about potential output growth and the nairu  i do share the concerns that president
lacker mentioned on these and i have talked about this in many speeches  i think this can be
handled by speechesin particular by the chairman emphasizing these issues going forward  so i
dont see it as a huge problem but it is something that we have to deal with
in any case we need to clarify what our projections mean  were not providing information
that we should  we have to fix it and theres no reason not to  i think its a minor change  i do not
think that there will be much reaction by the markets or in the political sphere on this  i agree
completely with governor kohn that relative to the other problems that we are dealing with this is
very small potatoes but i think it is good to show that were still sticking to the basic things that we
need to stick to and that in this very complex environment we can do the things that need to be
done on communication strategy  that argues that we should be doing this and even doing it right
now  regarding the issues that you raised about going more to the full monty on this kind of stuff i
do agree with vice chairman geithner that now is not the time to do that  i should mention that i
will be giving a speech in which i will be advocating going to an explicit inflation objective but
thats because im leaving the board and i have to say what i think  but theres an issue in terms of
what this committee should be doing and i am sympathetic to vice chairman geithners view that
this is not what we should be doing for the committee right now  on the other hand im a free
individual now  in going back to be a civilian i can say what i want
in terms of my preferences i really dont feel strongly  there are a lot of issues here  when
i first thought about it i preferred an option like 3 because i didnt want to give the impression that
were great at forecasting five years out and i think thats really the strongest argument for it  but i
do understand how we articulate that is a little tricky and i think thats something that we have to
think about  it might be clearer to do something along the lines that president bullard discussed as
arguing it that way but maybe we can do it in some other way  i think thats exactly why the staff
can have some extra work for themselves to think about the best way to describe this but i think
something along the lines of providing information that we actually are putting in our projections
right now where we have a little section that says what are your longterm assumptions and we
put them down  somehow we need to convey that information to the public  then the question is
whats the best way to do that  you can have all the wonderful arguments that we have over the
statement each period  well get something like that going and i think well figure it out  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you and thank you all  first on the longterm
projections i think theres consensus that we should just go ahead and have a trial run  the staff
should review the transcript and make gold out of straw there  we should consult with the
subcommittee and we should think about maybe even a couple of alternatives  maybe we could try
a couple of alternative ways of doing it in october  so lets go ahead and do something along those
lines and keep thinking about how best to do it
let me first as i usually do try to summarize the discussion around the table and ill add
some comments of my own  beginning with the summary the incoming data were stronger than
expected notably for consumer spending but for some other components as well  as a result
economic growth in the second quarter though not robust was likely positive continuing the
pattern of weak but positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2007  however to the extent that
strength in consumption was transitory or due primarily to fiscal stimulus some of the growth in the
second quarter may have been borrowed from the second half  participants generally saw growth
continuing at a slow pace the rest of the year and improving in 2009  there was however some
divergence of views with some expecting a longer period of slow growth
recent numbers on retail sales suggest that the consumer is holding up better than expected
consumer finances may be better than feared and the fiscal stimulus may already be having an
effect  however as many have noted there are substantial drags on consumption going forward
including falling wealth and income credit constraints and the recent rise in energy prices
sentiment has also fallen noticeably further  weaker consumption may thus restrain growth later
this year particularly after the effect of the stimulus wanes  labor markets continue to soften but at
a relatively moderate pace  the peak in unemployment is projected to be between 5 percent and 6
percent  thats what i generally heard around the table  prospects for housing continue weak with
falling prices high inventories and weak demand  some saw a possible bottom forming but noted
that the recovery of this sector is still some way off  as has been the case for a while businesses are
quite cautious noting economic uncertainties and surging input costs with one or two mentions of
tighter credit although that was not a dominant theme today  real exports continue to grow and are
partially offsetting weaker domestic demand especially in the case of manufacturing
financial conditions have been mixed since the last meeting although the improvements
from march have largely been maintained and the risk of systemic crisis may have receded to some
degree  funding markets are generally doing better  the concerns about credit losses have led the
stock prices of banks including regional banks and investment banks to fall sharply  capital
raising continues though at less favorable terms and with perhaps declining availability  as the
economy continues weak and housing contracts further more credit losses for banks may well be in
store adding to financial market stress and reducing the availability of new credit  progress in the
financial markets is likely to be slow as the deleveraging process will take a while  stock prices in
general are also lower  financial conditions in the housing market remain important downside risks
to growth with the spurt in oil prices adding to those risks  uncertainties about the growth
prospects are great  however tail risks may have moderated somewhat
readings on core inflation have remained relatively moderate  however the sharp rise in
oil prices and some other commodity prices in part reflecting flooding in the midwest is likely to
lead to very high levels of headline inflation over the next few months  gas and food prices have
become perhaps the most important economic issue for consumers and firms are feeling ever
increasing cost pressures  moreover inflation pressures are global  there are increasing reports of
firms being able to pass through these costs which could lead to an increase in core inflation  on
the other hand slack may restrain core inflation increases  measures of longerterm inflation
expectations have been up a bit on net since april depending to some extent on the measure
chosen  nominal wage growth is still slowing  participants debated how much comfort to take
from slow wage growth some arguing that by the time wages reflected higher inflation
expectations it would be too late  most saw inflation risks as now to the upside with the primary
concern being the possibility that inflation expectations could rise further as headline inflation rises
and more costs are passed through  thats my very very quick summary  if anyone has any
comments id be happy to hear them
if not let me just say a couple of words on my own views here  this may come as a
surprise to some of you but i am not a finetuner  i think that the objective of the federal reserve
ought to be to avoid a very bad outcome and so my concerns are primarily with tail risks on both
sides of our mandate  i think that the evidence of the last month or so provides a bit of reassurance
on both the real side and the financial side that the tail risks on the growth side of the mandate have
moderated somewhat  that being said i think they remain and are still significant  in particular as
i mentioned in the summary i am at this point still suspicious of the strength that we saw in the
second quarter  if we look at the fundamentals for consumptionincluding wealth income
employment and energy pricesand look at the plunge in sentiment which is at remarkably low
levels i think theres a very good chance that consumers will weaken going forward and bring the
rest of the economy along with them  in addition of course housing remains extremely uncertain
we are at best some distance from stabilization in that market  even when residential construction
begins to stabilize well still see continuing declines in house prices which will affect consumer
spending and importantly will affect financial markets as well as the value of mortgages
with respect to financial markets i agree certainly that the crisis atmosphere that we saw in
march has receded markedly but i do not yet rule out the possibility of a systemic event  we saw
in the intermeeting period that we have considerable concerns about lehman brothers for example
we watched with some concern the consummation of the bank of americacountrywide merger
we worried about a bank in the midwest  other regional banks are under various kinds of stress
were seeing problems with the financial guarantors with the mortgage insurers  so i think that
those kinds of risk are still there and we need to be very careful in observing them  moreover even
if systemic risks have faded we still have the eyeofthestorm phenomenonwe may now be
between the period of the writedowns of the subprime loans and the period in which the credit loss
associated with the slowdown in the economy begins to hit in a big way and we see severe problems
at banks particularly contractions in credit extension
so im not yet persuaded that the tail risks are gone  i think it would be very valuable to
have some more data some more observations to see how the financial markets and the economy
are proceeding  but i want to say that i do agree that the developments in financial markets and the
surprisingly strong data in the second quarter should lead us to feel somewhat better  i think we
should take a little credit for our various efforts to support both the financial system and the
economy
now what about tail risks on the other sideon inflation  the increase in oil prices that
weve seen in the past six weeks is obviously very very bad news  i think that the combination of
the commodity price increases and what were going to see as very ugly headline inflation numbers
is beginning to generate a tail risk on that side of the mandate as well and i am becoming concerned
about that  indeed i think that its now appropriate that we begin as some of us already have to
move rhetorically toward acknowledging that risk and agreeing that it may be at the point where it
even exceeds the risk that we see on the growth side although i think were very uncertain about
that
now the concern i have is the following which is that there has been a lot of talk about
policy action  i dont think that a 25 basis point or even a 50 basis point move if its not viewed as
being the start of a continued increase is going to do very much on the inflation side frankly  we
had a good test of that over the intermeeting period  partly because of our rhetoric and for other
reasons the dollar strengthened  the twoyear rate rose 50 or 60 basis points and oil prices went
up 25  i do not think that with a small change in our stance we can do anything about commodity
prices and frankly its commodity prices that youre hearing about from your board members and
from people you talk to  its the real change in the relative price of those commodities that is
painful and the real change in the terms of trade coming through the dollar which is painful and i
dont think we can do very much about those in the short term  our objective of course as
everyone has noted is to prevent that from becoming a sustained and persistent source of inflation
so the problem then is that a small amount of movement will not solve the problem  a
small to moderate movement however might create some serious financial strains given the
fragility of the system  i think what we need to do is to decide when we reach that tipping point
there will be a tipping point at which were sufficiently confident that the system is stabilizing and
that we can begin to turn in a serious way to the inflation concern  a partial one step unless it
signals a longerterm tightening program could give us the worst of both worlds  we will just have
to make the judgment about when we have reached the point of having to switch from our previous
approach of supporting the economy and financial system to an approach that is aimed more at
containing inflation  its going to be a very difficult and delicate situation but i want to express
again my agreement with those of you who are worried about inflation and my belief that the time
might be relatively soon  but its going to be a very very delicate decision and one that we have to
make with great concern and consideration
a little anticlimactically i would like to say just a couple of words about the 1970s because
they keep coming up and i do think that these comparisons are a bit misleading  first in the current
episode commodity pricesparticularly oil pricesare basically most or almost all the inflation
that were seeing  that was not the case in the 70s  in particular inflation rose considerably before
the first oil price shock in 1973  pce inflation was 5 percent in 1970 which prompted the wage
price controls of course which is an episode were all familiar with and in 1972 before the oil
shock average hourly earnings were growing between 7 and 8 percent  there was already a serious
inflation problem before the oil price shocks came  hence credibility was already damaged at the
time of the oil price shocks  that is not the case here
second the movement in wages and core inflation following the oil price shocks in the
1970s was very striking  from the time of the oil price shock right before the second quarter of
1973 until the first quarter of 1975 total inflation rose a little over 5 percentage points reflecting the
quadrupling of oil prices  during the same period core inflation rose more than 6 percentage
points  in other words core inflation responded almost one for one to total inflation  moreover
average hourly earnings rose more than 2 percentage points and productivity and cost
compensation rose 3 percentage points in that year and a half  so there was a very strong
sensitivity of expectations and passthrough to these commodity price shocks  obviously weve
been seeing oil price increases since 2003 and they have not yet shown anything like that effect on
core inflation or on wages
the final observation id make about the 1970s is that we shouldnt forget that even in that
very bad situation with very poorly anchored inflation expectations the slowing of the economy did
do something to reduce inflation  in particular core inflation fell 3 percentage points during 1975
following the 197375 recession  so while we cannot do much about oil prices i do think that there
is some hope that weakness in the economy is going to provide some restraint on core inflation
which of course will generate a more stable total inflation rate if and when commodity prices
stabilize  so ive been very all over the map here  i apologize  i tried to organize my thoughts in
the meeting
my bottom line is that i think the tail risks on the growth and financial side have moderated
i do think however that they remain significant  we cannot ignore them  im also becoming
concerned about the inflation side and i think our rhetoric our statement and our body language at
this point need to reflect that concern  we need to begin to prepare ourselves to respond through
policy to the inflation risk but we need to pick our moment and we cannot be halfhearted  when
the time comes we need to make that decision and move that way because a halfhearted approach is
going to give us the worst of both worlds  its going to give us financial stress without any benefits
on inflation  so we have a very difficult problem here and we are going to have to work together
cooperatively to achieve what we want to achieve
the last thing id like to say is on communications  just talking about communications
following this meeting id like to advise everyone including myself to lean not to lurch  that is
we are moving toward more concern about inflation but we still have concerns about economic
growth and financial markets  we should show that shift in emphasis as we talk to the public but
we should not give the impression that inflation is the entire story or that we have somehow decided
that growth and financial problems are behind us because they are not  so if we can convey that in
a sufficiently subtle way i think we will prepare the markets for the ultimate movements that were
going to have to make
again i very much appreciate your insights and your attention today  we have a dinner at
730 and for that reason i think we should probably bring this to a close  well start tomorrow
morning with brians presentation of the policy options  the statement is essentially the same as
the bluebooks  there wont be any surprises there  so well begin with that first thing in the
morning  thank you
meeting recessed
june 25 2008morning session
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody
participants  good morning
chairman bernanke  we have two major items this morning  well first complete
the discussion of policy action and the statement and in the second part of the meeting well
discuss supervision of investment banks and some related policy issues  over lunch if time
permits wed like to hear laricke blanchard talk about congressional developments and well have
a chance to ask questions there as well  so without further ado let me turn to brian to introduce the
policy discussion
mr madigan4  thank you mr chairman  i will begin by referring to the draft announcement language in table 1 included in the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  as chairman bernanke noted yesterday this version is only slightly revised from the version discussed in the bluebook  rather than keep you in suspense i will note now that the revision is simply to strike the phrase nearterm from alternative b paragraph 4
turning first to alternative a the committee would ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and would issue a statement similar to the one published after the april fomc meeting  the second paragraph would indicate that economic activity has remained weak in recent months  it would recognize that consumer spending appears to have firmed but would go on to mention other aspects of economic performance that remain weak  the paragraph on inflation would cite the recent further increase in energy prices but would also note the stability of core inflation  it would again express the committees expectation for inflation to moderate partly reflecting a levelingoff of energy prices but would acknowledge that uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high  as in april the final paragraph would be silent on  the balance of risks and on the likely path of policy
for most of you your baseline outlook would seem to provide little support for selection of alternative a at this meeting  as was noted yesterday most of you conditioned your projections on a path for policy that begins to tilt up either immediately or sometime in the next few quarters  with such a policy path the central tendency of your projections points to a gradual pickup in economic growth and a fairly prompt drop in total inflation as energy and other commodity prices level out but only a gradual decline in core inflation which reflects the moderate amount of economic slack that you foresee over the next few years  as was illustrated in one of

4  the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 4
the optimal control simulations presented in the bluebook a case can be made for alternative a if you agree with the staff baseline outlook and favor aiming for
2 percent inflation over the longer term  one of the estimated policy rules presented in the bluebook also suggests modest further easing but again that prescription relies on the staffs forecast rather than on your generally stronger nearterm outlook  but given the modal outlooks of most members of the committee any case for easing at this meeting would seem to be best motivated by persisting concern about the downside risks to growth that many of you again cited in your forecast submissions the recession simulation in the greenbook provided one plausible scenario for the realization of such risks and suggested that the funds rate might need to be lowered to 1 percent
under alternative b the committee would leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting  the statement would note that economic activity continues to expand and as in alternative a would mention the firming of consumer spending  it would cite the same factors that could restrain economic growth that were referenced in april and would add the rise in energy prices to the list  the inflation paragraph would again convey the committees anticipation that inflation will moderate but would elide the explanation for that expectation and would reference high uncertainty about inflation prospects  the final paragraph would indicate that the downside risks to growth appear to have diminished somewhat and that the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased  as i noted previously we have suggested that the phrase nearterm be struck as the committees focus presumably is on longerterm inflation  the references to risks to both growth and inflation would be consistent with the concerns that you expressed in your forecast submissions  the statement proposed for alternative b seems generally in line with market expectations and an announcement along these lines is unlikely to provoke much market reaction  by pointing to reduced risks to growth and increased risks to inflation while not explicitly stating that the inflation risks predominate the committee would likely be seen as suggesting that its next policy move could be toward firming but also that such a move probably was not imminent
a policy approach along the lines of alternative b seems generally consistent with the projections that many of you provided for this round  although most participants conditioned their projections on a steeper policy path than the one in the greenbook many also appeared to assume that the firming process would not commence until later this year or in 2009  a decision to stand pat at this meeting might be motivated importantly by your sense that the risks in both directions around your baseline projections are substantial  while staying your hand today might risk a further upcreep in inflation expectations you might also be concerned that a policy firming now given that financial markets are still fragile would risk having outsized market effects with adverse implications for an economy that remains weak  as a result you may see benefits to allowing more time for financial markets to recuperate and more time for information on the outlook to accumulate before taking policy action
holding the funds rate at 2 percent at this meeting would be consistent with the
committees past behavior as captured by the estimated outcomebased rule presented in the bluebook
under alternative c the final column the committee would firm policy 25 basis points at this meeting  in the statement the paragraph on real activity would be identical to that for alternative b  however the third paragraph would provide the motivation for the action by emphasizing that overall inflation has been elevated that energy prices have risen further and that inflation expectations have risen further
no assessment of the balance of risks would be provided in the final paragraph thus avoiding a suggestion that the firming signaled a sequence of further rate increases nonetheless with market participants currently seeing only a small chance of a rate increase at this meeting an announcement along the lines of alternative c would likely prompt a considerable jump in short and intermediateterm market interest rates
although most of your forecasts appeared to assume that policy firming would begin later this year or early next year some of you explicitly assumed an earlier start to policy tightening  members might believe that firming at this meeting is warranted partly by evidence of some reduction in downside risks to growth  recent spending data suggest that economic activity has a bit more forward momentum than previously perceived reducing the odds on recession the modest improvement in financial market conditions points to some reduction in downside risks and the federal reserves special liquidity facilities appear to have been successful in reducing the odds of negative tail events and severe adverse feedback loops  thus members might see it as appropriate now to begin to reverse some of the committees past policy actions to the extent that those actions were seen as motivated by downside risks that have now diminished  also nearterm firming might be motivated by the further increases in inflation pressures and risks resulting from the continued upward march of energy and some other commodity prices  finally with inflation expectations continuing to show some signs of moving up a firming of policy at this time might be viewed as a timely shot across the bow that could be helpful in restraining such expectations
i thought that it might be helpful to conclude by reviewing two exhibits from the mediumterm strategies section of the bluebook starting with the optimal policy simulations that are reproduced in exhibit 2  the simulations underlying these exhibits are based on the frbus model after adjusting it to line up with the greenbook forecast and extension  as usual these simulations assume that you aim to minimize the sum of squared deviations of inflation from target squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the nairu and squared changes in the nominal funds rate  two key points can be drawn from these simulations
first whether policy firming should begin sooner or later may depend partly on your longerrun inflation objective  as shown by the black line in the top righthand panel if your objective for the longer run is to get back to a 2 percent inflation rate these simulations suggest that you can hold the funds rate steady or even ease slightly
further before beginning to firm in 2010  this policy path produces a somewhat faster decline in the output gap and thus somewhat slower disinflation than in the greenbook and extension  in contrast the simulations shown in the lefthand column suggest that pursuit of a 1 percent inflation objective would involve policy firming beginning quite soon  in general the policy paths described by many of you in your forecast submissions seem to fall between these two scenarios apparently reflecting your sense that aggregate demand growth could be a bit stronger and inflation pressures a bit more intense than projected by the staff as well as your dissatisfaction with a path for inflation that is as shallow as that for the scenario with a 2 percent inflation objective
the second point underscored by these simulations is that even though the near term path for the unemployment rate is a bit lower than in april reflecting the recent indications of somewhat greater strength in aggregate demand the mediumterm outlook involves larger and more persistent slack than foreseen in april under either inflation goal  despite that greater slack as shown in the bottom two panels core inflation under both inflation objectives runs 01 to 03 percentage point higher over the next four years than in the april simulations  that of course is the fundamental nature of a negative supply shock  policymakers are forced to accept some combination of greater economic slack and higher inflation during a period of transition to a lower output path and presumably to an unchanged longrun inflation rate  that same point was made in a bluebook box and in a staff paper on this subject
turning to your final exhibit i would like to note that in response to the comments of some members at recent fomc meetings the r exhibit in the bluebook has been augmented to include two additional measures of the real federal funds rate  line 11 in the table at the bottom shows a measure of the real federal funds rate that uses lagged headline inflation as a proxy for expected inflation  by contrast our standard measure shown on line 10 employs lagged core inflation as the proxy  line 12 shows a measure based on the staffs projection of headline inflation  both of these new measures at minus 13 percent are considerably lower than the current value of the standard measure minus 02 percent
i want to emphasize first that these additional measures should not be compared directly with the r measures shown in lines 1 through 9 of the table because the values of those measures are in part a function of the proxy used for expected inflation  for example the r value that would be consistent with the greenbook projection and the actual real funds rate based on the lagged fourquarter average of headline inflation is minus 07 percent  moreover even if we redefined the greenbookconsistent measure of r to use lagged headline inflation the implied
06 percentage point gap between the actual and the estimated equilibrium real rates would not necessarily imply that you should quickly raise the nominal funds rate by more than  percentage point  if like the staff you think it likely that headline inflation will moderate substantially later this year then it follows that a gradual firming of policy in nominal terms would be consistent with a substantial rise in the
real funds rate on this measure over time  indeed in the staffs view the average value of the real federal funds rate over the next few years on any measure is a bit above the corresponding value of r and consequently the trajectory of the real funds rate on any measure would be consistent with protracted slack and declining inflation over the next several years  of course you may not agree with the staff about underlying trends for prices and real activity and hence about the value of r  even if you do agree you may be dissatisfied with the projected trajectories for key variables such as output employment and inflation  such considerations illustrate why no estimate of r can be a complete guide to policy  that completes my prepared remarks
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for brian  president lacker
mr lacker  thanks brian for including these two new lines of the real federal funds
rate  as i remarked yesterday one use of the figures is to look back and judge the degree of
accommodation relative to other historical episodes  my understanding is that the greenbook
forecast of headline inflation four quarters ahead is higher now than it was in 2004 when the black
line in your exhibit 3 last hit its lowest point  my understanding is that if you drew that black line
using the equivalent of line 12 the greenbooks forecast for overall inflation the trough in 2004
would lie around zero and we would now be at minus 13
mr madigan  unfortunately president lacker i havent made that computation so i
cant confirm that
mr lacker  okay  just a comment then
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  just a quick question  when you do this based on the greenbook
projection for headline inflation how far forward are you going with headline inflation
mr madigan  well in any given quarter its four quarters ahead
mr mishkin  four quarters ahead
mr madigan  yes
chairman bernanke  any other questions
vice chairman geithner  may i
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  brian it might be helpful if you would circulate your
remarks about the new exhibit 3 and its implications after the meeting  that was very helpful  but i
just want to clarify one thing  could you just repeat what you saidlooking forward under any of
these basic measures where do you expect the real fed funds rate to be in relation to r
mr madigan  the actual real federal funds rate is above r under any measuresso in
other words our outlook is the same  these are just different yardsticks for assessing our basic
view of the stance of policy
chairman bernanke  if there are no further questions why dont we begin our go
round  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  id like to start by saying that i agree with your
comments yesterday about how we should proceed with the committee approach and think very
collaboratively about the policies and delicate strategies that were facing  although we disagree on
a number of the elements of the outlook i think that bringing everything together is a very
important part of this
i have fully endorsed funds rate cuts that we have taken so far in large part as insurance
against tail risks to growth  i think that policy last summer was much too restrictive given what we
were facing and that along the way a lot of these cuts have been motivated by tail risks to growth
the funds rate at 2 percent is pretty ample insurance to my mindmore so given the improvement
in the outlook for growth that weve seen as secondquarter growth has been marked up so much
and even more so given the inflation risks that were facing the risks to inflation expectations and
the potentially very low real interest rates that we might be looking at depending on the measure  if
we had the opportunity to recalibrate things a bit i probably would prefer something more like a
2 percent fed funds rate to be positioned against the different risks that were facing but i
understand that were at 2 percent and no change seems like the right move for today
i do have a few concerns about the way were thinking about this more in the line of risks
one is that as we take insurance against tail risk were positioning the funds rate against an event
that we think is not the most likely and is negative compared with where we are  unless and until
that event happens policy is somewhat accommodative because it hasnt happened and were
thinking that it is closer to where it ought to be if that should happen  unless you think that we
havent taken out insurance then i think that we have more accommodation than we might like
the second concern is whether it is possible to be more precise about what we mean by this
tail risk  i mean its really a catchall  nobody is very comfortable with all of this  what are the
markers that we could look at for improvement if we could quantify this somehow  is it that
financial markets should be functioning better  i think surely that is the case  is there a way that we
could describe that  im sure well disagree on many elements of this  labor market
improvementwe should expect that if the labor market does better than we were thinking then
that would tend to bolster consumption spending a bit better in the face of all the shocks that were
looking at  so the extent to which the labor market doesnt continue to deteriorate at least in line
with some of the recession scenarios and the tail risk scenarios that we were thinking about is a
potential marker
as we keep pushing out our expectation that the economy is going to weakenand weve
done this a number of timesand if were looking at the third quarter being revised upand i
agree that were facing a lot of risks therebut if we start marking that one up i think thats a
marker that we have to be concerned about  obviously if oil prices and commodity prices were to
decline and free up purchasing power for consumers that would help out too  so these are just
some of the things that come to mind  is there a way to think about the details a little better with a
bit less of a swag
another risk relates to financial markets  here im thinking about the really influential work
of yours in 1983 on nonmonetary influences on the great depression  a lot of the actions that we
have taken are defenses against those types of issues right  in the 1930s when the economy was
doing very badly and banks were failingim telling this to you and youve described it to
everyonethen the knockon effect was that the banks werent there anymore and important
resources for evaluating credit were lost and so it was more expensive and very difficult to do  we
have some of that going on now right  weve moved from the banks making mortgages and
holding them to the originate to distribute model  those resources have been dispersed and now
that securitization market is closed  i heard that very clearly yesterday  those important resources
arent there to originate mortgages so if we get to the point that buyers are willing to purchase these
houses that could be a concern
what happens if theres a true impairment to the financial capital stock and real resources
arent there anymore to help out with this  were probably looking at a reallocation of resources
from that sector of the financial market either back to banks or to somewhere else  but as we see
those resources reallocated and as we think about unemployment being higher we can talk
ourselves into thinking that a lot of slack is in the economy when in fact there may not be so much
slack  at some point it may be slack and at other times it wont be until those resources are
reallocated most efficiently  i think this could reduce potential growth rates and have structural
elements to it not just cyclical elements  so theres not a slamdunk for this  there is just a risk
that an element of that is playing out throughout this and other factors are superimposed on that
but its something that i worry about  in a robust type of policy development i think we should be
considering things like that  its just the case that in the current situation that were looking at
there might be a limited role for monetary policy to repair real capital stocks
another concern is that anytime weve engaged in substantial riskmanagement policies
there has always been difficulty in taking them back  thats part of the delicate strategy that you are
referring to i think  thats how i heard it  so we have to be very careful  theres a lot of art to this
clearly but it would be good if we could offer a few more bright lines about how well approach
that  still i certainly agree  i think we need to seek consensus  its our role to raise these issues
and then come to the best judgment  so im quite comfortable with no change today  im quite
comfortable with the language in alternative b although in the third paragraph we say however
in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and i think it would be better if we didnt
say continued  i think its enough to say the increases  in part i dont know if this is a marker
that if prices level out wed still be comfortable with the inflation risk  i think that there will be a
lagged effect of all the very large increases that weve seen for oil as they work their way through
if prices just level out we still have risks to inflation expectations  so i prefer taking that out
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you
mr kohn  a twohander mr chairman
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  president evans so you are arguing that the reintermediation process is
going to raise the nairu  i thought that the nairu depended on the structure of the labor
markets job matching and stuff like that so i didnt quite understand the connection
mr evans  im alluding without understanding or working out to a sectoralshifts
model of unemployment and how that search process could be more difficult  youre just taking
resources that over some period took a while to allocate to the financial sector and now they have to
be reallocated somewhere else
chairman bernanke  president hoenig
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  recognizing as i do where were coming from
and its dangers i think morerecent data suggest that the downside risks to growth have diminished
and in my judgment the current stance of policy is much more accommodative than necessary to
address these risks  i continue to believe that the two most recent policy actions of this committee
were more than sufficient and we really need to think about reversing them sooner rather than later
inflation risks have risen and we have seen erosion in longerterm inflation expectations  as i
noted in my previous remarks on the outlook if we do not begin to remove policy accommodation
soon i think we risk having to tighten policy more aggressively in the future to reestablish our
credibility
a couple of things  it struck me in looking at some of the major economies besides the
united statesthe european union japan and chinaif you look at the real interest rates theyre
low  i mean they are 1 percent or less or negative  so this is a lot of stimulus coming into the
world economy  and to make my point again i dont think you can have a sustained recovery with
a sustained inflationary environment which were in danger of encountering if we continue on this
path
over the past several weeks markets have significantly altered their expected funds rate
path to remove policy accommodation and therefore i dont know that doing something today
would be that big a surprise  the current funds rate path built into the market rates is closer to what
i believe is desirable to maintain price stability over the long run but i would prefer moving
somewhat faster3 percent by the end of this year and perhaps 4 percent by the end of 09  thus
in my view we should begin the process of removing monetary policy accommodation by
increasing the fed funds rate target by 25 basis points at this meeting  i think this action would
perhaps be somewhat unexpected and i recognize that there is some risk that markets would react
by moving the funds rate path up more dramatically than some might desire  however taking this
action would move us beyond merely talking about inflationary risk and would help us contain
inflation expectations by reaffirming our commitment to maintaining price stability  i think it
would quickly have a positive effect on the economy as these expectations begin to shift  now
assuming thats not the majority view today i would then encourage us to set the stage in our
language for stronger actions coming in the future  that is an important issue especially as you
mentioned yesterday in terms of remarks that we might make following this meeting in speeches
and so forth
finally let me just say that i think policy is currently accommodative perhaps very
accommodative  the insurance policy taken out earlier this year to guard against the tail risk of
spillovers of the financial distress to activity is less necessary perhaps far less necessary and it is
potentially even harmful to the efforts of maintaining price stability  therefore i encourage action
sooner rather than later  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the growth outlook has improved over the last
two months but the inflation picture has not  if anything it has deteriorated  i think its clear as
president hoenig argued that we should be tightening policy soon  the extent to which we brought
the funds rate down was predicated on downside risks and the notion that we could reverse course
rapidly  as downside risks now look much less likely i just dont see how an argument that
2 percent was the appropriate funds rate in april does not also imply that a higher funds rate would
be appropriate now  taking back some of that stimulus at this meeting however is probably
inconsistent with the commitment implied by the committees traditional interest rate smoothing
behavior  so im willing to stand pat today with the funds rate
the timing of such moves is going to present us with some trouble going forward though
even if we avoid outright recession as now seems probable the unemployment rate is likely to
keep rising for a time  but waiting isnt going to make it easier for us in any event because theres
a likelihood of the fourth quarters showing a slowdown when the stimulus wears off  but inflation
is going to increase in the near term as well  at least that seems likely and holding rates down
while that happens and while inflation expectations are already fairly elevated seems awfully risky
to me
i can understand the need for some conviction when we raise rates  when we began cutting
rates aggressively in january there were some significant uncertainties in the inflation outlook
though  i hope we dont set any higher a threshold of conviction for rate increases than we set for
rate cuts  looking back at 200304 and this is strictly in hindsight one can argue that we erred by
waiting too long to reverse course and ive heard you yourself make that argument mr chairman
so the logic of risk management works in both directions  i think we need to keep that in mind
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i favor alternative b with the proposed
wording  given the forecast and the risks around it our next move on the funds rate is likely to be
up and the question is when  assuming that the data on growth and inflation come in roughly as i
and the greenbook expect i would envision beginning to remove policy accommodation toward the
end of this year similar to the assumption in the greenbook  as i mentioned im not very
confident that the outlook for growth and employment has improved as much as the greenbook
assumes  im concerned that households and firms are in a python squeeze of an intensifying credit
crunch and a continuing decline in housing wealth as well as pressures from surging food and
energy prices  i think the economy has shown resilience so far and thats reassuring but i dont
think its assured for the future  the aggressive policy actions that we have put in place since
january are actually working to cushion the blow and thats part of the reason that we havent seen
a greater unraveling so far
i mentioned yesterday that with respect to inflation the behavior of both core inflation and
wages thus far makes me optimistic that headline inflation will come down if commodity prices
finally level off  but i think theres no doubt that the risks with respect to inflation are not
symmetrical at this point and they have definitely increased  i still see inflation expectations as
reasonably well anchored but theres no doubt that a wageprice spiral could develop and dealing
with it would be a very difficult and very painful problem for the committee  so while i feel that
we are essentially credible now i wouldnt want to take absolutely for granted that this is something
that we can count on going forward
at this point the federal funds rate remains well below the recommendations of most
versions of the taylor rule  i have viewed this as appropriate not largely as insurance against
downside risk but simply in refection of the unusually severe pressures from collapsing wealth and
tight credit and financial constraints  but it does seem to me to be appropriate going forward to at
least take out some insurance against the development of a wageprice spiral mentality and that
could take the form of gradually removing that discrepancy from what for example a taylor rule
recommends  but before we begin to do that it does seem to me that we should wait to get a
somewhat clearer picture of where the real side is going
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  in my view the economy is evolving in a way
that suggests that we need to take back sooner rather than later some of the insurance we put in
place against downside tail risk  i base this view on several points  first economic activity remains
weak  i dont dispute that  the data since our last meeting have been better than expected  the
greenbook forecasts as well as most privatesector forecasts have been revised up  so although
downside risks remain the tail risk of a significant recessionlike outcome for the economy though
it has not vanished has certainly diminished  second financial market indicators suggest that
market functioning though not back to normal has certainly improved somewhat in recent months
demand for fed liquidity from the primary dealers has fallen  primary credit borrowing generally
is down  now although we may wish to keep our liquidity facilities for now as a backstop the
extra accommodation that we have built into monetary policy may no longer be needed or even
appropriate at this point  the real economy and financial functioning have improved since our last
meeting but the inflation outlook has worsened as we have been hearing  headline inflation is up
expectations of various kinds are elevated  upside risk to core inflation has increased as the
greenbook has said  as i said yesterday these upside risks stem not only from the potential pass
through of energy prices but also in my view from the fact that were running a very
accommodative policy despite rising inflation
in fact i believe that policy has actually become more accommodative since the meeting at
the end of april  first the nominal funds rate has been at a constant level but expectations of
inflation have risen  so in fact the real funds rate has actually declined since our last meeting as
inflation has risen  second real rates of interest more broadly have been gradually drifting up since
late march or early april  the tips rates the real interest rates have been drifting up by
depending on which term you look at anywhere from 25 basis points to 35 basis points  so as the
real rates on riskfree securities have risen which may be appropriate given the fact that prospects
for the real economy have improved modestly the real funds rate has been declining  as a
consequence whatever you think about the level of the fed funds rate we have become more
accommodative since the last meeting
as ive argued before in this committee optimal monetary policy in a broad class of
models suggests that you get taylorrulelike rules but that the funds rate follows the real interest
rate as it moves around  optimal policy calls for following the real rates  i argued that was the case
and appropriate as real rates fell in the context of a weakening economy  it was important that
policy match those declines in the real rates which i think it did  its a coherent policy but it also
means that as real rates begin to rise as we have been seeing policy needs to adjust to those real
rates rising  now of course a lot of judgment is required in this type of policy  there are
smoothing issues  real rates could be quite volatile  theres debate about which real rate you want
to be looking at  i understand that  but i dont think theres any question that the objective should
be to match those movements in the real rates and we should be thinking about it in those terms
longterm inflation expectations have been volatile but have moved within a reasonably
defined range over the last period and im comforted somewhat by that  but as i have said i
believe that inflation expectations are fragile  at the very least the anchor is dragging and if we
continue to maintain a real funds rate well below zero with rising inflation well above our goal i do
not think we can continue to assume and trust that expectations will remain well anchored
weve done a good job with our words so far but with the shift from downside risk to
growth to upside risk to inflation we need to take action to ensure that price stability remains a
credible objective of this committee  if the economy and financial markets continue to evolve as
they have over the last couple of months that time may be soon  we must take back some of the
insurance we put on  not doing so soon risks having to respond more aggressively later on which i
believe will be much more difficult for the committee to do  in fact smaller moves sooner will
help with our credibility in the marketplace and will help anchor those expectations as we wait for
more data and for the economy to strengthen
in this regard i think we are fortunate that market participants reacted to the incoming data
by appreciably tightening their policy expectations  thus a move to raise rates is unlikely to catch
them off guard  moreover i dont think that we should disabuse them of such policy expectations
some might argue that an increase in policy expectations is a negative development  i would
disagree  i think that it reflects rising expectations of a somewhat stronger economy and concerns
about inflation  as the chairman said we should resist any erosion any rise in longerterm
inflation expectations  now as i said the timing of such a move is a judgment call and i expect
that my views will differ from those of some of my colleagues particularly since i had my fed funds
rate path rising to 2 percent by the end of 08  so let me turn to language
in the rationale in paragraph 2 i have only one suggestion  i think that we should
acknowledge that the functioning of financial markets while not back to normal has improved  so
instead of saying financial markets remain under considerable stress which we have said for
some time perhaps it might be easy to say just that the financial markets remain under stress
leaving out considerable  that acknowledges the fact that theres some improvement but that
stress is still there  finally in paragraph 4 i am pleased that the revisions make more explicit that
the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased and that the downside risks to
growth remain but are diminished  i was going to suggest that we strike nearterm but brian beat
me to the punch there  so i approve of that change  i think thats very good  in alternative b i
would prefer that we add some of the language from the chairmans recent speech to paragraph 4  i
think it would be a stronger message that the committee will take actions to ensure that inflation
expectations do not become unhinged and it would also convey that both parts of our dual mandate
price stability and economic growth are at risk should inflation expectations become unhinged
thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i support the action and language of alternative b
brians striking of nearterm is fine with me  this is a tough situation as we all remarked
yesterday  commodity prices are at the center of the problem that we find ourselves in  in my
view we didnt cause the rise in commodity prices  we may have contributed a little around the
edges but whatever we contributed was a necessary byproduct of what we needed to do to cope
with what was happening to the us economy and we cant reverse the rise in relative prices
without tremendous cost to the us economy  or even the rise in headline inflation we couldnt
undo that without putting a huge amount of slack in the economy to force down wages sticky
prices et cetera and that would not be appropriate
i think the classic response that weve all been talking about is to take a temporary increase
in inflation and in unemployment that facilitates the relative price changes that need to happen
concentrate on secondround effects and make sure those increases are temporary  i think thats
inadvertently what weve fallen into here  given the housing and financial shocks the 2 percent fed
funds rate of alternative b is consistent for now with continuing along the path of the temporary
increases in inflation and unemployment  unlike many of you i dont see the current rate as
extraordinarily accommodative given what else has happened in financial markets  there is no
insurance in the staff forecast right  the greenbook forecast has zero insurance in it  my own
forecast was a little stronger than the greenbooks  i think all of ours were a little stronger than the
greenbooks but even if i marked up r by  point or 1 point thats not a huge amount of
insurance in the circumstances that were facing  i note that no one sitting around this table
predicted a decline in the unemployment rate over the balance of the year so everybody has
5 percent or higher unemployment rates predicted by the end of the year  the staff thinks that the
current 5 percent is a little too high  so they are expecting the unemployment rate to come down
in the next month or two  given this were all expecting the unemployment rate to rise over the
balance of the year  i would think given the lags in policy that if you thought policy was hugely
accommodative youd see some decline in the unemployment rate over the next six seven or eight
months  i think our own forecasts suggest that some insurance might be here but not the amount
that im hearing some of you talk about  i dont see the consistency there
my own view is that theres probably a little insurance in it and its appropriate for now  i
agree that the next move in interest rates is more likely to be up than down  i assumed like
president yellen that it would be at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year  the rising
unemployment that we all expect should help damp inflation and inflation expectations and make it
very hard to pass through all these cost increases that were hearing from businesses that they want
to pass through and certainly make it hard for wages and cost pressures to rise
so i agree with everyone else that the weight in the two tails has shifted  theres less
weight in the downside risk tail for output and more weight in the upside risk tail for inflation  the
statement does a very nice job of saying that explicitly and i think that we just need to await
incoming data and information about inflation expectations costs and whatnot to see when the
appropriate time to move will be  because i dont think theres a tremendous amount of insurance
in there i think we can afford to be a little patient and data dependent here  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  president pianalto  oh sorry president plosser
mr plosser  governor kohn a question or a comment about interest rates  a lot of
our discussion has been centered on how accommodative we think policy is and how we interpret it
in the current environment  if i want to quantify the magnitude a bit at least the way i think about
it even if i believe that the economy is weak enough so that the appropriate equilibrium real rate of
interest is zero we have inflation running somewhere north of 3 percent  that would suggest a
nominal funds rate of about 3 percent as opposed to 2 percent  so roughly speaking i would
interpret that to say that we have roughly 100 basis points of extra accommodation built into our fed
funds rate relative to whatand thats assuming an equilibrium real rate of zero which might even
be low  so if im thinking about it that way could you clarify how we should quantify it in some
way
mr kohn  its very difficult  we dont know what inflation expectations are  were all
using proxies as came forth very strongly at the cape cod conference where we both were
president plosser  we dont even understand very well how expectations are formed and i think
what were looking for is how people perceive the cost of capital to finance purchases  so were
wondering whether this low interest rate is causing them to bring purchases forward from the future
to the present to induce them to buy things capital goods right  thats the interest rate were really
looking atthe perceived cost of credit to folksand im not sure that subtracting any rate of
inflation is the way to get that  obviously the cost of credit for housing is perceived as hugely high
right now  the cost of credit for automobiles is perceived as hugely high for reasons that perhaps
arent related to monetary policy  i dont think we see a surge in purchases of capital equipment
that would suggest that businesses perceive the cost of credit to be very negative  so i think
because we dont understand inflation expectations and cant measure them you have to look for a
lot of different things around the edges to confirm what people perceive the real rate to be  i just
dont see a lot of information that suggests that people perceive the real rate to be very negative and
that it is influencing how they manage their purchases of goods and services over time
chairman bernanke  thank you  i guess just to say it more simply all the rates that
have determined behaviorfor example mortgage rates auto rates or corporate bond ratesare
higher than a year ago  now unless there has been a major change in longterm inflation
expectations which the tips data dont suggest there dont seem to be indications as far as interest
rates that are relevant to peoples spending decisions that there has been a significant reduction
someone else had a comment  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  its directly on this point  it seems that in the situation were in with
very elevated spreads in libor there are almost no contracts in the real markets that are related
directly to fed funds  its usually through threemonth libor and we know that the spread is now
roughly 70 or 75 basis points higher than it used to be  it used to be about 10 basis points and now
its around 80  for me thats one rough proxy in how i think about thisthat the way in which our
actions are being translated into market prices is somewhat different from the way it was when the
spreads were lower
chairman bernanke  president lacker will back president plosser up though
vice chairman geithner  this is like pro wrestling  laughter
mr lacker  just a brief observation  spreads always rise in recessions  we always
lower real rates in recessions  so to say that the fact that spreads have risen by itself doesnt make
this an exceptional circumstance
chairman bernanke  the magnitude is somewhat greater though
mr lacker  for some not for others  corporate bond spreads arent as high
chairman bernanke  president pianalto we apologize
mr plosser  i apologize
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i support keeping the fed funds rate target at
its current level and the language in alternative b  i see some hopeful signs that stress in financial
markets has diminished as has the threat of a sharp recession  despite these recent signs i expect
that the growth momentum in the economy will build only slowly  moreover i continue to worry
that the residential real estate market could deteriorate even more than i had put in my baseline
projection  nevertheless i am somewhat more comfortable with the prospects for economic
activity than i was in april
at the same time i cant easily dismiss the recent behavior of energy and some other
commodity prices  i found the bluebooks supplemental analysis on oil prices inflation
expectations and monetary policy to be very useful in thinking about the dilemma that we face
the fact that oil prices have risen so sharply and have been so persistent highlights the risks
surrounding the downward projection that i have for core inflation  without some evidence of less
inflationary pressure i dont believe that the fed funds rate can be kept at its current level for very
long  but while i do believe that the next policy action will be a rate hike the potential for the
recovery to sputter makes me cautious about embarking on an upward trajectory for the fed funds
rate just yet  i believe that the language in alternative b conveys the right sense of direction for the
fed funds rate path with the right amount of caution  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president bullard
mr bullard  thank you mr chairman  us economic data have been stronger
than expected during the intermeeting period  the earlier very aggressive moves in january and
march taken by the fomc were viewed in part as insurance against the possibility of a very
serious downturn brought on by financial market turmoil  that very serious downturn has not
materialized  tail risk has diminished significantly  this means that this committee has put too
much economic stimulus on the table and must think about ways to remove it going forward
failure to do so will create a significant inflation problem on top of problems in housing and
financial markets  slack might be helpful as mentioned by governor kohn but those effects are
small compared with expectations effects  i think it is too early to tighten at this meeting
therefore i am supporting alternative b with the language proposed by president plosser  but
the committee has to think carefully about how and when to embark on a path for interest rates
that will set us up to achieve price stability in a reasonable time frame  my sense is that this will
require moreaggressive tightening of policy than currently envisioned in staff simulations
financial market problems have been described here as a slow burn and i think that may
well be an apt description  many firms in this sector took on too much risk and in retrospect
had poor business models  i expect that this will take a long time to unwind  despite this the
systemic risk component of the situation has diminished considerably  systemic risk is in part a
function of the degree of surprise in the failure of a financial institution that was perceived to be
in good health  surely by now few market participants would be surprised to encounter the
failure of certain institutions  failures should they occur can be handled in an orderly way
certain investors would lose out in such an event to be sure but my sense is that the panic
element that would be associated with systemic risk would not be present  i believe that we
should start to downweight systemic risk concerns substantially going forward because it is no
longer credible to say that market participants are surprised to learn of problems at certain
financial institutions  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  well first of all i believe that policy is well
positioned for now from a couple of perspectives  for the next quarter or two i think there is
still some potential for significant disappointment in terms of economic growthbut only for a
quarter or two  beyond that a pickup in real activity appears pretty likely  that is based on
what i know now further reductions in the federal funds rate shouldnt be required for the
economy to improve next year and beyond and we do have the liquidity facilities available
should strains in financial markets threaten to intensify  policy is also well positioned for now
from a second perspectivenamely that the fed funds futures curves have priced in an increase
in the funds rate beginning in the late summer or the fall  i think that this is appropriate because
i think we are going to find that we will want to and have to start moving to contain inflation
expectations  precisely when to move may turn out to be a difficult call but i would like to see
futures priced to anticipate such action on our partas indeed they are at the moment
that brings me to the recommendation and the language  i think the strategy expressed
in the bluebook associated with alternative b is fine for now and so i favor alternative b  the
language in alternative b is okay as well although i would endorse president plossers
recommendation to drop considerable from the description of financial strains  the other thing
i would point out is that the bluebook says that at least in the staffs judgment the language
associated with b might push back expectations for the onset of policy tightening  i am reading
from page 33  it is not that i am anxious to tighten necessarily as early as possible but i would
rather not push those expectations back at this point  so if that assessment is correct it might be
advisable to find a way to address that issue  i dont feel all that strongly about it but i think we
could if we wanted take the sentence in paragraph 4 thats in red drop three wordsthe first
word although a word at the end of the phrase remain and then they  so you would just
say downside risks to growth appear to have diminished somewhat which i think is true  it
doesnt suggest that we are sanguine about growth although i suppose it could be read that way
but i am a little concerned about the way we might change expectations based on the bluebook
commentary
chairman bernanke  you have your strunk and white style manual with you i
can see  laughter  thank you president stern  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i support alternative b  at this time there are significant downside
risks to the economy and financial markets as the collateral damage from the housing problems
works through the economy and financial institutions  at the same time continued increases in
oil and food prices raise the risk that some part of these supply shocks will be incorporated into
inflation expectations  in the absence of morecompelling evidence about which of these two
risks will dominate i would favor remaining on hold at this meeting  i hope that the economy
picks up in the second half of this year and that the financial markets stabilize so policy can
become less accommodative but it is not clear that this will be the outcome  while the inflation
outlook has been affected by continued energy shocks the future path of oil prices remains
uncertain and recent history has many instances in which oil shocks are shortlived and have
little effect on longerrun inflation expectations  until we have more clarity on the path of the
economy and inflation policy should remain on hold and our language should be consistent with
that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  i also prefer the fed funds rate
recommendation and language of alternative b  it captures the delicacyi think that word was
used yesterdayof the current tradeoffs and leans fairly heavily rhetorically against inflation and
inflation expectations  i note that inflation and inflation expectations are mentioned in both
paragraphs 3 and 4 using the language uncertainty    remains high and risks    have
increased  i think this constitutes considerable stress on the seriousness of our commitment to
address inflation and expectations and it is a complete statement and will serve to condition the
market  as brian said it suggests that firming later in the year could occur and i believe that is
appropriate  i would like to give the medicine that we have applied to resolve the situation and
the financial markets a little more time to work  i am in accord with governor kohns thinking
of stimulus or accommodation in terms of the cost of borrowing to real borrowersindividuals
and businessesand therefore we really have not seen a proportionate improvement in the cost
of capital notwithstanding such a strong reduction in the fed funds rate
so as of now i would expect to support a reversal a little later in the year  i also think
there is enough ambiguity currently that giving the situation a little more time to clarify would be
helpful  core inflation has not risen dramatically whereas headline has and it is headline that
the public is reacting to  measures of expectations such as they are seem to suggest that short
term expectations have risen more than longterm so there really hasnt been a clear breakout of
long term  it may be true that it would be too late if we saw that breakout but i think we can
afford to wait for a greater preponderance of evidence to accumulate over the next few weeks
before considering a reversal  so i support as i said alternative b and the language of
alternative b
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i listened very carefully to what was said around the table
yesterday and i especially listened very carefully to you  you made a very good and interesting
point about the differences from the 1970s  i would add that there are significant differences
from the 1970s  we didnt have the internet in the 1970s  we were not globalized in the 1970s
if you were selling oil into the market you sold to three buyersthe ten countries known as
western europe the united states and japanwhereas now you have several billion people
more to sell to  another difference is that the transmission mechanisms were not as fluid which
gets me to a question really with which i am wrestling constantly  before a cyclical slowdown
would lead to a lessening in price pressures  i am not so sure thats correct if we are talking
about a cyclical slowdown in the united states  we already have wages going up significantly
in the largest factory in the world which is china where we source a great deal  so there is
wageprice inflation but there are enormous demandpull forces that are quite different from
what we had before
i am a little concernedand i say this with not only respect but humility at having less
traininggovernor kohn when you say that we might tolerate a temporary increase in
inflation  if you opened the new york times this morning you would have seen that dow
chemical raised prices 25 percent after just raising them 20 percentin one month  by the way
i notice that these little bottles of water have gotten smallerthis will be a visine bottle at the
next meeting  laughter  what goes into thisthe plastic  heres the point  many micros
make a macro  micro business operators are not going to tolerate temporary increases in
inflation  they are going to act on them  i worry about that enormously particularly given the
fact that they are globalized and they sell to a globalized market  we can be victimized by that
now i may have overanalogized yesterday  you teased me after the meeting  although i like
janets analogy of the pythonone of my tutors at st johns had a python named julius
squeezer by the way  laughter  just to kill that reference i feel a bit squeezed here at the
table
you mentioned yesterday mr chairman three things that caught my ear  obviously we
need to strive to avoid bad outcomes  second we need to decide when were at the tipping
point  we need to pick our moment as you said  third you also said that we need to lean and
not lurch  i listened very carefully just now to president evans who was most eloquent in his
presentation  i happen to agree with him in terms of where i think we should be
yesterday i said i thought there were three ways to deal with our current predicament
now that the tail risks have shifted  one is to hope it will cure itself  i dont believe that is going
to happen because of the way micro operators operate  the second is to treat it rhetorically and
i think that the language in alternative b is quite good if that is the way you wish to go  but i
dont think it is going to get any easier as was mentioned earlier at this table  i am not sure that
things will get easier by august  we then get into an election season which i think still
conditions somewhat our thinking  i think it is important to take a shot across the bow  i think
we have to put some substance behind our words  as i said before and i know you know i like
to be liked  i dont like to be alone  but i am going to vote for alternative c  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me say just a few things  first to state
the obviousthere are risks on all sides of these decisions  second i will try to wade into the
debate briefly on this accommodation point  my own view is that policy is accommodativethe
degree of that is why we are having this debate  i think about our degree of accommodation as a
function both of our target fed funds rate and what the financial markets do with it by which i
dont mean just what the expected fed funds targets are out in the future but the transmission
mechanism  the degree of accommodation as we think about our decision now and in the next
several months will depend more on financial market developments than frankly the decisions
that we end up making on the target and it is very hard for us to judge the direction of these
markets  as much as we have talked about tail risks on the financial market side and the real
economy side being diminished i think all of us would say that there is a real chance that this
will be a long hot summer  it is hard to know what the credit channels are going to do with our
target federal funds rate  it is not obvious to me that we should try to perfectly offset the changes
in financial market developments by contemplating changes in the federal funds rate now
what i think most likely is that we wont be as certain as we would like to be regarding
growth risks and we wont be as certain as we would like to be regarding financial market
developments before we have to begin a posture of removing policy accommodation  so with all
those caveats and a view that policy remains more accommodative than we can allow it to be for
too long i will support alternative b and think that we have to remain very openminded very
nimble in our task of removing policy accommodation
in terms of president plossers suggestion on considerable i think the reason for the
debate over using that word is in my own view that these markets are still under considerable
stress but the trend from the last statement to this statement is that they are under less
considerable stress  therein lies the difficulty in wording this in the statement  if we do remove
considerable it wouldnt surprise me that when we next meet we will say boy it seems as
though stress is up  wonder if we should put it back in  i dont feel strongly other than i dont
like the idea of removing it now if we think that theres a chance that the trends which are very
tenuous turn around  so i think i would favor the language that you have written  thank you
mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  obviously as we have all discussed we are
facing enormous challenges from the continuing strength in prices and price changes in energy
and raw materials  now some of those are relative price changes that we dont have the tools to
address directly  recently we have seen wheat come down as australia has been able to replant
and it seems that things are going to come back  corn has gone up as we heard from a number
of people around the table because of the challenges there  we dont have the tools to address
that directly but obviously when so many of these commodity prices and energy prices are
going up that leads to concerns about where both headline inflation and core inflation are going
so we definitely do have to be very mindful of that
i think the type of approach that we are taking in alternative b is a reasonable one  given
the challenges that we are facing right now with the fragility in the financial marketsthe
continuing smoldering of those embers with still chances that they could reignite and cause us a
great deal of difficultyit seems sensible to me to be roughly where we are now in terms of
policy but to be signaling that we understand that challenges are coming from various sources
that could lead to inflation pressures and that we need to be ready to offset those
in terms of how accommodative monetary policy is i think actually it would be
worthwhileand maybe at the end of this i might pose a question to brianto look at libor
ois spreads and how much they typically go up during recessionary periods  i know that other
risk spreads typically go up but my understanding is that those typically dont go up as much
since so many contracts are based off the onemonth and threemonth libor that 75 basis
points suggests that at least now we might want to take that into account in thinking about where
monetary policy stands relative to other times when we would have had a funds rate at roughly
this level
in terms of the language i share governor warshs view on the use or lack of use of the
word considerable  i think president sterns suggestionthis is always a very dangerous and
difficult gamewould actually push the markets further than they are because i agree that
broadly the path that they are seeing in the future is a reasonable one for them to see  this
language would roughly keep it there  taking out the acknowledgement of downside risks to
growth remaining would make me concerned because 1 i certainly see those as still being there
and 2 i think that would push the markets further to think that this is a signal that next time we
are going to do it and i dont think we are quite there yet  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i do support alternative b and the current
language in the statement  i have no problem with that  i think it conveys what we need to
convey  although i think that the next move is very likely to be up and it maybe should be done
quite soon i would argue that we still need to have a lot of flexibility and to think in terms of
having a lot of flexibility in where we may have to head in the future  i want to argue along
those lines and outline why i think that is the case
the first issue is something that the chairman mentioned yesterday about which i felt
very stronglyin fact i meant to say it but as always the chairman says things better than i
could in this contextthat there really is still a very serious possibility that the shoe could drop
in the financial markets  the chairman mentioned a set of institutions that we have to be
concerned about and although there has been some improvement in terms of the stress that the
financial markets are under i dont think we are out of the woods yet  we are likely to be but
we have to be ready to recognize that things could go south  so thats one issue  the second
issue is that the recent positive data we have seen are again very tenuous to me  im hoping that
they indicate that things are going in the right direction  but a bunch of things make me very
nervous which i mentioned yesterdayhow consumers react in housing crises consumer
sentiment and the big problem that is going to occur when people have to face very high prices
of food and energy which hit their pocketbook very directly  so again that could be quite
contractionary  the good news that we have seen recently might reverse very quickly  the third
issue is that i think the headwinds could be very substantial in the future that this cleanup will
take a long time and in that case we could have very slow and subpar growth that could widen
output gaps more than the greenbook and most participants here are expecting
so i do not consider the current stance of monetary policy to be overly stimulative  for
me it is just about right and very much along the lines of what i think would be optimal policy
of course my view relates not only to the real economy  i also think that inflation expectations
as far as i can tell so far are reasonably well contained  there is very little movement in the
measures of inflation expectations that i pay most attention to  that argues that our stance is
about right  i would also very strongly argue that i do not think that we have taken out a lot of
insurance  i have argued that before  we have moved less gradually which i think is very
beneficial and i would commend the committee in that regard  but we moved in line with what
the forecasts have been telling us optimal policy would be and i think that is quite important
however here is why i think we need to have flexibility in the other direction  if you
think about a riskmanagement approach it should not be focused just on tail risk to economic
growth which has been our most major concern because of the financial disruption  it equally
implies that symmetrically we should be just as worried about tail risk to inflation particularly
to longrun inflation expectations which i think are the key driver of underlying inflation which
is what monetary policy can particularly deal with  here we have a situation in which we have
hit the perfect storm of shocks because of the huge supply shock and there are much more
serious upside risks and tail risks in terms of longrun inflation expectations  so i really do
worry that with longrun inflation expectations and therefore underlying inflation we are in a
more fragile situation and that we have to be very cognizant of that in terms of what we do in the
future
the bottom line is that we may have to move very quickly to raise rates if any of several
things happens  one is that headwinds are not as serious as i think they are likely to be  there is
certainly a very serious possibility that things could be better than i expect  i would not be
unhappy so i would not get depressed about that  really more depressing would be if inflation
expectations started to look as though they were getting more unanchored  particularly i would
worry much more about what happens in terms of inflation compensation and the survey of
professional forecasters paying some attention to consumer surveys but putting a lot less weight
on them  if the canary starts to look as though it is keeling over we have to move very quickly
and so i am going to watch that canary very very carefully
mr fisher  before the python gets it laughter
mr mishkin  before the python gets it  i think another consideration is very
important  i have to commend you on the bluebook this timeit just had some great boxes
laughter  it would be nicer if they had a little color to them  as a textbook author i think they
could have been a little ritzier and have had a little color but they were great boxes  in
particular a very important box was the one on the optimal reaction to oil price shocks  one
thing that comes out very strongly from that box is that if your credibility is weak on
commitment to price stability and containing inflation expectations you would have to tighten
more to restore that credibility and get to a policy that would produce better outcomes  so here
is an issue that with these supply shocks potentially causing a problem for longrun inflation
expectations we actually may have to react more quickly and more aggressively than we
otherwise would  this is an issue that i have been concerned about in terms of communication
strategyabout how we better anchor longrun inflation expectations
so my bottom line is that i support alternative b  i would like to keep the language the
way it is currently which i think works quite well  but i do think that going forward we should
not lock ourselves into what our policy is going to be in either direction  we need to preserve
flexibility because we could be very surprised although i think that the signal we have made that
we are more concerned about inflation risks is absolutely appropriate  we have to make clear
that we will do whatever it takes including raising interest rates when unemployment is rising if
we feel that longrun inflation expectations and inflation are not remaining under control
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i just want to say at the
beginning that i think the way you framed your remarks yesterday had perfect pitch and balance
and it is really important that we not get ahead of ourselves in taking too much comfort from the
fact that the first half was not as bad as we thought and think that the risks on the growth front
are definitively behind us  the improvement in financial markets that many of you spoke of is
not as significant as we think or hope we have had a lot of false dawns over this period  a lot of
what you see as improvement is the simple result of the existence of our facilities in the implied
sense that people infer from our actions that we are going to protect people from a level of
distress that we probably have no desire will or ability to actually do  it is sort of like waking
up in the hospital and having them say you are not dead yet but we are not sure youre going
to live  it is not as good an improvement and there has been a material erosion over the past
four weeks  it is very unlikely that you will have a substantial improvement in overall
confidence in markets a durable improvement in market functioning and a substantial reduction
in those spreads until there is more clarity about the likely path of the economy going forward
house prices in particular and therefore the cash flows associated with the huge amount of credit
that was extended over the past five years
again it is going to be very hard for us to have a better feel for the balance of risks on
growth front and the financial sector until we think we see signs ahead of some significant
deceleration in the rate of decline of housing prices if not some actual bottom  on the basis of
everything we know that is still several quarters ahead  maybe it is going to surprise us on the
upside and maybe we are going to see a big improvement in housing demand but i think that the
sense of a bottom looks to be several quarters ahead of us still
i would say that the risks are still acute  sure the markets are a little more confident that
we are going to successfully avoid a systemic financial crisis but i wouldnt take too much
comfort from that  i think it is also plausible that oil will be at 150 or 200 over the next six
months or so  there is some material probability that the set of challenges on that front is going
to get worse  so all that is just in favor of a fair amount of care and caution now given the scale
of the uncertainty out there and how fat the tail risks are on both sides of our mandate going
forward
i like and fully support the language in alternative b  i would notas you might sense
from my commentstake out the word considerable from the characterization of stress  i am
pretty comfortable with the framework laid out here and more important mr chairman with
the broad balance and strategy that you outlined yesterday
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  in april we signaled that
following our aggressive rate actions and our other efforts to support financial markets it was
going to be a time to pause and to assess the effects of our actions  that was not that long ago
and i think it is appropriate to continue our watchful waiting for just a bit longer
i talked yesterday about the balance of tail risks as opposed to the balance of risks  i
think that although the tail risks on the growth and financial side have moderated somewhat
they are still quite substantial  i agree with the vice chairman on that point  they arise from
two separate but related sources  the first is that notwithstanding the strongerthanexpected
performance in the second quarter i think there is an excellent chance that we will still see a
recessionary dynamic with the associated strong movements in employment and production
secondagain as the vice chairman mentionedi do not agree that systemic risk has gone
away  i think it is in abeyance  there is perhaps if anything excessive confidence in the ability
of the fed to prevent a crisis situation from metastasizing  even if we dont have a failure of a
major firm we still have the possibility of a significant adverse feedback loop as credit
conditions worsen and banks come under additional pressure  so if i could try to think about
thisi dont want to say mathematicallya lot of our discussion has implicitly suggested that
there has been a linear model which is that we are just trying to balance on the scales this risk
against that risk  again if you are worried about preventing bad outcomes you have to worry
more about nonlinear or discontinuous changes  i think that at this point we still have
significant risk of a nonlinear discontinuous change in the financial markets or in the real
economy
tail risks have risen for inflation  there is no question about it  i take what has been
said around the table extremely seriously and i am quite anxious about it i have to concede  if i
were making a comparison of tail risks to tail risks i still think that the inflation tail risks have
not yet reached the level of the concerns i have about the financial crisis  in particular some
important indicatorssuch as wages inflation expectations and core inflationhave not yet
signaled a major shift  that being said i do think we need to acknowledge the relative change in
those risks and we need to begin to prepare the market for the normalization that is going to
have to come
both president fisher and president stern talked about the rhetorical aspects of our policy
and the effects on policy expectations and i think we are all in agreement that words mean
nothing unless they are eventually backed up by actions  on the other hand actions may be
better if they are preceded by words if you will  we do need to begin to prepare the markets and
to communicate clearly so that people will know whats coming and that the system will be
better able to deal with that
if i thought for sure that we were going to begin renormalizing very soon i would
propose doing it today  why wait  but i think enough uncertainty and enough risks are on both
sides that there is some benefit from waiting just a bit longer to see first how the financial
markets evolve and second whether we continue this strongerthanexpected growth pattern or
whether we begin to see a more recessionarytype of pattern  in particular between now and the
next meeting we have two employment reports a lot of other relevant information and a lot of
insight from the financial markets  at the same time on the inflation side we will see how
commodity prices evolve whether we have any kind of relief from what we saw in the last
intermeeting period how the dollar behaves and how inflation expectations behave  all those
things will give us a better sense of where we are and how we should proceed
so i think we should try to be nimble  we should try to respond to the information as it
comes in  we should be focused particularly on tail risks  i think we should begin to move or
should maintain market expectations toward tightening  president fisher i think i have to note
for the record that i dont think we should let political considerations affect our decisions in any
way and i am not concerned about that  i think we are all prepared to do what is necessary  i
dont know what we are going to do in the next meeting or the meeting after that  but my
expectation now is that as others have mentioned we will begin normalizing interest rates
relatively soon and we should if possible begin to prepare the markets for that
for today as i have indicated i recommend no change in the federal funds rate target and
alternative b for the statement  i think alternative b captures the facts pretty well on the whole
i wont go into it but i think the inflation paragraph is a little more hawkish  it drops the
discussion of a levelingout of commodity prices  it doesnt refer to core inflation which we
have taken before as sort of a reassuring element  im disappointed that president fisher is going
to vote against his own language in alternative b paragraph 4 which we have adopted and
which i think is a very good expression of the risks
mr fisher  i appreciate the adoption of the language  i think it is much better
chairman bernanke  i think president sterns suggestion is interesting  i am a
little worried that it might go just a bit too far in suggesting that we have discounted the
downside risks  i am struggling with the considerable in alternative b paragraph 2  i have
sort of heard two for and two against  i dont know if others have a view  it is a bit risky to
change given how quickly things can move  but if others would like to express a view i think
yet a third thing that we could do would be to say financial markets though somewhat
improved recently remain under considerable stress  that might be a way to address it  does
anyone have any thoughts on that word  any concerns  president lacker
mr lacker  i thought vice chairman geithners characterization of markets was
pretty good but it is compatible with your suggestion
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  if we look back and try to recalibrate at each meeting
whether things are getting better or things are getting worse we would regret each zig and each
zag  so i would just say that we have a suite of facilities in place  they are in place today
they are exceptionally significant in terms of a change in policy  they are there because we
think they are playing an important role in helping facilitate the necessary process of repairing
markets et cetera  if we were going to take them back tomorrow or dial them back substantially
then i would be willing to rationalize and explain that part of the judgment is that we think things
are improving materially  i just feel as though the risk is too high
chairman bernanke  i think the vice chairman raises an interaction that i hadnt
thought of which is that our facilities are existing under the premise of unusual and exigent
circumstances and we dont really want to undercut that  president fisher
mr fisher  i would support what vice chairman geithner mentioned because i think
we may be faced with a situation of having to raise rates even though there is considerable risk in
the financial market  so i think showing sensitivity to that is very very important  on a second
point mr chairman i do appreciate the change in the language  i also suggested some changes
to alternative c but i wont go into them  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  yes  president plosser
mr plosser  given that i suggested removing the word considerable my purpose
there was merely to indicate as many people around the table have said that things are
somewhat better  i dont think that we should suggest that problems are solved because things
are still under stress  i agree with vice chairman geithner in that regard  i am willing to
withdraw that suggestion  i dont feel that strongly about it  i thought it would have been useful
to convey a direction that we saw  but i dont disagree with vice chairman geithners
suggestion that these things can reverse themselves and maybe a little more stability might save
us some zigging and zagging down the road  so i withdraw that suggestion  i can live with the
language as it is if that simplifies things
mr mishkin  and it will come out in the minutes
chairman bernanke  of course all of these subtleties will
mr plosser  as they always do
chairman bernanke  i would like to propose no change in alternative b as given
in exhibit 1  any further comment  if not could you please take the roll
ms danker  yes  this vote applies to the directive as well as the language of the
statement in alternative b of exhibit 1  the federal open market committee seeks monetary
and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output
to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in
reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around
2 percent
chairman bernanke                yes vice chairman geithner         yes president fisher                      no
governor kohn                       yes
governor kroszner                 yes
governor mishkin                  yes
president pianalto                   yes
president plosser                     yes
president stern                        yes
governor warsh                     yes
chairman bernanke  thank you  why dont we take a fifteenminute coffee
break and we will come back and discuss investment banks
coffee break
chairman bernanke  why dont we commence then  this is a joint fomc and
board meeting and so i need a motion to close the board meeting
mr kohn  so move
chairman bernanke  without objection  okay  our topic for this morning is
investment banks their supervision and related policy issues  let me turn it over to art angulo
of the new york fed who will introduce the topic  art
mr angulo5  thank you mr chairman  were now in the handout  why dont we start on page 2 and ill give you an overview of where we are headed this morning at least from my section  first ill talk a bit about the objectives and the approach of our monitoring program  then ill talk about how were focusing primarily but not exclusively on four investment banks and where our focus is there ill say a few words about the extent of usage of our section 13 facilities  again the pdcf is primarily our focus but for the sake of completeness ill also discuss and provide some highlights on tslf usage by the primary dealers  then ill close by just highlighting nearterm issues that were addressing or dealing with

5  the materials used by messrs angulo alvarez and parkinson are appended to this transcript appendix 5
on page 3 in terms of the objectives of our monitoring program were very cognizant that our efforts are tied closely to our section 133 authority in the establishment of the primary dealer credit facility  our effort does not stem from our general supervisory examination authority  were very clear on that  we have two key objectives  the first is the ability to exercise informed judgment about the capital and liquidity positions of the primary dealers that have access to the pdcf second and just as important were aiming to in shorthand mitigate the moral hazard that accompanies the creation of the pdcf in particular  so we will make sure that the pdcf does not undermine the incentives for the primary dealers and the firms that own them to manage capital and liquidity more conservatively
on page 4 in terms of our approach our focus is on the firms that own primary dealers that are not affiliated with financial holding companies  thats primarily but not exclusively the four largest investment banks  ill touch at the end of my presentation on several other primary dealers with which weve had interactions of late  our effort does include an onsite presence but that is limited to examiners at each of the four largest investment banks  we also have a small offsite staff which includes staff members from our research group our markets group our legal group and bank supervision  we are in direct contact with the management of these firms  we are obtaining information directly from the firms as well as from the sec and of course we are communicating and coordinating closely with the sec  its important to point out however that were not engaged in traditional bank supervision  our scope is fairly narrow  were not conducting examinations and were not providing or issuing examination reports back to the firms  therefore we are making assessments i would say without the normal range or normal complement of supervisory protections that were accustomed to  to be frank that carries with it some risk and some vulnerability for us  ill touch on that at the end of my presentation as well  our current focus is limited or narrowly focused on capital as well as liquidity which ill get into in a moment  so lets turn to page 5
page 5 gives us a view of the leverage of the four investment banks  i should note that it may be a bit confusing at first glance  leverage is typically expressed as a multiple  weve converted that into ratios because bank supervisors tend to look at ratios  so bear that in mind  investment bank leverage does tend to be cyclical  this graph picks up really the latter half of the last cycle so i can orally give you some perspective  if this graph had moved back to the left in approximately 1999 to 2001 you would have seen the investment banks deleveraging in response to the russian default and the ltcm crisis in the third quarter of 1998  so we would see leverage coming down between then and 2001  in 200102 leverage was essentially flat and then this graph picks up the increasing leverage from 2004 to the end of 2007  as you can see 2007 marked the cyclical low point in the ratio or high point in leverage as a multiple  since then the firms have been deleveraging  right now they are clustering around 4 percent with the trajectory i hope still up and we may have something to say about that
chairman bernanke  art could you define leverage in this picture
mr angulo  this is gross leverage so it is just equityin this case a ratio of equity over total assetsa very blunt measure
page 6 gives us a more current view  in the lefthand panel is the tier 1 capital ratio for the four largest securities firms  as i think you know the sec has made a decision to use and hold investment banks to a basel ii ratio thats consistent with how the bank supervisors apply it  to date the firms have not disclosed those ratios that begins this quarter the second quarter  for goldman lehman and morgan stanley that quarter ended may 31 2008 so we show the estimated ratios there
these were not in their earnings releases although they were picked up by some of the analysts in their conference callsso these numbers are seeping out there
merrill reports on a bank cycle june 30 so they have not yet released their tier 1 capital ratio
a couple of takeaways from the left side of this page  first the quarter has not ended but merrill was obviously low compared with its peers  they do have the benefit of seeing and being aware of where their peers have come out so we shall see if merrill takes some action in the near term to bolster capital  the second point is that the investment bank ratios look fairly high compared with where the commercial bank tier 1 capital ratio would be  there are a couple of reasons for that  first the assets of the investment banks are concentrated in the trading book so there are two issues there  those assets tend to have a lower credit charge  the other issue which we have to do more work on is that we need to understand better the modeling methodologies and the model approvals that the sec has given these firms to compute tier 1 capital  that could be a significant factor as well  so at first blush they look very healthy very high but i think it will take more analysis to get beneath those
the righthand side of page 6 gives another way of looking at capitalwhat we call an frbnyadjusted leverage ratio  what were trying to do here is to have another way of putting investment banks and commercial banks on a somewhat similar footing  so in terms of the numerator we use tangible equity for two reasons first its a higher form of equity capital perhaps the highest form  second and just as important it avoids current differences between how investment banks and commercial banks calculate tier 1 capital  right now theres a grandfathering period in which the securities firms are allowed to carry a higher portion of subordinated debt in tier 1 capital  it does not apply to bank holding companies  this puts them on more of an equivalent basis in terms of the numerator  the deal is the same with the denominator  again were trying to make allowances for the differences in business models  so here we subtract from the denominator secured financing assets  these are reverse repos and securities borrowings  of course these are collateralized by cash and thus are relatively lowrisk assets  so by making those two adjustments we have a somewhat comparable view  the takeaway here is that they dont look too far apartthey are not dissimilarat least at this point in the cycle
why dont we move now to page 7 to liquidity  i have a picture of liquidity but not a full picture  this shows the trend in parent company liquidity pools  this is unencumbered cash or highquality securities at the parent company of the four investment banks  as you can see the trend has been increasing since the middle of march  the general trend has been to increase  this of course tells us only half the story because one wants to know what that pool is held against  so lets turn to page 8 and i can talk a bit about how were trying to look at and assess this
weve been engaged with the sec and have entered into an approach in trying to assess liquidity at the four investment banks  when we first started this endeavor back in late march the first thing we did was to go back to the firms and to say show us what would happen to liquidity if you experienced a bear stearns fullrun kind of scenario  for that exercise we want to know what assets you have eligible for the pdcf  we want to know how bad and how dark it would get  that exercise  was pretty demanding  no one would have passed the test  we looked at that and asked whether a full run on the institution was an appropriate way to look at it or an appropriate standard to hold them to  so we came up with another scenario that we put back to the firms  we basically said listen we want you to do a stress analysis for us  look at something thats pretty severe but short of a full bear stearns scenario  look out over thirty days  by the way you have no access to the pdcf lets see how that looks  were in the process of doing that right now  the table on the left gives you an idea of some of the things that were looking at and how weve asked the firms to provide the information to us  basically there are several buckets
1 their unsecured and secured funding 2 what comes on the balance sheet under stress either general market stress or firmspecific stress and 3 the impact from operating cash flows toward the bottom  those are the combination of liquidity claims that they would face under stress  the last piece is the additional funding from affiliated or unaffiliated bank lines along with obviously the liquidity pool which we have separately  basically were engaged in an exercise in which we compare and converge assumptions  weve had multiple discussions with each of the four firms trying to understand where their assumption differed and trying to converge those  we then constructed or are in the process of constructing a cash flow analysis  again we are relating their cash needs under stress given these assumptions to their available liquidity pool plus the unaffiliated or affiliated bank lines that can be drawn
the drivers here obviously are going to be the mix and term of secured funding which is going to be a big driver in terms of the liquidity needs as well as some of the operating cash flow assumptions that firms make in looking at a stress scenario  we are fairly close to pulling together information with which we can construct an analysis go back to the firms share with them our assessments of where they are and give them a chance to explain to us how we were spot on or where we may have missed certain things  but those conversations will happen in the near future  so thats basically what were doing in terms of liquidity  it has been an interesting exercise  i think that there is no simple way to look at liquidity but that this is the  best way to do so
lets turn to page 9  i have just a few words about the use of both the pdcf and the tslf  i have graphs later on the tslf  a graph of the pdcf usage would be kind of boring  it would show bear stearns as far and away the dominant borrower actually i think bill dudley conveyed to you yesterday that monday was their last night of borrowing under the pdcf  so bear stearns is now out  until very recently there were three others that ill call chronic users of the pdcf  first we had cantor ill say a few words about that  they started borrowing in late march initially
600 million to 700 million  they stabilized in midapril at about 500 million we saw that borrowing coming in every night  members of the team here spent one afternoon at cantor at the end of april  we asked them for some information in advance  we spent a good chunk of time with them  we came away not being comfortable with the number or the size of their borrowings in relation to the firms capital  we then consulted with our colleagues in both the legal and markets groups  we asked cantor to submit a plan to wean itself from the pdcf and to submit that to us in writing  we then followed up with a friendly letter from mr
dudley and mr baxter asking for a little more information and a little more specificity  they got the point  they started to bring that down in accordance with the schedule they gave to us  in fact they ended up winding down to zero in their borrowing last week ahead of schedule and they obtained thirdparty financing  so that was the cantor story
countrywide was a somewhat similar situation  they had been borrowing from day 1 of the pdcf  initially they would ask us for 1 billion  they had borrowed and stabilized at about 900 million  our markets group initiated a conversation with countrywide securities at the end of may  in short we were uncomfortable with in essence providing bridge financing to the close of the acquisition by bank of america  we felt some vulnerability there  so our initial salvo or proposal back to countrywide securities was that they needed to wind down the use of section 133 facilities by the end of juneboth the pdcf and the tslf  they came back to us and in essence said well couldnt you just let us go into july a bit because our merger is supposed to be approved today actually by the bank of america board
our legal day 1 our closing is july 1  we can transfer positions july 2  whats a couple of days among friends  we had a little negotiation back and forth  we reached i think an agreement that was amenable to all  they agreed to wind down their use of the tslfno new borrowings  they could swing some of that into the pdcf  we would allow them to go until the closing july 2 when they could transfer those positions  in return we got a little extra margin  so in effect those borrowings were being collateralized at a margin of roughly 7 percent  we got an additional
13 percent bringing us to 20 percent which will bring us through until july 2  so i think all sides are reasonably comfortable there and with friendly persuasion dudley and baxter sealed the deal there
let me say a few words about barclays capital  we handled this a bit more informally  they started using the pdcf more in late march at around 5 billion they got to a peak of about 7 billion  both bank supervision and markets had
conversations with barclays asking them to tell us a little more about why they were using this  whats the rationale  they had a consistent story  they would tell us that it was economically advantageous for them to use that  they thought it was good  in one conversation with our colleagues in the markets group one of the traders conveyed that barclays thought they needed to support the tslf in much the same way that they supported open market operations  our colleagues in markets very quickly disabused them of that notion  after a couple of conversations they got the message  they eventually ceased borrowing from the pdcf around the beginning of june  so as of now the only outstanding we have is with countrywide securities and that should come to a close next week knock on wood
again just for the sake of completeness on page 10 ill talk about the tslf usage  first schedule 1 which is omoeligible collateralas you can see among the primary dealers merrill has had the highest amount outstanding  merrill is i guess the tan line  the biggest users have been the commercial banksdeutsche bank is up top a pretty consistent user  then citigroup the green line which has also been a fairly consistent and heavy user  lets turn to schedule 2 page 11 which is the less liquid collateral  here among the primary dealers lehman the blue line has been the most consistent user followed by merrill lynch  as you can see ubs among the banks was clearly far and away the biggest user although within the past two weeks they have reduced their tslf borrowings  so thats very briefly the top five  theres again a bit of a mix here  but as you can see the investment banks are not the biggest users of the tslf
lets turn to page 12 and ill finish up here  ill just highlight a very nearterm challenge that we face and i think it will provide a nice transition to scotts and pats portions of the briefing  i dont want to get too much into their sections  but i think generally we have an issue  i think that the longer we stay on site with this effort the reputational risk to the federal reserve increases  as governor kohn testified last week were not examining we are just very narrowly focused  i think that message was well received  at this time its not too problematic  but if someone is up on the hill six months or a year from now i think its going to be very difficult to say that were just doing this liquidity and capital thing  people are going to want to know a little more about our judgments and how we made those judgments  as i said early on i think theres some risk to making those judgments without having a little more information  so i think the trick for us is if we have our traditional bank supervision model on the left and what were doing right now on the right we have to move this way more to the left  by no means should we be way over here  but i think we have to figure out how to get this way a little more  with that i will end my remarks and pass to scott and then to pat
mr alvarez  well as you can tell from arts presentation theres been a significant amount of informationsharing and collaboration already between the federal reserve and the sec  so weve taken this opportunity simultaneously with whats going on with the primary dealers to fashion a document that will lay out a framework for how this informationsharing and collaboration will go forward
weve made some pretty good progress on a document but were still negotiating  in fact the chairman is negotiating this afternoon with chairman cox  this is one in which the principals have been intimately involved
the agreement as it is currently structured really has two parts  the first part outlines plans for sharing information between the two agencies  here i would divide the world into two pieces  there are the consolidated supervised entities cses which are the four large investment banksgoldman sachs morgan stanley lehman brothers and merrill lynch  we have agreed to share information and analysis of the financial condition risk management internal controls capital liquidity and funding resources of those firms  the agreement is focused primarily on those areasso the financial condition liquidity and risk management of the firms  as you know we have accessed information from these companies in connection with our providing liquidity through the pdcf and the tslf so well share that with the sec  similarly the sec which is the primary regulator for those and has access to much more information will share their information with us
weve also agreed to share information and analysis on various financial markets that these companies are intimately involved inin particular the triparty repo market and the interbank lending market
now two bank holding companies participate in the secs cse program citigroup and jpmorgan chase  we have agreed to share with the sec the same type of financial and riskmanagement information regarding those two firms but only to the extent that that information affects the brokerdealers that are controlled by those two firms  so we are not expecting nor is the sec expecting us to share information that relates to the condition of the bank or the condition of the other nonbank portions of either of those two firmsjust the part related to their brokerdealer
we have an interest here in the federal reserve in the financial condition of brokerdealers that are not in the cse program  that would be any brokerdealer thats in a bank holding company regulated by the federal reserve  our plan is to include an informationsharing arrangement regarding those institutions as well
more broadly the sec would provide us with information on an ongoing basis about the financial condition and risk management internal controls capital liquidity and funding resources of all brokerdealers that are controlled by a bank holding company  this would allow us access beyond what were currently getting right now were getting primarily focus reports on the brokerdealers which are not always the most informative documents  so well get more access  we also are expecting to agree to provide similar kinds of financial and riskmanagement information to the sec again to the extent that the information affects the broker dealer  so we would not be routinely providing information about bank holding companies related to the bank or related to the nonbanking operations that are not brokerdealers  we also are expecting to include a provision that outlines several existing agreements that we have for sharing information regarding some of the clearing companiesdtc in particulartransfer agents municipal securities
dealers and investment advisers  this would simply incorporate without changing the arrangements we already have  an essential part of all this sharing of information is that both agencies would agree to keep the information confidential  in addition the sec is agreeing not to use our exam or supervisory information in particular any opinions that we might have in their enforcement actions or investigations without the permission of the federal reserve
the second part of the agreement as were working through it relates to supervisory expectations for the four large investment banks and for the primary dealers that have access to the pdcf and the tslf  there the current proposal is that the two agencies would agree to collaborate and coordinate with each other in obtaining access to the information on the financial condition of these organizations and in setting supervisory expectations concerning the capital liquidity risk management and funding for the cses and the primary dealers  wed also collaborate and coordinate our communications to those entities about supervisory expectations something thats already begun with art and his group
the memorandum of understanding mou is intended to serve as a bridge from the existing world to whatever brave new world the congress may put together  but it is not tied specifically to the pdcf or the tslf and is intended to last beyond access to those facilities  it also does not change the legal authority that either of the two agencies has  we continue to have full unfettered legal authority over bank holding companies  they continue to have full unfettered authority over the broker dealers  but we do agree to talk more collaborate more and coordinate more  as i mentioned the mou is substantially worked out  we are still though in negotiation over a couple of key points  our goal is to have it done this week we hope with an announcement at the end of the week or sometime next week  we expect that the terms of the mou will be made public  as soon as we have something thats concrete enough well also send that around to you
mr parkinson  thanks  im just going to go over the last few pages of the handout you have pages 13 through 15  page 13 is just a table reminding you who the primary dealers are and providing some basic information about their size borrowing activity and regulatory status  as you probably know there are currently 20 primary dealers although as art mentioned were about to lose two of thembear stearns and countrywide  an important point to note which ran through scotts presentation is that although the investment banksthe four firms that are subject to consolidated supervision by the sec under their cse programare among the largest primary dealers there are some very large bankaffiliated dealers including not only affiliates of us banks but also affiliates of german swiss british and french banks  also if you look at column 3 youll seeand these are data that we get from the two government securities clearing banks that facilitate triparty repo jpmorgan chase and bank of new yorkthat it shows that the investment banks are not in fact the largest borrowers in the triparty repo markets  rather that distinction belongs to deutsche bank banc of america and barclays  i think thats significant because arguably the biggest threat from bears bankruptcy was the impact on the
availability of secured financing especially from money funds and other highly risk adverse investors that provide triparty financing to the dealers  so we have some very large borrowings by those noninvestment bank firms  columns 4 and 5 provide some information about how these firms are regulated  essentially the legal entity itself in every case but one is a brokerdealer regulated by the sec and in that case its a government securities dealer regulated by the treasury but the sec really does the enforcement of those treasury regulations  finally all of these firms except one cantor fitzgerald which is an interdealer broker are subject to some form of consolidated supervision by one or another consolidated regulator although the regimes can differ appreciably  the ots has a regime for countrywide i guess  being a notable example itself quite different from the one that we would apply
so with those facts in mind turn to the next two pages  i dont intend to go through all these questions but what weve done here is set out some issues for discussion  basically there are two sets one relating to the future of our liquidity facilities for the primary dealers and the other relating to the supervisory arrangements through which were seeking to mitigate the moral hazard that those liquidity facilities create  in each case there are questions about what to do under current laws until such time as the congress may change those laws  then there are questions about what legislative changes we might seek particularly if the congress shows an inclination to legislate in this area  our purpose for this list of questions is to stimulate a discussion among you about these important issues and to provide you with an opportunity to express any preliminary views you may have  with that i think wed be pleased to answer questions on any of the three staff presentations
thanks
chairman bernanke  questions for our colleagues  president lacker
mr lacker  thank you  thank you art scott and patrick for a very forthcoming
presentation  two things for you art  first on page 8 you presented some information about the
details of the stress test that youre applying and the table lists various unsecured funding and
secured funding from other sources and you have numerical assumptions for the severity of stress
i take it that you apply those to the balance sheet numbers and do some calculations to calculate the
stress test
mr angulo  correct  we went back to the firms and asked them to give us the
information cut this way because its not readily available from any public information that we
have  we also asked them to give us under a severe test scenario what their assumption was
based on the submissions that we got from the four which we converged and massaged we came
out pretty close to these assumptions  we didnt make these up
mr lacker  i was going to say that you essentially asked the question what does
severe mean in your stress system
mr angulo  we left it somewhat in their hands saying that its going to be short of a
full run
mr lacker  then you had some iteration to get to an agreedupon set of numbers for
these
mr angulo  yes
mr lacker  okay  now you also said that you started your first iteration by asking
them to give you the results of a bear stearns failure scenario  what numbers does that correspond
to on this table
mr angulo  you would have a lot higher numbers on secured funding  you would
have the numbers coming much closer to the illiquid 100 percent and you would have a
mr lacker  well wait  im sorry  i lost you there
mr angulo  under fixedincome finance for example under the secured funding
theres liquid and less liquid  those are 20 percent and 50 percent  those would have been
approaching 100 percent
mr lacker  so the severity thats how much of the money goes away
mr angulo  how much runsexactly
mr lacker  okay  so do you have those numbers for bearwhat they actually
experienced
mr angulo  the sec is working on a post mortem  they have promised to share it
with us when theyre done  they have folksi wouldnt say forensic accountantsin there
looking at that trying to piece together what happened  so we did not have the exact numbers
mr lacker  you didnt have the exact numbers
mr angulo  no
mr lacker  but you knew roughly what they were
mr angulo  things moved pretty quickly at the end
mr lacker  i see  well i was just interested in information on exactly how that
transpired  if theres a chance that you could share with us that information when you get it that
would be very useful  a second question for you  you noted reputational risk from being in on the
supervisory basis and i want just to probe as to how you think about that  what eventualities would
be risky for us
mr angulo  i guess a couple  were saying that were looking at the capital position  i
think governor kohn was careful to say in his testimony that were looking at capital in relation to
nearterm earnings prospects  that gives us kind of a short window but we know from examining
banks that a capital number thats reported to you depends on how youre carrying your assets  we
have not done any work in trying to get behind for example the evaluations on lehmans
commercial real estate portfolio  thats a potential vulnerability there  also we have not really
looked to a consolidated assessment of risk management at these firms something we do in the
bank supervision process  so were basically taking the inputs for lack of a better word at face
value and not doing our own work to try to validate those  thats what i was referring to in terms of
the risk to us  i think as long as were there people expect us to be doing a little more than what
weve been doing to date
mr lacker  so its essentially the risk that after the fact marks are questioned and
they ask you guys were in therewhy didnt you     i understand that  thanks
the third question is for pat  you talked about the repo market  my understanding is that
some supervisory work under the lfi large financial institution umbrella is aimed at conditions in
the repo market and mitigating some risk there  you mentioned that it was obviously an important
factor in bear  to what extent do you think paying interest on demand deposits would obviate the
need for the huge volume of transactions in the repo market and the extent to which that legislative
prohibition could have contributed to the market structures and fragility that gave rise to what
happened in bear
mr parkinson  i cant answer that but thats a good question  i mean the basic
problem here is that you have a tremendous demand for investments that have essentially the
characteristics of treasury bills but the supply of treasury bills isnt nearly as large as that demand
coming from money market mutual funds and from investment of cash collateral on securities
lending and other kinds of secured financing  over time the marketplace has come up with
synthetic treasury bills of various sorts but those shortterm investments have been created outside
the banking system by and large because the inability to pay interest on demand deposits doesnt
allow them to be provided by the banking system  now if that prohibition were removed i think
you would see banks offering things that would be competing with overnight repos overnight
commercial paper and other sorts of things that are outside the banking system that are meeting
these needs
in terms of the effects on stability whether that leaves us in a better place obviously would
depend on how good a job we do of regulating maturity transformation by the commercial banking
system  an interesting question there iswhenever i hear art give his presentation and look at
these stress tests were applying to the investment banks even under current conditions when
theyre not offering overnight interestbearing depositshow well our banks would fare if we
tested them against these standards  but i think your observation and your question are good ones
mr lacker  i mention that because it sounds as though it would be worthwhile
knowing if its important  since weve asked the congress twice now for permission to pay interest
and theyve declined and if this was a factor in the recent crisis we might want to point that out to
them as part of our legislative dialogue with them over the next couple of months to try to get them
to do something
chairman bernanke  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  just a comment on president lackers question  i
guess in the end it would depend on how big bear stearnss balance sheet would have been and
whether paying interest on demand deposits at commercial banks would have somehow shrunk
bear stearnss balance sheet and the secured funding that could then run  so its pretty
complicated  its not obvious to me whether it would have made bear stearns a smaller player and
a less significant part of the market but its interesting  tim looks as though he wants to say yes
it would
vice chairman geithner  no  may i  you know we think that the money funds
finance about a quarter or a third of the stuff in triparty  money funds have a unique type of
liquidity risk  so it is possible if the same set of assets were financed by banks that because banks
have a different liquidity risk the system would be more stable  so you can maybe say even with
the same balance sheets as investment banks and the same mix of illiquid stuff financed through that
mechanism if the banks were the dominant providers of liquidity or it was provided through banks
that the system would be more stable and the broader protections that we designed over the last
century to limit the risk of runs on banks because of the risk to the system might have more power
insulating us from a system where nonbanks are large  i think thats the argument
it would be interesting to know a bit about the politics on the hill of thinking about that
legislative change  it would probably look a little like the middle east i suspect  laughter  that
would be a huge change in the relative return on different types of financial businesses that now
would come with that  but it would be worth knowing a bit about the history of that debate in the
past and what the probability is that we could get something like that through
mr kohn  i also had a question mr chairman and its on the pdcf  i find some
tension in my own attitudes here  your leaning all over these people not to borrow helps protect the
boards decision that this is unusual and exigent credit couldnt otherwise be available and all of
that  so its supportive of that  on the other hand it sounds really like what we used to do with
commercial banks all the time and thought it created stigma in the process  we dont want you to
borrow  if you come in and borrow given that we dont want you to borrow you must really be
hurting to overcome art angulos or bill dudleys frown  so i think the more we do this the less
useful this thing is as a backstop in some sense  i dont know  i dont have an easy answer as to
how to resolve this tension
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman may inot to preempt art and scottin
this case  i completely agree  it is very important not to undermine the value of these liquidity
backstops by introducing stigma in their use until we get to the point at which we want to dial
people back  but the decisions or the actions we took in the context of cantor and countrywide had
a very compelling rationale  it would have been irresponsible for us given the facts that over
cantor we have no comparable framework of supervision and that their exposure was very large
relative to capital  in that context we could do it without any risk that we were going to stigmatize
the use of the pdcf because its a unique thing  countrywide as you know had a slightly different
but similar rationale  it would have been imprudent for us to have had a substantial amount of
securities outstanding insufficiently collateralized in the event that the deal didnt go through
because they were not viable on their own without bank of americas buying them  that was a
necessary and prudent thing to do  i think also that the risk was very limited that we introduced
stigma to the facilities  the barclays thing was more delicate  we would not say to them you
cant use the facility  we just asked some careful questions about what they were doing and why
because their pattern of use was so different from everybody elses in that context  but i completely
agree with your concern about that stuff  i think we must be very careful going forward that we
dont do things that will alter this balance
chairman bernanke  president lacker you had something
mr lacker  yes  about the general topic of stigma and lending at our facilities i think
it would be a useful agenda item for future research and it would be useful for us to work at
thinking carefully about this  stigma represents some information revelation to market participants
attending on some act whether its borrowing from us or from someone else  the usual
presumption is that more information is better  we talk as if stigma is a bad thing  so id want to
see a model that lays out how the sense in which its a bad thing counteracts the sense in which
information is usually a good thing  im really curious about that  i think its something we ought
to think more carefully about
chairman bernanke  president plosser did you have a comment
mr plosser  yes  i asked bill dudley yesterday a question about what i had heard
from the streetthat they perceived that stigma was attached to it  with this conversation it
certainly appears to me that i was hearing them say that at least from the investment banks point of
view they do feel that some stigma is already attached to it good or bad  now that ive heard this
discussion it is consistent with what i was hearing from those wall street firms
mr dudley  may i just interject one thing on this  vice chairman geithner makes the
important point that one issue is counterparty risk for cantor and countrywide which was sort of
separate  the other issue is since this is permissible only under section 133 that it cant be a
chronic source of funding and it cant be part of their core funding plan  we want to make it clear
to them that this is going to go away and we want to be confident that theyre not dependent on the
pdcf as a source of funding  so i would distinguish between barclays coming in occasionally
with barclays coming in every day and thats really the point we were trying to make to them
mr angulo  it may be too fine a distinction but we didnt say no to anyone when
they came in  when they came in and stayed for a month and a half or two months then we started
to say no
vice chairman geithner  but these are very different  im sorry
chairman bernanke  go ahead  finish your sentence
vice chairman geithner  i was just going to say that its a very delicate balance
we want this set of firms to get themselves to the point where in the eyes of the market they have a
more conservative mix of leverage appropriately measured and funding risk so that they are less
likely even in a pretty adverse shock to need to finance illiquid stuff with their central bank as a
defense against that liquidity pressure  were trying to do that without forcing a level of
deleveraging that would be adverse to our broader objectives of trying to get markets back to some
point where theyre functioning more normally  were not going to get that perfect  by definition
our facilities by design should allow them to run with a mix of leverage and liquidity risk that is
above what the market probably now would permit  in the absence of our facilities leverage and
liquidity risk if you measured it on a scale would have to be lower in some sense  but thats the
purpose and the necessary complement of the facility and it is a delicate balance
but just to come back to president plossers point i dont think that the stigma is the result
of how were applying the discretion we preserved for ourselves around use  it is really the result of
the fact that particularly if youre at a point when you perceive escalating concern about your
viability people dont want to risk that their pattern of use if disclosed would magnify the concern
thats really what accounts for the care in use particularly as concern about viability has been
intensified these last few weeks or so
mr dudley  if i could add just one more thing i also think that the stigma doesnt
really undercut the benefit of the pdcf as a backstop to these firms financing  if the stigma really
undercut the benefit then the stigma would be quite important  but i think that the pdcf is still a
very viable backstop even with some stigma associated with it in the current environment
chairman bernanke  president hoenig did you have an intervention
mr hoenig  yes  to follow up on governor kohns point i think its important to our
discussion going forward in terms of how we view these firms from commercial banks to
investment banks and primary dealers because we are lending under exigent circumstances to these
institutions under the primary dealer facility  therefore they almost by necessity should be
concerned about stigma if they were to continue to borrow through there  on the other hand its
important because the taf is a different instrument and has different implications going forward in
how we think about it and whether we want stigma with that  i think about how and how broadly
we view different financial institutions that is investment banks  are they blending into
commercial banks  what about beyond that  we are going to have discussions about other types
of financial institutionsshould they not continue to be lent to only under exigent circumstances
versus an ongoing taf type of arrangement  so i think there is stigma and probably should be
unless we are concluding that theyre more like banks than not like banks
chairman bernanke  were going to have a chance of course for everybody to
give their views  president fisher did you have a question
mr fisher  i just wanted to get in on this point that governor kohn raised  im not
uncomfortable with our being parsimonious with the primary dealer credit facility  it is under
unusual and exigent circumstances and i think we need to be sure that they are unusual and exigent
circumstances  thats the reason it was created and i think we have to respect that  im just
wondering judging from the decline in the extent of the outstandings and given what you described
can we assume that theres a lessening of unusual and exigent circumstances  thats my question
mr angulo  i would defer to my colleagues in markets but i would just give one
anecdote  over the past few weeks in particular when lehman announced its secondquarter
results some observers in the market stated that lehman might not have come through this period if
the pdcf had not been there  they never drew on it  i think its an interesting point  i think there
may be some relevance some truth to that  bill you would have a better sense as to whether the
markets are back to normal or not
mr dudley  i dont think theyre back to normal and i also think very strongly that the
amount of use of the primary dealer credit facility is not a guide to how important it is as a
backstop for financial firms
mr fisher  thats my point  thats important
mr dudley  there were a number of people to whom we talked who said that the
reason they stayed with lehman during this period of stress was that they knew that the primary
dealer credit facility was there as a backstop  so i have a high degree of confidence that lehman
would have been in great difficulty without it
vice chairman geithner  just to make sureit isnt quite as awkward as it sounds
i mean its not clear  the test for us about whether or not these make sense is not fundamentally
about whether the pdcf would save lehman from itself  i would just make the observation that we
thought originally that you could look at the bid to cover and at the clearing price in the auction
facilities as a measure of stress in markets and they would be a test by which you could see
conditions  i think its important to recognize that thats not itself a particularly useful prism on
stress today  independent of the specific circumstance around lehman the people who are funding
triparty balance sheets for better or worse tell anybody who listens that theyre doing so
significantly because of the existence of this facility as a backstop  so the use is not a very good
measure of stress probably because of the stigma around it and because were affecting prices
anyway by the existence of these facilities
were doing as much as we can to improve the odds that these firms get to the point at
which in the eyes of their shortterm secured or unsecured creditors they look as though they can
withstand a pretty large shock in the future without recourse to our facilities  but i dont think
were at the point yet where we can say that confidently not because they havent deleveraged
sufficiently or bought enough liquiditythough theres a bit of that still leftbut because theres so
much uncertainty left still about the scale of pressure on balance sheets what that might do to the
losses what that might do to asset prices going forward or to behavior  so this is just one mans
view but i think a very good substantive case based on what you can observe and what people say
about behavior suggests that circumstances are still so fragile that we could justify the provision of
these facilities as a responsible sensible act given our broader objectives
chairman bernanke  did you complete your questions
mr kohn  yes i did
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i just have a couple of questions of fact  how big was bear stearnss
triparty repo on the thursday that they started getting into troublejust to give a rough sense of
scale  i know its not exact
mr angulo  about 150 billion
mr rosengren  about 150 billion
mr lacker  that thursday
mr dudley  it was a little over 100 billion
mr lacker  it hadnt run off that week
mr dudley  it was starting to run off
mr rosengren  okay  so roughly 100 billion  the numbers seemed to be in that
range  now one of the reasons that were worried about the triparty repo was that the securities in
that triparty repo were very illiquid  was bear stearns unusual in the amount of illiquid securities
that were being financed  as we look down this list is the nature of the triparty repo across these
different parties similar or different  you could have a triparty repo with collateral that would be
easy to liquidate or you could have a triparty repo with something very difficult so that the
counterparty would have a difficult time actually selling it into a distressed market  from the work
you all have been doing are there big differences or not
mr angulo  there are definite differences among dealers  i dont have the bear
stearns cut but we did a cut recently and there are very clearly differences among dealers  as we
know the share of less liquid assets being financed by triparty has been growing over the last
pick a numberfive seven years  the trend line is going like that clearly at a steeper or more
pronounced rate than the growth in more liquid or more eligible collateral
mr plosser  soim sorrywhat percentage would that be  when you say its
growing is it now 10 20 50 or 80 percent
mr angulo  pat do you have that
mr parkinson  i have in front of me data from bank of new york which facilitates
about twothirds of the repos  at bank of new york 18 percent of the collateral is debt thats
settled through dtcso that would be nongovernment nonagency debtand another 6 percent
is equity  so about 25 percent is nonomo things  the biggest chunk by far is agency mbs  of
course i think in extremis bear was having trouble financing even agency debt importantly given
the illiquidity that had developed in even the agency debt markets at that time which was the
critical thing that made investors no longer willing to provide financing for that kind of collateral
with a shaky counterparty
mr rosengren  for bear stearns we have one side of the transaction looking at the
investment banks  on the other side of that transaction you have companies like fidelity schwab
and federated  so as we think about who poses systemic risk we probably want to think about both
sides  in terms of a distress scenario you have triparty repos that are very illiquid  the clearing
bank does not want to provide the cash  as a result they have to liquidate and you have companies
like fidelity schwab and federated having to break the buck and they dont have much capital to
infuse  so just as we think about systemic risk as youre looking at these other organizations are
there other people that you would add to that  i know for bear stearns that fidelity schwab and
federated played a very large role  were there other organizations that we ought to be thinking
about that would have the same kind of nature
mr parkinson  well the other big category that we have been able to identify of
entities that are providing triparty financing is the custodian banks that act as agents for securities
lenders  when someone lends out securities they often take in cash collateral  then they want to
reinvest that collateral and the big bank custodians do that on their behalf and invest a portion of
that cash in triparty  interestingly jpmorgan chase and bank of new york mellon are two of the
big banks involved in that particular business  so thats another category
i think maybe what youre getting at is about dealing with the issues of the triparty market
per se  we have to be very careful in our approach to these issues because the situation is still very
fragile and until we get out of this period of turmoil we first want to do no harm there  but any
solution cant be focused solely or even primarily on the clearing banks and the way they process
these transactions although thats part of it  it also has to focus on the behavior of the borrowers
and the lenders and the borrowers are basically all of these primary dealers and certain other big
brokerdealers  the lenders are more diverse which makes them more difficult to deal with  but i
think there are certainly questions about whether theyre managing their risks effectively  if youre
a money fund and youre treating an overnight repo secured by illiquid collateral as the equivalent
of an overnight treasury bill theres something problematic about that in terms of your own
thinking about the situation youd be in if in fact the borrower were unable to repay
mr rosengren  one last question  sorry for so many questions  the situation of
lehman was kind of interesting because you saw their stock price go down  talking to financial
institutions both regulated and unregulated in boston a lot of people were evaluating counterparty
risk and deciding whether or not they were going to start running before the capital issue  did your
measures of liquidity pick up the amount of stress that was going on in the counterparty analysis
being done i assume all over the country  one of the conditions for an institutions access to the
discount window at a primary credit rate is that it not be rated a 4 or a 5  i know were not doing
bank exams and i know were not looking at all the elements of the bank exam  how confident are
we if we were to do something like that for lehman or for merrill lynch that we wouldnt rate
them a 4 or a 5
mr angulo  on the first question yes we were picking up the pressures on liquidity
we saw some cracking but it never broke  there were some counterparties that were skittish but
we never saw the type of accelerated withdrawals or running that came to mark bear stearns  we
were watching it very closely and so were they  but basically it hung together  the second
question is a very difficult one  it goes back to the point i finished on that we are somewhat
vulnerable in making these assessments without having a more robust process  one way to look at
it in the near term thoughagain as best we can looking at capitalis the chart on page 6  if you
look at lehmanwith its capital raise their tier 1 riskbased capital would be 125 percent  there
may be some range around that  there are certainly questions about how accurately bears capital
was stated  but as a rough measure i think it would be difficult to say that lehman would be a 4 or
a 5 looking at it from a solvency perspective  theyve bolstered liquidity  as i said it started to
crack but it never really shattered
chairman bernanke  governor warsh did you have a question
mr warsh  not a question just for the goround
chairman bernanke  why dont we then have an opportunity for general comments
on these issues  let me just give a bit of context  when we instituted the pdcf and the tslf in
march about the time of the bear stearns event we stipulated that they would be available for up to
six months  that date midseptember is coming closer  its my view and i think others share it
that markets remain fragile and in the case of lehman for example the existence of the backup
was an important support in maintaining the stability of that institution  therefore given the state
of the markets and given that i think we still face some systemic risks i am quite inclined at this
point to ask the board to extend the pdcf and the fomc to extend the tslf over yearend which
is a difficult periodsubject of course to the continued finding of unusual and exigent
circumstances  if we do that i would ask the board to consider that in a board meeting and
depending on the comments today if theres sufficient support i would ask the fomc to do that in
a notation vote later this month
now if we make the announcements that were going to at least provisionally extend these
facilities i think its important that we do so in the context of explaining that we have an exit
strategy  in particular we are working to strengthen supervisory oversight market resilience and
the overall regulatory structure so that there is understanding and confidence that were moving
forward in a way that will over time make this unnecessary not only in the short term but in the long
term as well
there are several parts to the plan here  one as scott already described is the
memorandum of understanding with the sec which will provide the basis for cooperation and
collaboration in the medium term for our oversight of the investment banks  two working with the
sec wed like to push forward along the lines that art was describing go beyond where we are
now and begin to establish a set of supervisory expectations regarding what we expect to see for the
investment banks and to make sure that we have greater confidence in what were doing and what
theyre doing  a third element that i think is important as we go forward is to try to improve the
financial infrastructure in a number of dimensions  a lot of this work is already taking place at the
federal reserve bank of new york working with other regulators and with the private sector  it
includes things like improving the clearing and settlement process for various kinds of derivatives
and improving risk management of derivative positions and counterparty positions for example  it
would be important for us going forward to make sure that major institutions can identify their
exposure to a given counterparty through derivatives and other instruments and be able to close out
that counterparty in an efficient and effective way  in addition work is going on here at the board
and in conjunction with new york on the triparty repo market trying to think of ways that we can
strengthen thatperhaps for example by narrowing the range of collateral that is normally
accepted and through other steps
so the way i would envision this proceeding would beagain with your assent and subject
to your commentsthat we will announce within the next few days the mou agreement with the
sec which i would reemphasize is not tied to the pdcf  that is we would anticipate that this
relationship would continue even should we close those facilities on the grounds that the moral
hazard issue is still there until such time that there is further resolution by the congress  second
ill be giving a speech at the fdic on july 8 followed by testimony on regulatory reform on
july 10 when secretary paulson and i and others will be laying out some broad principles
including some of the issues of infrastructure and will be discussing some of the longerterm
legislative issuesfor example the issue of how we should perhaps normalize or regularize the
resolution of a failing systemically important firm and in so doing maybe define more strictly what
the parameters are for fed lending and what our responsibility is in this kind of situation
so to summarize the mou is this week  there will be testimony coming up  presumably
after the monetary policy testimony later this month we would like conditional on your approval
to announce the extension of these facilities conditional on continuing unusual and exigent
circumstances  we would like to package that with a series of announcements concerning
investment bank expectations infrastructure and as part of this environment as we talk about this in
testimony and so on some of our thoughts about how we might go forward in terms of statutory
change in the future  what im trying to convey is that although i think we need to extend these
facilities we should do it in a context of increasing clarity about how we are working to make them
less and less necessary in the future  so with that as context let me just open the floor for any
comments that people might have  i have first president lacker
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  the issues around the liquidity facility and
what supervisory apparatus we have wrapped around primary dealers have to do with our having
extended our lending reach  i think theres now a substantial gap between our implied lending
commitment and the scope of our supervisory authority  vice chairman geithner spoke very
eloquently about that earlier this month  i think its paramount that we close that gap in order to
keep borrowers from exploiting the obvious lending commitment and choosing to leave themselves
vulnerable to runs and runlike behavior  but this leaves open the question of the extent of our
lending reach and how we close that gap and i think that thats the most critical challenge for us in
the year ahead particularly as we approach negotiations with the congress
id like to share a couple of thoughts on that broader question because the questions posed to
us sort of get at those  its important to start this from a peacetime perspective sort of a timeless
perspective and ask the question as if you were choosing afresh a lending and regulatory policy that
was going to last a long time  if you imagine for the moment that whatever we announce and adopt
would be perfectly credible and immediately viewed as credible i think youd obviously choose to
not have this gap  youd obviously choose to have lending and regulatory policies that are mutually
incentive compatible  so youd want an adequate supervisory regime in place for any institution
that market participants believe well lend to  conversely it means that you would want market
participants to believe that we will constrain our lending to those institutions for which we have an
adequate supervisory regime in place
so then the question comes up  how do you choose the boundaries of our lending
commitment  i take it as selfevident that our lending commitment shouldnt be openended and
unlimited  we dont want to supervise every financial intermediary in the world or in the united
states much less all individuals partnerships and corporations  but even limiting ourselves to
whats called systemically important financial institutions is going to be problematic as well  i take
that phrase to mean any institution whose failure could be costly or disruptive to many other market
participants  any institution that chooses to engage in maturity transformation to some extent faces
the potential for runlike behavior by the creditors  unless we impose draconian regulations market
participants will always have a virtually unlimited capacity for creating financial arrangements that
run the risk of disruptive failures  so extending our lending reach to whatever institution that makes
itself systemically important just leads us down a path of ever more financial regulation of an ever
larger portion of the financial system  i think were going to have to set some boundaries  id like
to see them tighter rather than looser and making them credible is going to be the hard problem for
us going forward
in doing that were going to face a classic timeconsistency problem  i take that as given
im not sure everyone else shares that view but i take it as obvious  inevitably the exigencies of
crisis management are excruciating but i think there are times when they conflict with our longrun
interest in the type of financial system that we would design from a peacetime timeless perspective
just the way shortrun concerns about growth sometimes conflict with our longrun interest in price
stability  but just as sustaining monetary policy credibility sometimes requires resisting the
temptation to ease policy to stimulate growth sustaining credible lending limits is going to
sometimes require not preventing a disruptive failure of an institution and not ameliorating the cost
of financial distress  to put it another way i think it would be a mistake to adapt our supervisory
reach to a purely discretionary lending policy  were going to have to choose a policy and commit
to it and then take hard actions to make that credible
from this point of view i have a deep question about the questions posed by the staff  they
focus entirely on primary dealers and it doesnt strike me that the fact that bear stearns was a
primary dealer was what made us lend  it was the fact that it was more disruptive  i think its likely
that any other institution that presents the same threat of a disorderly resolution is going to be
perceived as benefiting from our implicit lending support whether or not theyre a primary dealer
unless we say something otherwise unless we draw a boundary and unless we make that credible
so for example other large brokerdealers hedge funds private equity firms or insurance
companies could easily fail in a disruptive way  we need to think through whether were going to
let that happen or whether were going to be forced to step in  at some point were going to have to
choose to let something disruptive happen
i think that ambiguity about our lending limits would be a bad choice  market participants
are going to form their own views about the likelihood of us lending  any lack of clarity about the
boundaries is just going to lead some firms to test the boundaries and its not going to help us resist
the temptation to lend beyond the boundaries we want to establish  besides mr chairman youve
emphasized the value of depersonalizing and institutionalizing the conduct of monetary policy  its
important that we strive for lending policy that isnt critically dependent on particular officeholders
as i said id favor fairly tight limits on our lending commitments and you are probably not
surprised about that  i think we really ought to maintain this section 133 hurdle at a fairly high
level but the exit strategy makes me nervous  crafting this mou a permanent shift in our visibility
into and in our ability to protect the system from primary dealers is just going to sustain the
expectations that have arisen since bearwhich have been described and referenced a couple of
times and which you see in the fall in cds spreads for those institutionsand it is just really hard
to see how to put that genie back in the bottle and limit the extent to which were viewed as
backstopping them  but i think we ought to strive to make that somehow be viewed as unusual as
possible
more broadly my reading of the history of economics and financial intermediation is just
my reading  but im motivated broadly by the sense that wed be better served in the long run with
as small an extent of central bank lending commitment as possible  central bank credit is fiscal
policy  it entangles us in politics  it risks compromising the independence of our monetary policy
youve heard me say this before  expanding our lending forces us to extend our regulatory reach
and that cant be good for the financial system even though i trust our staff to do a very good job of
being as efficient and effective as they can be  ive argued this before  its not obvious on the
evidence that our financial system is terribly fragile apart from the volatility induced by
uncertainties about government and central bank policies  besides i think that we should take
seriously the notion that some amount of financial instability is undoubtedly optimal as work by
economists such as allen and gale has demonstrated  those are the kinds of considerations that i
think ought to guide our policy
finally mr chairman a word about process  at our last meeting we discussed interest on
reserves a historic and consequential decision for us  we had a briefing package of 100plus pages
reflecting substantial staff work  the committee very much benefited from that  at an upcoming
meeting were going to talk about inflation dynamics another consequential topic  weve received
somewhat less material even going back several months about financial markets their character
and the welfare economics of our interventions  id urge you to consider a special topic at some
future meeting at which we explore the economics of financial stability since it is becoming such a
consequential part of what we do  related to that i was happy to learn from art that an afteraction
review by the sec was under way  because our role is different from the secs id like to suggest
that maybe building on that or maybe in parallel to that we conduct our own afteraction review of
the factors that went into how that event played out  thank you very much mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  i agree with you that we need to define limits but
i think we have stronger tools than just our declarations of piety  i would just note that there are
models  one good model is the fdicia model for example which lays out a whole set of criteria
under which intervention can be taken and if intervention is taken has a set of rules  there are
ways through the legal structure to solve some of these problems without our necessarily having to
make timeinconsistent promises
mr lacker  i agree and those are mechanisms for legislatively tying our hands and
that ought to be high on the agenda
chairman bernanke  well discuss those  yes president plosser
mr plosser  on that point i have been reading a bit recently  it might be useful in
thinking about some of these issues about how we tie our hands and the mechanism for doing that
the imf went through an extraordinary study effort during the sovereign debt crisis and came up
with some very important mechanisms for how to change the contracts that were being written by
sovereign countries so as to avoid the imfs having to step in and look for other solutions which is
i think along the same lines  i dont know whether or not there are things from which to learn in
parallel with that to think about how we approach that issue
chairman bernanke  president rosengren
mr rosengren  i have three comments for the long term and three comments for the
short term  for the long term in the tradeoff between focusing on markets versus institutions to the
extent that we can have standardized products traded on exchanges we dont need to spend as much
time with institutions and that takes care of a lot of the counterparty risk  to the extent that the
products have to be customized and done in dealer markets then we have counterparty risk and that
becomes an issue  so i applaud what the new york fed is doing with the credit default swap
market in thinking about a way to more systematically reduce counterparty risk  i wonder if we
should more forcefully be trying to push it not only to a clearinghouse but also maybe to exchange
traded  i know there is a tradeoff between standardized products and nonstandardized products
but if we can get things to be more standard so that they can trade on an exchange we wont have
to spend as much time talking about some of the issues that weve been talking about  not just a
credit default swap market has that characteristic  so if we can push a number of areas in which
theres counterparty risk into an exchange then we can get out of the business of focusing on all the
institutions
the second point is that theres a broader role for us as a holding company supervisor
when i look at this list and look at countrywide its not because theyre a primary dealer that i
would be focused on them  its because they were 20 to 25 percent of the residential mortgage
market they were a very large player  the ots has holding company supervision over them  we
ought to ask ourselves whether now is the time to think about what organizations we ought to have
holding company responsibility for  the ots has wamu and had countrywide  we ought to give
some thought to that  now is the time to think about whether or not thats appropriate and push for
it if there are going to be legislative recommendations  in terms of brokerdealers i think the same
thing applies  i dont think that we should be the primary regulator for these organizations  but if
were going to be lending to them in exigent circumstances having holding company regulatory
authority does become important
the third point is that when you look at this list there are a lot of foreign institutions  one
insight that weve gotten is that an organization as big as ubs could potentially fail  that may not
be something that we thought was very likely nine months ago but it is obviously more likely now
than we would have anticipated  foreign organizations can either establish themselves as a branch
or have a domestic holding company  to the extent that foreign supervisors decide to wall off their
organizations around their geographic borders and say that if there is a problem were not going to
support institutions that are in the united states and youre on your own i think we need to revisit
some of our rules on how much capital we expect foreign holding companies that are intermediary
holding companies to hold  we might also want to think about if theres a lot of activity being
done through a branch that has no capital supporting it how concerned we should be about that
should we be taking actions to make sure that if the foreign parent decides that they are going to
abandon the branch we feel very comfortable with that outcome  given the list of the primary
dealers i think the numbers are fairly large larger than they were for bear stearns and thats
something that we probably should give a bit more thought to
on the shortterm issues i certainly think that we should extend the facilities past the end of
the year  that makes perfect sense  a number of us have made the point that the markets are still
fragile  just the announcements about lehman brothers over the last month highlight that were not
yet safe and i think that it makes perfect sense to extend through the end of the year because there
could be an endoftheyear financing problem this year  second narrowing triparty repo collateral
also makes sense  but it has implications for what securities people hold and some of those
markets may become much more distressed if we announce that they no longer can be part of a tri
party repo  so we need to give some thought to whether there will be collateral damage and to the
unintended consequences from that  third i agree with president lacker that primary dealers
wouldnt be where id focus  id focus on systemically important  that would be key players and
key markets whose failure might cause a cascading of counterparty failures  i think we ought to
start with that premise and which organizations fit into that category  some of them will be on the
primary dealer list but they are on the primary dealer list for a reason very different from the reason
they are systemically important  so maybe distinguishing between those two would be useful
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig
mr hoenig  mr chairman on the short term i think extending through the end of the
year is prudent and would support that  i would say that the possibility of its naturally dying off
would be ideal  i would support that because it is exigent circumstances  we should make that
clear and work these people out of it as quickly as possible
on the longerterm issues i share the view of a lot of what president lacker said  a couple
of things  im very uneasy about extending our lending and supervisory authority to these
institutions on the basis of systemic risk  the banking industry has been under our umbrella
importantly around transactions activitiesthat is paymentsand how important they are
systemically  its clear and a line is there  beyond that it is size thats systemically important  if
we extend this and institutionalize it because weve had this emergency and weve used section
133 then i have to ask what will happen when the next longterm capital occurs thats larger
more complicated with a lot more interaction that will affect the markets globally  what will we
do  to what then will we extend ourselves in terms of supervisory oversight memos of
understanding agreements for the group of hedge funds that arent regulated and so forth  so i
think its important that we focus on the fact that this is an emergency and that we go back to
exigent circumstances in the future for these institutions so that we have clear boundaries on that
i think it has served us well and will continue to serve us well  then we use our best judgment in
exigent circumstances and very sparingly  i think thats a lot of what president lacker said so i
wont repeat everything else but those are the concerns that i really do have going forward
chairman bernanke  thank you
vice chairman geithner  may i make a suggestion
chairman bernanke  a suggestion
vice chairman geithner  yes  you know these are deep consequential questions
we face  this is a question on the economy and were not going to resolve it today  i think its
important that we recognize that were going to have to build some time into our agendalater this
year probably certainly early next yearand get deeper into the basic question about what we are
for in the future  what amendments to the federal reserve act if any would we support  what
would we resist  what mix of these things  thats important because were not going to do an
adequate job of getting ourselves on the table on those actions today  we are going to need to be
very careful that the stuff were doing in the here and now doesnt prejudice those decisions long
term  again i think the package that the chairman laid out and the strategy we have are pretty
carefully designed to mitigate that risk  were trying to be very careful that were preserving full
optionality once we get through this particular period to go on any of the paths that are ahead in
this context  of course this shortterm stuff is vulnerable to the risk  it looks as though were
prejudicing some of those choices but i think were trying to be careful not to do that  i just wanted
to make the point that were all going to need a little time to think through this stuff and were
going to need some time to come back and talk about the deeper policy questions that we face in
this because they are very consequential  i have a lot of sympathy for all the concerns that are on
the other side of where we are today
mr hoenig  i would very much like to see us make that happen sooner rather than later
just because of the force of events taking us forward
chairman bernanke  thats right  because of testimonies and so on we are
going to have to at least enunciate some broad principles and that is why this discussion is very
useful  obviously details will be worked out over a longer period  president bullard
mr bullard  yes i just have a few comments  in reading through this memo and
hearing the presentation this morning i think that these are fantastic questions  they deserve a
lot of research and analysis  just to echo vice chairman geithner they cannot easily be
answered in a forum like this one  what is happening is that we start out looking at these
questions which just spawn more and more questions so we end up with an even longer list of
questions  the shortterm strategy seems perfectly reasonable somehow tied to an exit strategy
maybe next year  so i didnt have any problems with that as outlined by the chairman
when we get down to approaching a more detailed analysis of what we want to do
overall it brings up very difficult questions of what the optimal regulatory environment is  i
think that we all think the regulatory environment in the united states is not optimal right now
also in a world of increasing globalization it is not so clear how you should set up your
regulatory structure  this is a onceinageneration chance to possibly reformulate the regulatory
structure  i wouldnt hold my breath on that  i think the congress does not have a great record
of dealing with issues like this  these issues are complicated and it is very hard to get
agreement on them  but you would like to have a benchmark  i think that one is out there in the
economics literature about what that environment should look like  that is what we could
possibly work on over the next nine months or so
then i have another comment  when we are evaluating these programs we have to think
about whether these programs have been effective and to what extent  how do we measure
success  one of the comments earlier was that the mere existence of the programs might be
success in some sense  in a model that is going to work  even if you take it out of existence
because the market knows its there and you can put it back into existence in the future it will
have exactly the same effect  whether or not you have the program in place the equilibrium is
going to be the same in a lot of models so the effects would still be there  if it is just the
potential of putting the program in place that is considered successful then maybe it is not
critical whether it is in place but priced not to be used or whether it is actually taken out of
existence temporarily
chairman bernanke  president fisher
mr fisher  mr chairman i am in favor of keeping these facilities open through year
end as you have suggested  i think that just the existence of the pdcf is important which we
talked about earlier and your overall outline of an approach the topography of that approach is
attractive  the question i have is aboutand you used the termsupervisory expectations  i
have a question for scott and then a thought to follow up on  since scott no one asked you a
question i want to ask you a question
mr alvarez  i was perfectly content to get through this without any questions
laughter  but i am happy to answer anything
mr fisher  in working up this mou have you had any interaction with chairman
frank or any of his staff getting a sense of how they might react or what it does in terms of their
own expectations
mr alvarez  well we have had a bit of interaction on the senate side  the senate
folks are very interested in what we are doing and whether this would preempt a congressional
action  chairman frank has been more sanguine about our doing what is appropriate to deal
with the situation nowlaricke may speak to this more at the lunchtime conversation  but we
are building on existing authority  we are not expanding beyond the existing framework  we
are agreeing to collaborate more work together more but we dont gain any legal or statutory
authority through this mou  we gain some admission because we are standing next to the sec
we expect that the primary dealers and cses will be more willing to talk with us because we are
with the sec  but in the end it depends on voluntary cooperation by all
mr fisher  are you picking up any signals in return in this interaction with the
senate or elsewhere about what they might be thinking  are we picking up any other signals
that might be of concern
mr alvarez  on the house side chairman frank is thinking of a model that is
similar to what the treasury blueprint outlined where the federal reserve would be a systemic
regulator and have some authorities that go along with that  i think that on the senate side they
are very much in disarray  they want to visit this issue but they havent figured out exactly
what point of view they want to have
mr fisher  i am a little confused  you testify in july and then have a speech  you
said that you and paulson will be speaking  i think that is a very important point  it is going to
be a tough act because you dont want to take anything off the table but you want to keep a lot
open and not show your hand  well we dont know what our hand is yet  you may but i dont
think we have it as a group  so we cant really show our hand  anyway i dont know how this
is going to be prepared but im sure there are lots of feelings around this table  this is the
substance that vice chairman geithner referred to earlierthese very very important questions
but you are going to have to show some leg during that speech  obviously this is a board issue
but with regard to the fomc i would just ask that it be fairly carefully vetted
chairman bernanke  i was planning to do that
mr fisher  yes sir  just for some suggestions for whatever theyre worth  thank
you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  president stern
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  just a few points  with regard to the short
term plan of extending the facilities over the turn of the year and so forththat is the mou and
the testimony that goes with itthat is all fine with me  i dont have any problem with that
that sounds sensible under the circumstances
a number of important points have already been raised  i wont reiterate all of them
maybe the one that caught my attention most completely was president lackers point about
credibility  whatever we go forward with obviously has to be seen as credible and as he pointed
out it is important that at some point to limit our involvement in supporting institutions and
markets going forward we may have to be prepared to let one large institution fail  the reason
of course that we are very concerned about protecting them over time is the spillover effect  as
i have said many times before where we need to concentrate our effortsnot necessarily
exclusively but certainly in partis in devising ways to limit spillovers  that is all about
preparationthe analysis and so forth that goes with itand it is all about communicationthat
is putting uninsured creditors on notice that the regime is in fact in the process of changing
now having said that i dont mean to suggest that it is easy  i dont mean to suggest
that we will get it 100 percent correct  but if we dont do those kinds of things then statements
about boundaries arent likely to be credible  they are just going to be well you guys wish it
were this way but you have section 133 and we know its there and we are going to act
accordingly  so i think it is very important as we go forward with this that we focus some
attention exactly on those areas
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen
ms yellen  i will be very brief mr chairman  i do want to say with respect to the
shortterm issues that i fully support the plan that you laid out  i certainly favor keeping these
facilities in place beyond september  even if their use diminishes i agree with the point that it
doesnt necessarily indicate that they are not playing a tremendously important role  the
ramping up of our oversight of these institutions in the agreement with the sec is a very
important part of continuing these facilities
on the longrun issues it is a wonderful list of questions  i dont know the answers to the
questions  i think we really need to dig in very rapidly and do serious work on them  they are
fundamental  president rosengren raised a list of issues about this the same ones that have been
very much in my mind  what institutions  it is not obvious to me that the right list of
systemically important institutions is the primary dealers  i think someonemaybe president
rosengrenraised the issue of countrywide a huge mortgage company  i certainly worried last
summer that it had created systemic risk and it is not just the primary dealer there  i also think
there is an issue with respect to hedge funds similar to those that arose with longterm capital
management  this raises very troubling issues to me about our trying to identify and take on
supervision of all systemically important institutions  this is a very tough issue that i dont
know the answer to
but also what is going on raises fundamental issues about how we conduct consolidated
supervision  even if all the systemically important institutions were primary dealers or mortgage
companies within bank holding companies that currently we do have umbrella supervision over
i am not at all convinced that the way we are carrying out supervision now would have prevented
a bear stearnstype of episode within an institution that is currently solidly under our
supervision  last summer i was pleased in some ways that we had lost direct supervision of
countrywide to the ots  but it might well have been in our domainsix months earlier it
would have beenand it could have created a systemically important problem if it had failed
so just the nature of how we carry out this fedlite approach is that really the right way  i see
us as very focused on process in our supervision of holding companies  we dont do a lot of
transaction testing  obviously this raises very fundamental issues even within our existing
domain about how we carry out comprehensive umbrella supervision  i dont have any answers
but we clearly need to get on it quickly
chairman bernanke  president plosser
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  i will be very brief  a lot of my views have
been shared already  just to expand on president rosengrens commenthow we define the
right institutions the scope of this i think that some of the questions here are really hard  it is
my understanding that the workgroups we talked about last time are going to be working on
some of these things and we need to get those well under way to help us define these problems
on the longerterm problemvice chairman geithner made this point and i just want to
reiterate itit is really important in the short run that we not do things that constrain our longer
term options  it is a very slippery slope that the long run ends up being transformed into a series
of shortterm steps and by that almost inevitably you end up in places you dont want to be  so i
just want to make sure that we stay abreast of that and not let that happen to usthat we find
ourselves six months from now in a position where gee we wish we hadnt done that  so i just
wanted to stress that again
im fine with extending the facilities through the end of the year  i dont have any
tremendous problem with that although i have always been a little puzzled by unusual and
exigent circumstances  what does that really mean  how do we define that  it would be a lot
easier for me to think about when to take it off if i knew what the criteria were for putting it on
it would be helpful to me anyway if we could work on defining those criteria a little more
rigorously  i know there will be judgment involved in that at the end of the day  i dont disagree
with that  but it would help us to define what we mean by that because it is going to be really
hard to define what we mean by a systemically important institution  i am not sure i know the
answer to that  i think it is a very difficult question  so i am okay on the short run
i will just reiterate the other point that president stern made about the issue of credibility
and commitment  you know i have talked a lot about this over the last couple of years
regarding monetary policy  it applies equally well in this framework  figuring out ways to
implement our policies whatever they may be in both a timeconsistent and committed way and
defining those boundaries and how we live up to them is a really hard problem  but i dont
think we can avoid dealing with it and it is going to be a critical piece of how we think about the
longer term  i will just leave it at that
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i also support extending our lending
facilities to get through the yearend funding problems  as many others have already said i
agree that we should undertake an evaluation of the changes to our emergency liquidity facilities
i think it is important that we do it more broadly and that we dont do it in a piecemeal fashion
how the pieces fit together matters greatly  any extension of fed authority to provide routine
liquidity support beyond insured banks should be something that we consider as part of a
comprehensive regulatory and financial safety net reform  my own view may be that i prefer a
narrower lending facility than i think was envisioned in some of the documents that we received
but i do think that the top priority is to have a wellthoughtout documented plan for how we
move forward  that will help us address some of the moral hazard issues that we have been
concerned about  i think it will avoid our having to create any new institutions or new facilities
to respond to future crises  i also think it will help better define some of the boundaries  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart
mr lockhart  thanks mr chairman  i have maybe a variation on governor
warshs comment of yesterday  much has been said by many so i will try not to take too much
time here  i think vice chairman geithners admonitions are correct and i certainly support
them  i am quite supportive of extending through the yearend and the shortterm plan that the
chairman laid out seems quite sensible to me
i dont have wellinformed or wellthoughtout answers to the more detailed questions
that were posed in advance of the meeting  i didnt devote the time to study them in any depth
so let me take refuge in some sort of highlevel comments  a number of people around the table
have been expressing overview types of comments  i see the touchstone of all of this to be our
perceived accountability for systemic risk and financial stability  there may be in the context of
legislation regulation and so forth limits to that but i think that we are largely perceived as the
most accountable party  i have to ask myself do we have a system today that is aligned with the
reality of the financial markets  or put in more vernacular terms do we have the right stuff to
do what we need to do to take responsibility as best we can for financial stability  my answer to
that is no  i dont think we have the right stuff  i think the answer to that lies in working out
the details of what the right stuff is  but the reality is that financial markets are not bankcentric
any longer with the widely discussed shadow banking system including hedge funds a
complexity that is not going to go away international integration that is not going to go away
very lets just say compelling economic and financial reasons for offbalancesheet treatment of
various kinds of things and on and on  we could make a long list of what that reality is  to me
and i have been kind of dwelling on this for some time that is a reality that is likely to continue
it may take a couple of steps back but it will continue to develop along certain lines  do we
have a system that is aligned with it  the answer to that is no  so if we can take care of the
shortterm plan and then buy the time over the next several months to hammer out what we think
is the best possible thinking opposite that reality then that is what i believe we need to be doing
so thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i will also try to be brief in spite of the large
number of questions that were handed out  the short term should be quite easy  on the tactical
issues i agree with the suggestion of extending the facilities through yearend  they seem to
have worked well  also a number of very interesting and important initiatives are ongoing as
well on the cds overthecounter market and triparty repo and those should help out as well
on the longerterm issues i am very happy to hear that you will be giving a speech and
testimony on this and i will be looking forward to how you lay out those issues  obviously
there are largescale changes in our regulatory environment that are being contemplated  these
happen only every now and then  it is an opportunity to improve or to make a tremendous
mistake if we are not very careful  so i think it obviously requires a tremendous amount of
time
people have talked about the various issues so i wont dwell on them  i think there have
been a lot of very good comments around the table and speeches that have laid out the important
issues that we are facing  one that i am sure we will have to talk a bit more about is that we
cant think about this in a static environment  obviously the markets are very dynamic  as
soon as we lay out a structure that will help out certain types of institutions then there is going to
be an opportunity to arbitrage that  we are presumably talking about reducing earnings of a
number of institutions and so they will be seeking those out  another way to characterize the
big questionit is nothing newis how we maintain the incentives for market discipline  many
of the comments that president stern and others made about how we think about preparing for
possible resolutions will be very important  so i am looking forward to many more discussions
about this  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i think i would just like to dig into some of the
comments that president lockhart and president evans just made just for a second take a step
back and ask why we are here having this conversation  i know the timing is because we have
this pdcf but what happened was that the financial markets evolved in such a way that simply
having a liquidity backstop for commercial banks was not sufficient to protect the economy from
systemic risk  i myself have been very surprisedi will be very open about thisat the
persistence the extent the depth and the spread of this crisis and how long it went and what it
covered  every couple of months i thought it was about to be over and then another wave
would come  i think that we have learned something about the financial system in the process
and we have learned that the regulatory structure and the liquidity provision structure were not
sufficient to give the economy the protection it needed from the new style of financial system
that is really the background of why we are here not just because we made the loan or we set up
the facilities because we thought we needed to do so to protect the system under the
circumstances
i completely support mr chairman your suggested path forward for the nearto
intermediate term  i think that is the right way to go  i would say relative to the two senators
that i testified in front of last week that they were very supportive of the memorandum of
understanding between the fed and the sec and particularly supportive of the efforts that the
federal reserve bank of new york and the other regulators are leading to strengthen the
infrastructure of the otc derivatives markets  we didnt get into triparty repos fortunately
but im sure they would have been supportive of that too
i think everybody has raised very good questions about where in this new financial
system you draw the boundaries  what do you need to do  there are no easy answers here and
i look forward to coming back to this  my goingin position is that our liquidity facilities outside
of commercial banks ought to be available in systemic circumstances not in just any
circumstances and they ought to be available at this point to just brokerdealers or investment
banks  i would hesitate to get outside that realm  those guys are already regulated and so what
were talking about is strengthening the regulation  i think that we can strengthen the core of the
system to make it resilient to things happening outside but i am not totally dug in on that  so i
look forward to more discussion  it is going to be very hard to draw the line and make it
credible  i agree partly this will be defining what we mean by systemic but i dont think we
will ever really get to the point of having a bright line around that  it will always need a great
amount of judgment combined withas you said mr chairmana process by which you make
that decision to help limit the moral hazard  crises are always difficult  you get into a crisis
and the nearterm costs are much more palpable than the longterm costs that might be there  so
it is always hard to say no  we have said no in the past on certain circumstances  drexel is
the obvious example  markets were a little stressed  there was a little disorder  it was fine but
it was a very different circumstance  i think that completes my remarks  thank you mr
chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me make a few prefatory comments and
then try to answer a couple of the key questions in the memo  first a crisis is a terrible thing to
waste  my sense is that we have an opportunity here to do the right thing over the period to try
to get market disciplineto charlies pointback and vibrant and working countercyclically
with regulatory discipline and capital standards  so this is an opportunity  as we contemplate
our sixmonthsandaday problem what do we do between september and yearend  i agree
with vice chairman geithners comment that we need to keep options open and i will make a
proposal in a moment for how to do that
second the memo from the staff said that improvements in financial markets have
resulted importantly from the availability of the special liquidity facilities and i agree with that
but i wouldnt give short shrift to the other things that have been going on in the markets that
have improved market functioning  i dont think it is fair to say that we deserve a
disproportionate amount of credit for what has happened  we have seen a ton of capitalraising
we have seen a lot of diversification of funding sources  we have seen changes in duration by
financial institutions  we have seen improved disclosure and transparency  we have seen big
writedowns  we have seen brutal changes in management teams  we have seen pairing of
business lines and improved risk management  so it strikes me that market discipline is alive
and well  it was necessary for us to do what we did but i think it hangs way too much on our
facilities if we suggest that we are the only thing that is keeping the system together
as a final prefatory comment the memo says that some investors have indicated their
willingness to lend to primary dealers in recent months and that has been conditioned on
dealers access to the pdcf  it strikes me that proves too much  i am not sure that is a good
thing  the concerns we have late in the cycle when we look back include that market discipline
broke down  in the short term obviously we want to see some of the money market mutual
funds from president rosengrens neck of the woods hang in there with these institutions so we
dont have a sort of panic coming  but over the short to medium term we want the guys in
money market mutual funds to recognize that when they are providing funding overnight they
are making an investment decision that has a risk  so i hesitate to suggest that we want to do
things over the period that let them be complacent  we want to do things that make them very
focused on the decisions they are making
now a bit to the key questions that were asked in the memo  first on liquidity facilities
on the question of the pdcf and its symmetry with the tslf i like that notion of the balance of
having an auction and having one that is available more regularly  but we have to recognize that
the pdcf whether intended or not has been stigmatized  if lehman brothers when they were
on their darkest day had answered the question differently i dare say they might not be in
existence  they were asked have you accessed the pdcf  the answer was absolutely
not  if their answer to that had been yes i suspect that they and we could have been in a very
different circumstance  so what does that prove  i think that proves that the existence of these
facilities matters  it keeps institutions in the game  the particular terms matter less  but also in
extremis accessing that facility unlike the securities lending facility causes losing a
considerable amount of control over ones own fate  so i think we have to take that into
consideration
we have considerable leverage over these institutions at this time  no matter what they
and their lobbyists say they want us to be their regulator more than they can possibly contain
themselvesmostly for our credibility and mostly for our balance sheet  i worry that if we
extend the pdcf as is by just punting it down the road some months we will lose some of that
leverage  so one idea which i must say i havent explored as much as i probably should is
extending the pdcf not as is but by modifying it in a way that would make bagehot proudby
making it more expensive by widening the spread  now there are other things we could do in
this shortterm extension that modify its termschanging collateral or changing haircuts  but it
strikes me that price might be an interesting way to say listen we arent prejudging outcomes
but you can see from this move that we arent comfortable with the status quo and we are asking
ourselves these very hard questions that we brought to bear  that could send an important
signal which i dont think would be overly disruptive to the markets if we explained some of the
rationale for doing it
let me turn finally to the prudential supervision questions  i have a note here in answer
to the first question how do we limit moral hazard if we continue the facilities  my bold
answer is carefully so i guess not much is there  on what principles should supervisory
expectations be based  i think art talked rightly about these different regulatory frameworks for
the big money center commercial banks and the investment banks  wed be doing ourselves a
disservice over the period mr chairman to take the regulatory regime that we have now had for
a long time for these big complex commercial banks and try to put it on the investment banks
ill answer this the way i began  we have an opportunity to start with a blank sheet of paper
with four institutions over the period and figure out how to be really really good regulators
building on the lessons that we have learned from our traditional supervision and regulation
function  i think that we would be making a mistake by saying we have a model and lets
throw it on these guys  if we regulate these four institutions the way we have long been
regulating commercial banks with the occ and others i think we wont have maximized the
best of regulation  the goal would be to figure out how to regulate these four right and then
frankly to export those lessons to what we have long been doing to make regulation better and
stronger across this group  if it turns out that we do to goldman sachs and morgan stanley what
we have been doing to citi and jpmorgan as was suggested we will find other people will be in
the business of investment banking so we wont have done terribly much to mitigate systemic
risk
finally on the question about the role for the congress  both in the medium term mr
chairman in the context of your speeches and as we get toward the end of july when you
announce some modificationif the fomc agreesabout these facilities and the pdcf it is
very important that the congress be given serious responsibility for this  it has been very easy
for them to criticize on the one hand and to whisper to us all their support on the other  i think
they need to be given very important homework assignments in terms of what they can do
some form of fdicia with investment banks might be one example  wrestling about these
issues in terms of regulatory organizations strikes me as very consequential  even if we could
convince ourselves that we have all the regulatory authority to figure this out with our regulators
we would be better off when we are ready and we have the right answer in our own view to
bring it to the congress for final clarity and to get their imprimatur  thank you mr chairman
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i agree with a lot of what governor warsh
said and a lot of what has been said before  let me just take a slightly different tack answering
the question that governor kohn raised  why are we here  part of that is because of the glass
steagall act we have this unusual structure in the united states  other central banks can
provide credit much more easily to a wide variety of institutions  we have a legacy that created
this separation which isnt as strong in most other countries  in continental europe for
example you just dont really see this  then we have built a regulatory regime that helped to
promote that  remember the discussions have been about markets and the challenges in the
markets  well i think our regulatory regime not just in the united states but throughout the
world helped promote the disintermediation to promote greater reliance on the markets  in
certain ways this is a very good thing but it creates exactly the kinds of problems and challenges
that we are facing now
i think we need to be mindful of that and take that into account when we are thinking
about what to do next in dealing with these issues  thinking about market resiliency and market
infrastructure is crucial but we also have to be mindful that if we try to get things to migrate to
the exchanges to clearinghouses et cetera it is great for us as regulators and it is also useful
because the information is much more centralized  but it also could create market dynamics as
president evans said that could lead to trying to get around that  then the risky stuff goes otc
the risky stuff is in new institutions that we havent thought of yet  president yellen mentioned
some other institutions  we can mention hedge funds and money market mutual funds but in
five years there may be institutions that we havent even thought about  no matter what
structure we set up there would be ways to try to get around it  so we need to think about a
regulatory regime that gets the costs and benefits right to make the different relevant institutions
not bridle too much at being part of it and so to rethink the financial holding company structure
if the investment banks had found the financial holding company structure an amenable one
then we wouldnt be here either because we would have solved the glasssteagall legacy
problem  but we havent quite done that
so actually exactly as governor warsh was sayingand believe it or not we didnt
coordinate beforehandi think that we should think about how to revise our general regulatory
structure to get more institutions under this umbrella not have them find it scary upsetting or
disturbing but to see that we are doing it in a reasonable costbenefit way  i can see just in all
the issues that we have been facing regarding some capital relief in particular circumstances
socalled 2380 relief on particular types of transactions issues of whats included in the
definition of a leverage ratio  i think it gives us an opportunity to rethink why so many
institutions find it onerous and are so lacking in desire to be part of this regime  obviously there
is some regulatory competitionpresident rosengren i think brought that upso we need to
think of that as a whole  this is part of the homework assignment that the congress needs to
think aboutsetting up a reasonable fdicialike regime for a broader set of institutions that
would choose to come and be regulated by the fed
we have been talking about where the bright lines are  but if we okay someone to be a
financial holding company then they become part of our regime in the existing structure  so the
lines arent completely carefully drawn  it really is sort of a costbenefit analysis if someone
chooses to apply  so we need to think about that carefully and about the costs and benefits of
getting people in because the longterm dynamics will be that people always try to get away from
regulation unless they see that there is some sufficient benefit  being very mindful of that both
from the institution context and the broader context of the markets is very important  thank
you
chairman bernanke  thank you
mr kroszner  oh and i apologizei fully support going ahead with extending the
facility past the yearend  i would make sure that its a bit more than just immediately past year
end and go some time into february so there are no questions about yearend
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i also strongly support the shortterm
strategy that was laid out by the chairman  i dont see that we really have an alternative in that
context  there are a lot of issues here  the reality is that this is super complex and we have a
lot of work over the next year to be ready for the next administration when all these issues are
going to become extremely relevant
in general terms regarding the longterm issues although we got here under exigent
circumstances in a financial disruption we might have gotten here anyway  the reality is that
there was a fundamental change in the way the financial system works  when banks are not so
dominant the distinction between investment banks and commercial banks in terms of the way
the financial system works is really much less  it would be nice to think that we could limit the
kinds of lending facilities that we have so that we didnt have to worry about regulating or
supervising other institutions but i dont think that is realistic  the nature of the changes in the
financial system means that we extended the government safety net but it probably would have
been extended anyway  it was just unfortunate that it had to happen in such a crisis atmosphere
so i think we have to think very hard about the issue of limiting moral hazard in terms of a much
wider range of institutions
i am very sympathetic to the issues that president stern raised which is that we have to
think about the kind of things that we have thought about more in terms of the banking industry
how do we actually set things up so that it is easier for firms to fail and not be systemic  there
are a smaller number of firms that we actually have to supervise and regulate and the reality is
that we have to think very hard about how were going to extend regulation and supervision to a
wider range of firms  we just cant escape that  it would be nice to say that we could limit it
but we are not going to be able to limit it except to the extent that we can think about some of
these issues  but it is going to be a huge issue going forward and we really have to be ready to
deal with the political process
the way we are proceeding makes a lot of sense  it is not committing us in a way that
creates a problem but we have to be ready when this issue is dealt with  it will be one of the
hottest issues that the next administration and the next congress will have to deal with  we
have to be really on point and to have positions very carefully thought out not just by the board
but by the entire fomc and the entire system so that we can have a unified position to make
sure that crazy stuff doesnt happen and that sensible stuff does  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  i obviously support the strategy laid out  i just want to
underscore particularly in response to governor warshs comments that this is in effect a
conditional extension in the sense that we are being careful to get ourselves more comfortable
with where these four firms in particular are on capital and liquidity before we announce an
extension  we are trying to get clarity on the ongoing supervisory relationship with the sec
before we announce an extension  we have already gotten the 18 major dealers in the world to
commit themselves to a path to improve the capacity of the otc derivatives infrastructure to
withstand failure before announcing  we have already begun to get the resources held against
default risk in the existing central counterparties higher in satisfaction of president sterns
general admonition that we want the system better able to withstand failure  i think we are just
beginning the delicate process of taking some of the air out of the vulnerable triparty repos
before the extension is announced  so in that sense we have left ourselves in this strategy that
the chairman laid out with a little less vulnerability to the possible impression that we would just
willynilly extend with no effort to make the system safer  we are not going to get far enough
we are not going to know whats far enough  but i think we have a credible plan to say we
took the initiative even in a moment of incredible delicacy for dealing with the system to try to
get these institutions and the system in a better capacity to withstand the possibility of failure
in that sense its a defensible and sensible strategy
i really dont know what the right mix of boundaries is on access to liquidity in normal
times and in extremis and what mix of supervisory authority conditions with what type of
resolution regime is optimal  i just dont have a sense  i feel as though i know the broad
tradeoffs in it but i dont know what really looks ideal in terms of the mix of those things  you
can make a pretty reasonable case for a whole bunch of variance in that mix of things  the
complication for us is that we wont be able to fully control the outcome because it is going to
require legislation  part of the consequence of the system that we live with and part of the reason
that we live with the system we have today is that policymakers and regulators dont fully
control the outcome in terms of the incentives created in the legislation for these kinds of things
so it will be difficult for us but all we can do is focus on the merits think through those ahead of
everybody else and try to have the best package of suggestions that we can
but just to come back to what we spent most of the last two days talking about lets not
lose sight of the fact that we are in the middle of this still  it likely has a long way to go  it is
very hard for us to know now what we are going to decide at the end was the most critical source
of vulnerability and therefore what to do to fix it  we dont know what the market is going to
think the new equilibrium should be in terms of the return on equity across different types of
financial institutions and models  another reason to be careful as we try to contain the risks in
this crisis and make the system stronger in the near term is so that we dont prejudge some of
those longerterm questions  thank you
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser
mr plosser  i want to come back to one of governor warshs comments just probe
it a little further because i was intrigued by his notion that in some way trying to wean ourselves
from this he suggested that we raise the price  it occurred to me in that same context if we
thought that had value in some sense another way we could do the transition is to cut back either
the frequency or the size of the tslf as we sort of wean the markets off access  announcing
both those things in advance might have some value to us moving forward  i wanted to hear
other peoples thoughts and reactions
chairman bernanke  vice chairman
vice chairman geithner  first i completely agree that once we get to the point
at which we believe the best policy is to dial this stuff back and transition to a world in which
they dont exist we are going to want to look at a whole bunch of thingschanging terms
changing the relative attractiveness across the auction facilities thinking about size and thinking
about price  i think that will be very important to do  it is very unlikely that the optimal path is
going to be that there is a cliffone day they are there and the next day they arent  so i
completely agree with that
my own judgment isbut it may not be right and it could change over timethat for the
moment we want to have a clean crisp signal  better to say that we are going to extend in the
context of these broader initiatives to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter
their terms and relative attractiveness  but we are going to have to think very carefully over the
fall conditions permitting and well ahead of whatever the new date is what the desirable exit
strategy is in changing incentives around use
however my basic sense is not now not yet partly because of the complexity of the
signal you are sending and the difficulty of how it will be interpreted  we have done all this
stuff in part because we are trying to address a complicated mix of things around incentives
stigma and that kind of thing  it is hard for us to predict what the effect would be  its purpose is
to wean but to do it now would make the message a bit more complicated  if the world is strong
enough that you can wean them now why are you extending  so my basic sense is absolutely
we are going to have to figure it out by the transition not quite yet but well ahead of february 15
or whenever it is going to be
chairman bernanke  president lacker
mr lacker  yes  i support governor warshs suggestion for raising the price  it is
hard for me to believe that confidence in any of these institutions depends materially on
100 basis points of the price  it is the access the funding that they would be able to use to fund
withdrawal or flight by somebody  i think it sends the right signal that we view this as
exceptional  conditions are certainly different than they were in march when we designed and
implemented it and i think they are unlikely in the fall to be anywhere close to where they were
on march 16  you might disagree and we could always change things between now and then
but i like the signal of withdrawing the generosity just a tad
chairman bernanke  remember that we are doing moral suasion as well  i
mean we are not really allowing investment banks to use this as a profit center  so im not quite
sure what the marginal effect would be on incentives
mr lacker  but this would also place less weight on moral suasion to discourage
and would use the price system a bit
chairman bernanke  it also might increase the stigma  it is a very complicated
calculation
vice chairman geithner  there are many things that i would love to do  i
would like to make them pay for it and say that we are not going to extend it unless they pay for
it  i would like to say that we are not going to extend it unless they prefund some liquidation
facility for one of their little counterparties  there are a million things that i think would be
good to do from an incentive anglebut not at the same time that we are trying to maximize the
chance that we get through this and have the flexibility to let monetary policy adjust to the
changing amounts of risk on the other side of the tail  so there are a million things i think it
would be cool to do and we will have to do them  we will design them really in a clever way
once we are at the point where that is optimal but i just dont think thats now  the risk is that it
will undermine what we are trying to achieve with a fleeting make us feel better benefit
chairman bernanke  governor warsh
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  so just on behalf of the troublemaker caucus
laughter let me make a suggestion  it doesnt strike me as though the deltas between vice
chairman geithners formulation and what i proffered are that large  that is i think we
collectively agree that we need as part of an extension of the facility to ensure that there is a
suite of facilities and selfhelp effortstriparty repos otc derivatives principles by you and
clarity on what the horizon looks like  i guess the only question is at the time that you solicit
the notation vote and announce thislets say that is the second half of julyhow comfortable
are we at how that package looks to suggest that we are keeping options open and that the signal
we are sending is not that this is a business that we want to stay in forever  maybe in that
context we will see what kind of progress we are making in truth on some of those infrastructure
improvements and in the narrative so that we can revisiti think maybe with some guidance
from brian bill and the staffwhat the incremental benefits are of a modest change to the
pdcf in that context  by the second half of july we might find that we are much more
informed so as to weigh the benefits and costs of it
chairman bernanke  bill dudley did you have a comment
mr dudley  the real issue may be that the pdcf borrowing may be de minimis  in
that environment its not really clear what raising the price really means  it might even be
confusing to people if you raise the price at the time the borrowing was de minimis  so i think
that is just one consideration
chairman bernanke  okay  if there are no other pressing comments thank you
very much for this discussion  i heard general support for the shortterm strategy which means
i hope that if we do come to ask you for an extension of the tslf we can do it by notation vote
without a videoconference meeting unless things change
there clearly is a lot of dissatisfaction among all of us about the ad hoc nature of the way
we had to deal with the crisis in march  we would all like much more clarity about our
authorities the limit of those authorities and the match between our responsibilities and our
authorities and as we go forward we will try to get clarification on that  at the same time we
also want to take steps to try to increase the resilience of the system and reduce the risk that we
will be in the same situation again in the future
i will try to vet my speech  i dont want to overpromise  it has to be done over the
fourth of july weekend so i expect everyone to be available 247 for commentary  laughter
but i will generally be talking about things that we are doing  i will talk only in general terms
about some of the principles that we have discussed today about the need for clarification about
how to resolve a troubled institution how to set those limits and so on  but i will try to circulate
that to the extent that it is feasible
lets see our next meeting is tuesday august 5  you are invited to get lunch and come
back to the table to hear laricke blanchards update on congressional matters  if you have any
revisions to your economic projections you have until 500 pm tomorrow to send those in  and
i want to thanki havent done thisart scott pat and all of their colleagues who have been
working very hard on these issues for their presentation and their hard work  the meeting is
adjourned
end of meeting
