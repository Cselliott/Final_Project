transcript of the federal open market committee meeting of october 3031 2007 
october 30 2007afternoon session 
 
chairman bernanke  good afternoon everybody  this meeting is karen johnsons last  she attended her first meeting in 1991 and has been a regular participant for the past ten years so she has ninetyone total fomc meetings to her credit  karen has been briefing the fomc on international financial and economic matters since she became head of the international finance division in 1997 and she has done a great job of covering about 95 percent of the worlds population and about twothirds or more of the worlds economic activity  also as the head of if she has logged an awful lot of miles to world bankimf meetings the bis and elsewhere  she has given me a lot of good advice on jetlag i can assure you  she is going to finance her retirement with frequentflyer miles  laughter  so karen i am sure every member of the committee would like to join me in thanking you for your dedication and your excellent advice and counsel  best of luck  applause 
ms johnson  thank you 
chairman bernanke  i have the less pleasant duty of reminding everybody about the wall street journal article on our communications policy that appeared some time ago  i dont think anybody actually leaked the story because the way greg ip works is that he goes around and talks to each person and gets a little of the story and then builds it up in that way  nevertheless i think it is obviously bad for our institution when our internal deliberations become public and so let me just ask everyone please to be especially careful about maintaining confidentiality  thank you 
for our first item today in light of karens retirement we would like to propose nathan sheets to be an economist for the fomc until the first meeting of 2008  do i have a motion 
several  so moved 
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  next we turn to bill dudley 
mr dudley1 footnote 1 materials used by mr dudley are appended to this transcript appendix 1 end footnote 1   thank you mr chairman  i am going to miss karen as my fellow scribe at the bis  she also was the person who identified who was actually speaking  laughter  
 
two crosscurrents have dominated financial markets since the september 18 fomc meeting  1 greater discrimination by investors with respect to credit quality across asset classes versus 2 ongoing deterioration in credit quality within the class of mortgagerelated assets  on the one hand underlying market function has generally improved  in particular investors have shown greater ability to differentiate between the corporate and the mortgage sectors and between different types of products such as collateralized loan obligations clos versus collateralized debt obligations cdos  most of the assetbacked commercial paper market is no longer under duress bank funding pressures have abated somewhat and the issuance of clos and highyield debt has increased  on the other hand those areas more closely linked to the us housing sector remain under pressure  this includes the subprime mortgage market the mortgagebacked securities market and financial entitiessuch as mortgage and financial guarantorsthat have significant exposures to these asset classes   
 
the tension between the improved ability of investors to discriminate among risky assets versus the deteriorating fundamentals is illustrated in the performance of the abx indexes  these indexes measure the cost of buying protection on different tranches of particular vintages of mortgagebacked securities that hold subprime mortgage loan assets  i will be referring to the handout in front of you  exhibit 1 shows the performance for the 0701 vintagethat is mortgagebacked securities originated mainly during the second half of 2006  as can be seen the prices of the lowerrated tranches have continued to plunge in response to rising delinquency rates for subprime loans and the virtual shutdown of the subprime mortgage market  in contrast the performance of the aaarated tranche has held up better especially until very recently  this suggests that investors are more carefully distinguishing between the implications of widespread subprime losses for those tranches such as aaa that are in a senior position in the structure versus lowerrated tranches where the losses may well be large enough to wipe out their value altogether  similarly investors appear to be doing a better job of discriminating between the different types of assetbacked commercial paper programs  those with highquality diversified collateral or strong bank support or both are performing well  in contrast those programs with less solid supportmainly siv and extendible programsin which the commercial paper holders are more vulnerable to loss continue to hit liquidity and capital triggers and are gradually being wound down  as shown in exhibit 2 the overall assetbacked commercial paper market has been contracting recently at a much slower pace than earlier in the summer  moreover secured commercial paper rates have narrowed significantly relative to the overnight index swap rate and relative to topquality unsecured commercial paper exhibit 3   
 
the ability of banks to securitize assets also appears to have improved  in particular as shown in exhibits 4 and 5 clo and highyield debt issuance has picked up  however cdo issuance remains very depressed relative to the level of issuance earlier in the year  investors have lost confidence in this product as market prices have plunged and the rating agencies have begun to cut their ratings often very sharply on many outstanding cdos  market participants are more willing to buy corporate debt for three reasons  first the underlying fundamentals in the corporate sector remain good  second the underlying assets are much easier to value  third investors are more willing to trust the credit ratings in this area  the rating agency models have been battletested over a much longer period and have been shown to be robust across a broad range of environments  in contrast the ability of banks to securitize nonconforming mortgage loans remains impaired  nevertheless spreads between jumbo and conforming mortgage loan rates have come in a bit see exhibit 6  this may reflect diminished pressure on bank balance sheets from other sources   
 
overall term funding pressures for banks have diminished as banks have gained greater clarity about their future funding needs and the need for excess liquidity has diminished  nevertheless term funding pressures still persist  as can be seen in exhibit 7 although the spreads between onemonth libor and the onemonth overnight index swap rate and threemonth libor and the threemonth overnight index swap rate have narrowed these spreads remain high relative to the level of spreads evident at the beginning of the summer  exhibit 8 shows the same spreads for europethey have also come in but remain higher than normal  although the credit default swap cds spreads for the large investment banks and the large commercial banks narrowed following the last fomc meeting much of this improvement has been reversed over the past two weeks as the housing outlook has deteriorated further and as the earnings announcements for several major financial institutions have disappointed investors  similarly the cds spreads for mortgage insurers and financial guarantors have widened  these cds spreads are shown in exhibit 9   
 
the broader bond and equity markets have generally shown improvement  in the fixed income market credit default swap spreads have fallen somewhat for the highyield debt market see exhibit 10 and the us equity market has largely recovered over the past couple of months see exhibit 11  interestingly despite the poor earnings of the financial sector and the outlook for slower us growth earnings expectations of equity analysts for 2007 have declined only slightly and the decline in 2007 has been offset by an upward revision to 2008 earnings estimates see exhibit 12  moreover the demand for downside protection in the equity market has diminished  exhibit 13 examines the relative cost of buying a put versus a call  a positive skew is consistent with a greater cost of downside protection  although a significant positive skew persists it is now much lower than it was immediately before the september 18 fomc meeting  exhibits 14 and 15 summarize the incomplete transition away from riskreduction behavior by financial market participants  exhibit 14 shows the correlation of daily price movements and yield changes across the different asset classes for the time interval between the august and the september fomc meetings  as can be seen the correlations were very highindicating that risk aversion was the dominant impulse among investorswith most of the correlations over this period exceeding an absolute value of 05  these are shaded in blue in the exhibit  in contrast the same correlations since the september 18 fomc meeting shown in exhibit 15 have come down but remain much higher than during the first half of the year     
 
two other market developments deserve a brief mention before i turn to dealer expectations concerning monetary policy and a brief look at inflation expectations  first crude oil prices have shot higher  there is considerable disagreement among market participants about how long the higher prices will last and the factors behind the price surge  although some argue that it is speculative others point to morefundamental drivers such as inventory drawdowns geopolitical uncertainties and dollar weakness  regardless of the cause the effect on the macroeconomy has been modest up to now because higher crude oil prices have not fed through meaningfully into product prices  that is because the socalled crack spreadthe margin between the value of the refined products produced from that crude oil and the cost of crude oil supplyhas come down sharply as shown in exhibit 16  the narrowness of the crack spread implies that further increases in crude oil prices if forthcoming would likely feed through into product prices  second the dollar continues on its gradual downward course  although the dollar has reached new lows against the euro and the canadian dollar the overall pace of the decline as measured by the broad tradeweighted index has not changed much from the trend exhibited earlier in the year see exhibit 17  the dollars trajectory still appears to be driven mainly by interest rate differentials  this can be seen in exhibit 18 which shows the dollar versus the euro relative to the eurodollareuribor interest rate differential  moreover there is little evidence that the dollars slide has made investors less willing to participate in the long end of the us bond market  you can see that by the fact that us 10year treasury note yields are still fairly low trading around 44 percent 
 
market expectations about monetary policy have shown considerable variability since the last fomc meeting  exhibit 19 tracks the implied probability of different target rate outcomes at this meeting calculated from the option prices on federal funds futures contracts  as can be seen in the exhibit the probability of a 25 basis point cut has fluctuated in a wide range  the most recent survey of primary dealers conducted ten days ago shows a slight tilt toward a 25 basis point cut at the current meeting with eleven dealers expecting a 25 basis point cut nine expecting no change and one expecting a 50 basis point reduction  since that time a number of dealers have shifted camp  currently a more informal survey by the desk indicates that nineteen out of twentyone dealers expect a 25 basis point rate cut at this meeting  exhibits 20 and 21 show the primary dealer forecasts for the federal funds rate before the september and the current fomc meetings  as can be seen the dealers forecasts for the federal funds rate path are currently a bit lower than before the september 18 meetingpartially reflecting the fact that the fomc easing of 50 basis points at the september meeting was of greater magnitude than the cut embodied in the average dealer forecast  also the gap between the dealers forecasts and the expectations embodied in market rates has narrowed over the past six weeks  as can be seen considerable disagreement about the rate path remains  one year out the dispersion of the modal dealer forecasts remains very wide   
 
inflation expectations increased following the 50 basis point rate cut in september  however the degree of widening is sensitive to how the forward breakeven inflation rate is calculated  exhibit 22 shows the fiveyear fiveyearforward implied inflation rate as estimated by the board staff versus the fiveyear fiveyearforward breakeven inflation rate as estimated by barclays bank a major participant in the tips market  as can be seen in the exhibit typically these two measures move together  more recently however they have diverged a bit with the board staff measure showing a more persistent increase following the september fomc meeting  the two measures differ in the securities that they use to compare nominal versus inflationadjusted yieldswith the board staff using a smoothed yield curve based on offtherun nominal treasuries and the barclays measure using the ontherun nominal fiveyear and tenyear treasury notes to compare with the fiveyear and tenyear tips notes  however liquidity differences among treasury securities are hard to model  as a result it is difficult to be confident of the accuracy of such adjustments  this argues that one should not completely dismiss the barclays measure when the two measures are behaving differently  this might especially be true when no rise in longterm inflation expectations is evident in other measures such as the university of the michigans survey of consumer sentiment or the desks own primary dealer survey   
 
finally i want to discuss briefly the desks performance in implementing the fomcs directive from the last meeting for a 475 percent federal funds rate target  in this respect let me make two observations  first in contrast to the previous intermeeting period in which the effective rate traded below the target for much of the period the average effective rate has been extremely close to the target since the september 18 meeting  exhibit 23 shows the cumulative effective rate relative to the target since the last meeting  second as shown in exhibit 24 there has still been more daytoday volatility in the federal funds rate than earlier in the year  this pattern likely reflects several factors including the demand by european banks for funds early in the day and the reduced spread between the discount rate and the target federal funds rate which has altered the banks demand for reserve balances   
 
there were no foreign operations during this period  i request a vote to ratify the operations conducted by the system open market account since the september 18 fomc meeting  of course i am very happy to take questions 
 
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  are there questions for bill  no questions  okay  then may i have a motion to ratify 
mr kohn  so moved 
chairman bernanke  without objection  thank you  a very thorough briefing  i dont know if we will have the same luck over on this side  laughter  let me turn to dave stockton to begin the economic situation report 
mr stockton  thank you mr chairman  from a forecast perspective its been a pretty wild ride over the intermeeting period with our outlook for activity shifting sharply at various points in the process in response to large swings in the stock market the exchange value of the dollar and the price of crude oil  a couple of weeks ago with the incoming data stronger the stock market up substantially and the dollar down noticeably we were looking at a forecast that had economic growth moving materially above potential later in the projection period  it appeared that after taking you for a tour of the sausage factory in my september briefing i would need to issue a recall of that last batch of sausages even before the arrival of their typically short expiration date  in the event the stock market retraced most of its earlier increase and some of the improvement in financial conditions that had occurred immediately following the september meeting was subsequently reversed  as a consequence our forecast changed relatively little on net over the past six weeks  the growth of real activity is higher in the near term but in 2008 and 2009 the stimulative effects on gdp growth of the lower dollar are offset by the restraint on incomes and spending imposed by the higher path for oil prices  we expect the growth of real gdp to slow from a 2 percent pace this year to a 1 percent pace in 2008 before edging back up to a 2 percent rate in 2009  the period of belowtrend growth late this year and next year results in some easing of pressures on resource utilization and core inflation moves roughly sideways at just under 2 percent over the forecast period 
 
 to my mind recent developments raise three big questions about our forecast  first does the broadbased strength that we have seen in the data on spending and activity over the intermeeting period suggest that we have overestimated the restraining effects on aggregate demand emanating from the recent financial turbulence  second is the staff missing signs of greater restraint on aggregate demand that will weigh more heavily on activity in the period ahead  finally with oil prices up sharply the dollar having depreciated and resource utilization a touch tighter why is our forecast for core inflation about unchanged 
 
 let me start with the question about whether the strength in the incoming data casts doubt on our estimates of the restraining effects of financial turbulence  there can be little denying that almost across the board the readings on economic activity have been stronger than our expectations in september  in terms of domestic spending the largest upside surprises have been in consumer spending and much of the upward revision reflects data on activity after the financial turbulence had already begun  overall consumer spending was stronger than we had expected in august and the available information on retail sales and on sales of motor vehicles suggests that real pce exceeded our expectations for september as well  at this point we know very little about october  chain store sales have softened somewhat but only by enough to make us comfortable with the meager monthly gains in spending that we are projecting for the fourth quarter  our discussions with the automakers suggest that sales this month have remained reasonably steady  all told thirdquarter growth in consumption looks stronger than we had expected and spending appears to be headed into the fourth quarter with a bit more momentum   
 
in the business sector stronger purchases of motor vehicles led us to raise our forecast of equipment spending in the third quarter  the other components of es came in close to our expectations though last weeks data on orders and shipments of capital goods which we received after the greenbook was completed were also a bit stronger than we had anticipated  the incoming data on construction put in place are consistent with our projected sharp slowdown in the growth of nonresidential structures after a surge in the second quarter  but even here the data have outflanked us to the upside with surprising strength in commercial construction factory buildings and telecommunications structures  taken together stronger consumption and investment account for only about half of the upward revision that we made to real gdp growth in the third and fourth quarters  the external sector accounts for the other half  in particular continuing a pattern we have seen during much of this year the growth of exports once again exceeded our expectations  we estimate that real exports increased at an annual rate of nearly 17 percent in the third quarter about 3 percentage points above our september forecast and we have marked up export growth in the current quarter as well  the greater strength in both foreign and domestic demand led us to revise up the growth of real gdp in the second half of this year about  percentage point with annualized growth rates of 3 percent and 1 percent in the third and fourth quarters respectively 
 
 so do these fairly broadbased upward surprises in spending and activity suggest that we overreacted in the extent to which we marked down our projection in response to the recent difficulties in financial markets  it certainly seems a legitimate possibility  however we think it would be premature to make that call  as bill noted financial market conditions have improved somewhat over the intermeeting period but remain far from normal  in terms of credit provision the senior loan officer opinion survey revealed a sharp jump in the fraction of banks reporting tighter terms and standards on loans to businesses and households a development consistent with the restraint on spending that we have built into our forecast  consumer sentiment remains depressed relative to overall economic conditions perhaps because of worries about financial developments  for now although we have slightly trimmed the magnitude of the turmoil effects on aggregate demand the more important adjustment in this forecast has been to push more of the restraint into next year  
 
 at the other end of the spectrum of worry is the second question that i posed earlier  have we missed some significant signs of potential economic weakness in the developments of the intermeeting period  financial market participants seem to have reacted to the news of the past six weeks by marking down the expected path for the fed funds rate whereas our forecast and policy assumptions are nearly unchanged  is it possible that we are missing signs of an impending downturn in aggregate activity  of course the prudent and accurate answer to that question is always yes  but if that turns out to be the case it wont be for lack of attention  at present it is difficult to find evidence in highfrequency indicators that the economy is in the process of turning down  initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained relatively low motor vehicle sales are reported to have been well maintained at least through midoctober commodity prices are firm reports from purchasing managers continue to suggest modest expansion and few anecdotes outside the housing sector sound as though weve moved past a tipping point   
 
if we are missing something important it seems more likely to me that we could be facing a moregrinding period of subpar economic performance associated with a deeper and moreprotracted adjustment in the housing sector  it might seem a bit surprising to point to housing as a major downside risk when this has been one aspect of our forecast that was right on the mark over the intermeeting period we had expected steep declines in sales and starts and that is what we got  but i would counsel you not to take too much comfort from that observation  in our forecast we expect sales and starts of new singlefamily homes to decline another 8 percent before bottoming out around the turn of the year  the projected configuration of starts and sales is consistent with a dropback in the months supply of unsold new homes from an estimated peak of 8 months early next year to 4 months by the end of 2009  residential investment continues to fall through the middle of next year and only edges up thereafter  but it is not difficult to envision a more painful period of adjustment  we know a huge inventory imbalance still exists in the housing sector  if in response to that imbalance house prices register steeper declines than the ones we are forecasting prospective purchasers could experience an even greater fear of buying into a declining market reinforcing the housing sectors drag on aggregate activity  moreover sharply lower prices could have moreserious implications for the ability of households to refinance existing mortgages and could impair the performance of mortgage markets more broadly  those strains as they have in recent months could spill over into other areas of the financial markets  as we showed in a couple of alternative simulations in the greenbook a steeper decline in house prices and construction activity could result in a path for the fed funds rate that does not differ materially from the one that appears to be currently built into market expectations  we remain comfortable with our baseline projection for housing but it is still easier to see sizable downside risks than sizable upside risks to this aspect of our forecast and that suggests to me that our modal forecast of gdp still has more weight to the downside than the upside  that said given the strength over the intermeeting period of the incoming data outside housing that downward skew is probably less pronounced in this forecast than in the one we presented in september 
 
turning to the price projection the question i posed at the outset was why our forecast of core price inflation is largely unchanged given higher oil prices a lower dollar and tighter resource utilization  with respect to resource utilization both the gdp gap and the unemployment rate suggest only slightly tighter product and labor markets than in our previous forecast and given the flatness of our aggregate supply curve the effect on prices over this period is negligible  as for the lower dollar we see higher import price inflation in the near term in line with the recent depreciation but these effects quickly play through  more broadly the available evidence continues to suggest that exchange rate passthrough to import prices is quite low which in turn mutes the effects on broader prices  the indirect consequences of higher oil prices are a bit more consequential and all else being equal would have added about a tenth to our core price projection in 2008  but not all else was equal  the incoming data on core pce prices were again slightly more favorable than we had expected  the surprise in this intermeeting period was largely in nonmarket prices  more broadly the deceleration that we have observed in core pce prices over the past year has been greater than can be explained by our models and we have carried a bit larger negative residual forward in this forecast  as a consequence we expect core pce price inflation to move sideways at a 19 percent pace in 2008 and 2009 unchanged from our previous forecast  overall price inflation is projected to move down from 3 percent this year to 18 percent in 2008 and 17 percent in 2009  the deceleration in overall prices reflects some decline on net in energy prices over the next two years and a dropback in food price inflation to a rate closer to that of core consumer prices  on the whole id characterize the risks around our inflation forecast as roughly balanced  nathan will continue our presentation 
 
mr sheets  although the foreign economies appear to have grown at a moderate pace during the third quarter as a whole indicators for september and october suggest that the recent financial turmoil may yet leave an imprint on activity in some countries  perhaps the most striking evidence on this score has been the ecbs survey of euroarea bank lending  in the third quarter this survey showed the sharpest shift toward tightening in its fiveyear history along with evidence of morestringent credit standards for business and housing loans  in addition we have seen downward moves in surveys and measures of sentiment in the euro area particularly in germany although these indicators have generally remained in expansionary territory  in the united kingdom the growth of mortgage lending continued on a downward path in september and a recent bank of england survey suggests a tightening of corporate credit conditions  all in all we see this admittedly fragmentary evidence as broadly consistent with our assumption in the september greenbook that fallout from the financial turmoil is likely to exert some drag on growth over the next several quarters in the euro area the united kingdom and canada  this assessment however is marked by significant upside and downside risksas it is still too soon to gauge these effects with much confidence  as in our previous forecast we do not see the turmoil weighing directly on activity in japan or the emergingmarket economies 
 
more generally the contours of our forecast remain similar to those in september  recent data have confirmed our expectation that average economic growth abroad declined to about 3 percent in the third quarter cooling from the very rapid rate in the first half of the year  we see growth edging down further in the current quarter to just over 3 percent and remaining at about that pace in 2008 and 2009  after the greenbook went to bed we received chinese gdp data which according to our seasonally adjusted quarterly estimate grew at an annual rate of just over 8 percent in the third quartera little slower than we had expected and down from the 14 percent rate in the first half of the year  this deceleration appears to have been led by a slowing in investment and a smaller contribution from the external sector  going forward economic growth in china should remain below its previous doubledigit pace as the chinese authorities take further action to cool the countrys booming real estate market and the rapid growth of bank lending    
 
in addition to uncertainty about the eventual effects of the financial turmoil on real activity other risks to our generally favorable foreign outlook are worth noting  first on this list is the possibility of a softerthanexpected performance from the us economy  although there is talk in some quarters about socalled decouplingthat is that the foreign economies may now be less linked to developments in the united states than has been the case in the pastthe jury is still out on this point  although domestic demand does appear to have firmed in some foreign countries in recent years a marked slowing in us growth would affect the rest of the world through trade channels particularly canada mexico and emerging asia and as highlighted by the recent turmoil probably through financial channels as well  as a second risk houseprice valuations in many advanced economies appear elevated  given that a correction in housing markets abroadwith potentially sizable accompanying wealth effectsstrikes us as an important downside risk for some countries  third although we see average foreign inflation remaining well behaved at near 2 percent over the next two years inflation risks cannot be dismissed  after several years of exceptionally strong economic growth the foreign economies on average are now operating near potential and resource constraints may be more binding than we currently envision  in addition food prices have moved up in many countries and the prices of oil and other commodities are at high levels  
 
indeed recent developments in oil markets seem to pose intensified risks  the spot price of wti is trading today at nearly 92 a barrel up 5 since the greenbook went to bed  since your last meeting the spot wti price has climbed 13 per barrel while the farfutures price has increased about 10 per barrel  it suffices to say that underlying supplydemand conditions in the oil market are exceptionally tight  over the past several years as the global economy has expanded briskly oil production has increased only sluggishlyreflecting both opec supply restraint and diminishing production from oecd countries  against this backdrop the price of oil has been driven up further in recent weeks by reports of decreasing inventories at a time of year when such stocks are typically on the rise and by intensified concerns about the stability of middle east oil production triggered by tensions between turkey and iraq and by concerns about us relations with iran  we see opecs plans to expand production 500000 barrels per day beginning on november 1 even if fully implemented as unlikely to go very far in defusing the tightness in the market  futures markets call for wti prices to remain elevated in the neighborhood of 80 per barrel through 2015   
 
 i conclude with some upbeat news on us external performance  exports continue to surprise on the upside having shown exceptional strength in the july and august trade data as exports of aircraft autos and agricultural products have all expanded briskly  consequently as dave mentioned real exports of goods and services are now thought to have surged at a pace of 17 percent in the third quarter up 3 percentage points from the last forecast  we estimate that real imports in the third quarter grew at a comparatively modest rate  taken together these data suggest that net exports made an arithmetic contribution of 1 percentage points to us real gdp growth in the third quarter 
 
going forward we see export growth moderating to just under 8 percent in the current quarter and proceeding at a solid 6 percent average rate through the next two years  relative to our september forecast the path of export growth is up nearly 2 percentage points in the fourth quarter and by lesserbut still sizableamounts in 2008 and 2009  this higher projection reflects stimulus from recent declines in the dollar which have exceeded our previous projections  the broad dollar index has dropped more than 3 percent since your last meeting  but in addition to support from the weaker dollar we now see greater underlying strength in exports than we had previously thought  our projected path for imports in contrast is little changed from the last greenbook  import growth is slated to bounce up in the current quarter largely because of a seasonal rebound in oil imports  thereafter the projected strengthening of us growth and a deceleration in core import prices should provide increasing support to imports  all told we see the external sector making a neutral contribution to us real gdp growth in the fourth quarter contributing 04 percentage point to economic growth next year and returning to neutrality in 2009 as imports accelerate  thus to the extent that our forecast materializes large negative contributions from net exports might very well be a thing of the past  brian will now continue our presentation 
 
mr madigan2 footnote 2 materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 2 end footnote 2   i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on october projections  the table shows the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2007 and the next three years  where available the central tendencies and ranges of the projections last published by the committeethose submitted for inclusion in the july monetary policy reportare shown in italics   
 
notably a majority of you conditioned your current projections on an easing of monetary policy with most of that majority apparently seeing lower rates as appropriate either imminently or within the next six months or so  even with that assumed easing your gdp growth forecasts for 2007 have been marked down slightly since last june and your outlook for next year has been revised down more substantially  many of you noted that last summers nipa revisions led you to lower your estimate of potential gdp growth  most of you cited the intensification of the downturn in housing markets the turmoil in financial markets and higher oil prices as factors leading you to scale back your expectations for actual growth in 2007 and 2008 though some participants commented that rising net exports could provide support to aggregate demand  the central tendency of the economic growth forecasts for 2008 is now 18 percent to 25 percent below the central tendency of 2 percent to 2 percent in june  perhaps partly because you expect easing whereas the staff assumed an unchanged stance of policy the central tendency of your economic growth projections is above the greenbook forecast of 17 percent for real economic growth in 2008  that difference may also reflect your somewhat more optimistic view of potential growth  it is worth noting that the divergence among your views concerning the outlook for next year has widened substantially  the width of the central tendency for example at nearly  percentage point is about three times that in the june projections   
 
the downward revision to the outlook for gdp growth was mirrored in a small upward revision to the unemployment rate  the central tendency of the projections for unemployment at the end of this year is around 4 percent and it centers on a rate just under 5 percent at the end of next year  based on the comments that some of you have made about sustainable rates of unemployment and on your longerrun unemployment projections many of you apparently predict the emergence of a small amount of slack by the end of next year 
   
with incoming data on core inflation a bit better than you had expected and with some slack likely next year the central tendency of your projections for core pce inflation is down noticeably for 2007 and is a shade lower for 2008 most of you now see core inflation below 2 percent in both years  your nearterm forecasts for total pce inflation are higher than those for core inflation reflecting surging energy prices and in some cases an expectation of continued brisk increases in food prices 
    
with regard to the uncertainties in the outlook most of you see the risks to growth as tilted to the downsideeven with an assumed easing of policyand judge that the degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for economic activity is unusually high relative to average levels over the past twenty years  your commentaries highlighted downside risks arising from the possibility that financial market turmoil and tighter credit conditions could exert unexpectedly large restraint on household and business spending and that the downturn in housing could prove even steeper than currently anticipated  a slight majority perceived the risks to total inflation as broadly balanced and a more sizable majority judged that the risks to core inflation are in balance in both cases those in the minority saw the risk to inflation as tilted to the upside  as the experience in the september trial run highlighted the committees policy statement will need to be reviewed carefully for potential inconsistencies with the risk assessments submitted with the projections  i will return to that issue tomorrow   
  
turning to the longerhorizon forecasts you expect real gdp growth of around 2 percent and unemployment slightly above 4 percent in both 2009 and 2010  judging from your forecast narratives these projections are close to your estimates of the economys potential growth rate and the level of the nairu  the former is a bit higher than the staff estimate of about 21 percent potential growth and the latter is close to the staff estimate  for 2009 and 2010 all of your core inflation forecasts are in a range of 1 to 2 percent  a couple of you expect rising prices of food and energy to keep total inflation above 2 percent in 2009 but all of your forecasts for total inflation are within a range of 1 to 2 percent in 2010  many of you state that you view your projections for inflation in 2010 as consistent with price stability 
 
chairman bernanke  thank you  are there questions for our colleagues  vice chairman geithner 
vice chairman geithner  dave this is about the greenbook forecasti was going to say existentialism but i am not sure that is quite right  laughter  dave is the greenbook forecast something we should view as a modal forecast as i think you implied or the expected value of the range of plausible scenarios that might have 
mr stockton  well i would say this is a modal forecast and as i indicated i think there is probably more downside mass than upside mass in that probability distribution at this point 
vice chairman geithner  is the monetary policy path that you reveal in the greenbook based on the modal forecast 
mr stockton  thinking about our forecast as a modal forecast is correct 
vice chairman geithner  thank you  if i could ask one more question  in the greenbook you reveal the usual assumptions for what you anticipate for total credit growth and you show it decelerating significantly over this period  how does the deceleration you are anticipating look compared with a range of previous periods in which the us economy was slowing significantly or periods following substantial financial distress  for example if you compare it with 200102 or 199091 is it a modest deceleration in credit growth or does it look large compared with that  
mr stockton  well i should get the facts before i answer your question in terms of exactly how this compares with both the 2000 period and the 1990 period  we could certainly do that and circulate it to the committee  obviously in our forecast we have credit growth decelerating not just because overall activity is decelerating but because we think there will be some important restraints on credit availability going forward  most of that of course is on the mortgage side but some of it is on the business credit side as well  that said we are not forecasting a deep credit crunch  if you were more concerned that that was what you were facing i dont think this forecast is consistent with it  this forecast is consistent with some unusual restraint on the availability of credit principally on the mortgage side but more broadly elsewhere but not truly a deep or strong headwind type of episode in which there is substantial impairment going forward  as i noted at the last meeting even the restraint that we do have on the credit side fades over the coming year  
chairman bernanke  president plosser 
mr plosser  thank you  i have two brief questions  one in business investment particularly equipment and software you have somewhat of a rebound in the early half of 08 and then it falls off again in the latter half of 08  i didnt quite understand  given the way you have the recovery in housing coming in the middle of 08 and presumably some of the credittightening cycle gradually diminishing why is business investment falling off again in the latter half of 08  the second question just to get them both out on the table is that you are predicting that a 25 basis point unexpected boost to the fed funds rate would result in a fall in equities of about 2 percent  now the papers i have read randomly about that suggest that such an estimate is probably a bit on the high side  i just wonder where that number came from 
mr stockton  we took that estimate from a paper by ben bernanke and ken kuttner  laughter    
mr plosser  i thought that was 53 percent for 100 basis points right which would be a decline of a little over 1 percent not 2   
chairman bernanke  of course we have multiple estimates  laughter 
mr plosser  sorry  i just read the wrong one 
mr stockton  we felt that in the past we did not typically worry about that sort of surprise effect given that overall our ability to predict asset prices is so limited to begin with  this seemed stark enough that we thought we should probably lean in that direction  whether we are too large or too small i dont know  its not a very significant or consequential effect  obviously we are not pretending to forecast all the things that might happen if you were not to ease at this meeting in terms of how the financial markets might take that  were just trying to take the biggest pieces and thats where we were 
mr plosser  and the investment piece 
mr stockton  it looks to me as though some of the investment piece has to do with the idiosyncrasies of our forecast of the hightech area  the underlying core piece of es spending follows pretty much a standard accelerator path where things slow down more evenly through next year and then begin to pick up with the overall pickup in activity toward the end of next year as we move into 2009  so i think your basic intuition about what you should have seen is there  we have some slowdown in hightech spending that sort of progresses  in transportation in particular things are especially weak in the first half of this year  they pick up a little in the beginning of next year and then slow down again and that really is more based upon our forecast of motor vehicles and our forecast for aircraft production 
mr plosser  thank you 
chairman bernanke  president poole 
mr poole  i have two questions  i guess the first is more a comment than a question  when we look at the net exportsand i think you commented on that in terms of the outlookit seems to me that most of it is really coming on the import side which i assume is importantly related to domestic demand and consumption  looking at the annual dataim looking at page 24 in part 1 of the greenbook which has the annual data over a string of yearsexport growth is actually slowing in terms of percentage growth year over year  so i guess the way that i would put it is to what extent is the lower growth in imports really driven by lower aggregate consumption rather than a genuine improvement in the current account  thats one question 
another question is really quite separate and i think it will tie into our later goround here  i dont have a good sense of the relative importance of your anecdotal information in modifying your outlook compared with the underlying data that you follow so thoroughly and so expertly  to what extent do you modify the views based on the data the model and your reading of the numbers by your anecdotal information your business contacts 
mr stockton  so do you want me to start with that 
mr sheets  sure  that sounds good  laughter 
mr stockton  on the anecdotal side as i think about the revisions that weve made to the forecast of this most recent period by which we have taken down the level of gdp nearly  percentage point for our estimate of the effects of the financial disturbance i dont know whether youd call that based on anecdotal or on actual data  it felt pretty much like guesswork with a few anecdotes at the time of the last meeting when we had some measures of financial stress that were significant and we knew on the data side in terms of the impairment to the mortgage markets that something very significant was going on  the housing side was about half the adjustment that we made  so i guess id just say that a big chunk of that was probably data based but some guesswork was involved in how much restraint on housing activity would come from the cutbacks in mortgage availability that were going to occur in the subprime market  
in terms of the consumer side last time we really had very little to go on except a hint that maybe consumer sentiment had weakened somewhat  since then i think we have accumulated a little more evidence in favor of our hypothesis that possibly some restraint on spending will occur going forward  consumer sentiment has remained low relative to what we think the other macro fundamentals would suggest  we think that there is a correlation between the residuals of explaining consumer sentiment and our consumption equation  so that correlation in addition to the senior loan officer surveyagain i dont know whether you consider that anecdotal evidence or systematic data but theres a very substantial and widespread uptick in the tightening of terms and standards for both business and household loansgives us more confidence that what we thought were pretty sizable effects that we built into the forecast have some credible basis 
now there are still some touchyfeely kinds of things that were looking at  for example with the assistance of the reserve banks we did the survey of our beige book contacts on capital spending  i cant say that we didnt make some adjustment to our es forecast on the basis of those anecdotes but again those anecdotes gave us a little more confidence that something may be happening on the capital spending side going forward  so i wish i could tell you that yes threetenths of this is anecdotes and seventenths is data  theres a big gray area between the kinds of information that we gather versus the gdp data  if you ask how the gdp data alone influenced our outlook as i noted in my briefing those have been pretty clearly to the upside and we havent yet seen any hard evidence in the actual spending data outside the housing sector that were getting any restraint  so that remains a forecast based upon these other shreds of evidence that we think support some notion that there will be a weakening going forward 
mr sheets  in response to your first question i think the answer is that its the improvement in the net export contribution in the current account thats being driven by both a strengthening of exports and a softening of imports  the net export contribution or the direct contribution of exports to gdp growth has risen roughly 25 basis points over the past couple of yearsso about  percentage point  by the same token the arithmetic negative drag from imports has been reduced about 40 basis points  i think its strictly an arithmetic computational thing  your observation that its more imports than exports is absolutely right comparing 2007 with where we were several years ago  but certainly for the third quarter and for the second half exports have been extraordinarily strong and imports have been softer than maybe they were a couple of years ago but not extraordinarily weak  so in the near term its more an export story  then the other point is that certainly youre also correct that the softening of imports that weve seen over the past few years has been driven in large measure by the softening of us domestic demand and thats probablyi dont have an exact decomposition hereon the order of twothirds of the softening in imports 
chairman bernanke  other questions  if not were ready for our economic goround  president hoenig  
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  i will talk a little about the district this time  it continues to perform well with ongoing weakness in the housing sector offset by strength in agriculture and energy  as has been true for a while construction activity remains mixed with weakness in residential construction offset by continued strength in commercial construction  in terms of residential construction both the number of singlefamily permits and the value of residential construction contracts declined in september and home inventories rose with slower home sales as is happening elsewhere  however district home prices measured by the ofheo index edged up in the second quarter and remain stronger than in the nation as a whole  on the commercial side after a robust spring construction activity has slowed but has remained solid  energy regions such as wyoming report strong activity  but even in the nonenergy regions activity remains solid  office vacancy rates were stable and absorption rates declined  in addition developers reported morestringent credit standards and they expected credit availability to remain tight 
consumer spending softened in september  mall traffic was flat and retailers reported that sales were down slightly  in addition auto dealers reported that sales fell further in september as high gasoline prices cut demand for our suv sales and for vans  in other areas though activity appears to remain at least moderate  for example travel and tourism remain healthy  in addition manufacturing activity picked up slightly in october  solid increases among producers of durable goods offset a weakening among producers of food chemical and other nondurable goods  even so purchasing managers remain optimistic about future activity as most forwardlooking indexes strengthened or held steady  finally we continue to see strength in agriculture and energy  district producers are selling a bumper crop at high prices as poor crop conditions in the rest of the world trimmed global inventories and boosted export demand  in addition robust meat demand kept cattle and hog prices above breakeven levels  the sharp rise in farm income led to a surge in farm capital spending in the third quarter and is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter 
turning to the national economy my outlook for growth is basically unchanged from our last meeting  generally speaking economic indicators have been a bit stronger over the intermeeting period as described here but financial markets continue obviously to exhibit some stress  the senior loan officer survey suggested moderate tightening of credit conditions  that is consistent with our estimates of slower growth in the current quarter  as before though i remain more optimistic than the greenbook about both the nearterm outlook and the longerrun growth potential for the economy  specifically i think growth over the forecast period will average about 2 percent  my forecast is based on maintaining the fed funds rate at its current level of 4 percent through the middle of next year before reducing it to its more neutral level late next year or early 2009  with regard to trend growth i continue to expect a decline in potential growth from about 2 percent to 2 percent by 2010 
disappointing housing data have led me to mark down my nearterm forecast for residential investment  i continue to expect that residential investment will decline through the first part of next year before turning up in the second half  also after strong growth in the first half of this year nonresidential construction is likely perhaps to slow significantly over the next year and a half  supporting growth in the near term will be moderate growth in consumer and government spending along with strength in exports driven by the lower dollar and robust foreign growth 
turning to the risks to the outlook i believe they remain on the downside as far as real output but have not worsened noticeably since our last meeting especially with that action  i believe that construction both residential and nonresidential and slower consumer spending from higher energy prices constitute the main risks to the outlook  with regard to the inflation outlook recent data on core inflation continue to be as noted here favorable  i expect core pce inflation to average about 18 percent over the forecast periodremember assuming no change in the fed funds ratebut i also expect that overall pce inflation next year will moderate as the effects of higher food and energy prices wear off  however i do remain concerned about the upside risk to inflation as well  greater dollar depreciation and higher energy and commodity prices along with greater passthrough from all three could push inflation higher for a period of time  in addition i am also concerned about the implications of the gradual upcreep in the tips measures of expected inflation for the longrun path and i am receiving more anecdotal information in discussions with individuals in our region about a change in expectations about inflation as they continue to deal with some rising prices in materials and other goods  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  there has been little change in the district economic conditions since our september meeting  except for housing activity is expanding at a modest pace somewhat below trend  our business contacts are cautious generally expecting slow growth to continue over the next quarter but they remain fairly optimistic for business conditions six to twelve months out  payroll employment continues to expand at a slow pace in our three states which partially reflects slow population growth and so the unemployment rate remains slightly below that of the nation  retail sales have generally held up but there are divergent views among retailers regarding holiday sales  highend stores expect a very strong finish to the year lowerend merchants are more cautious  housing construction and sales continue to decline but the pace of that decline is in line with the expectations at our last meeting  the value of nonresidential building contracts has declined more sharply in our region than in the nation as a whole  nevertheless i would characterize nonresidential real estate markets as firm  that office vacancy rates are declining and commercial rents are rising suggests a positive outlook for commercial construction going forward 
according to our business outlook survey manufacturing activity in the district has been increasing at a modest pace for the past several months  the general index of economic activity moved down slightly from 109 in september to 69  shipments and new orders also weakened slightly  staff analysis suggests that our manufacturing index which precedes the release of national industrial production numbers provides useful information in forecasting monthly manufacturing ip and total ip  that forecasting model is predicting a rise in both manufacturing ip and total ip in october  about twothirds of the district manufacturers and servicesector firms we have polled said that recent changes in financial conditions have not prompted any change in their capital spending plans and the other firms are about evenly split as expecting a slight decrease or a slight increase over the next six to twelve months compared with the past six to twelve months  however in speaking with my business contacts i do hear a sense of continuing caution among businesses in their capital spending plans  the manufacturers seem to be a bit stronger than the service firms perhaps reflecting a more robust export market which many of them are participating in  district bankers in general continue to express concern over housing and mortgage lending but see commercial and industrial lending as fairly stable and proceeding about as they had expected 
there has been little change in the districts inflation picture since our last meeting  firms continue to report higher benefit costs but other wage pressures have moderated  our manufacturers reported having to pay higher prices for many inputs particularly energyrelated inputs and petroleumbased products as well as agricultural commodities  they have passed on many of those increases in terms of higher prices to their consumers  while retailers report only modest price increases for many products food prices are generally higher 
in summary since our last meeting there has been little change in the economic conditions in the district or in the outlook for the region  overall business activity in the region is advancing at a fairly modest pace and most of our contacts expect that pace to continue for the next quarter or so  but in general firms in the district remain optimistic about business six to twelve months from now 
turning to the nation the economy appears less vulnerable to me than it did at the time of our last meeting  financial markets have improved somewhat as bill dudley was telling us  conditions are not back to normal yet in all segments of the market but the markets that are still under stress are the same ones that were under stress last month  subprime and jumbo mortgages and assetbacked commercial paper are the ones that still are struggling  price discovery still plagues many of these markets and i suspect it will take some time before the markets can sort things out and trading returns to normal  that does not mean that the ultimate agreedupon market prices for some of these assets will bear any resemblance to what they looked like before august  indeed they probably wont but thats not necessarily a bad sign or a cause for concern it may even be a healthy development  we havent seen disruption spread to other asset classes for the most part and the level of stress in financial markets seems to have fallen even as volatility remains high  the spread of jumbo over conventional mortgage rates remains elevated reflecting some concern i think about the risk that expensive homes may face greater price declines than other homes but the premium is less than it was in september 
both investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade corporate bond issues have increased  financial institutions have begun to write off some of their investments and take the losses  this has weighed heavily on equity markets but i view the writedowns as a necessary part of the process toward stabilization in the markets  earnings reports from nonfinancial firms have actually been pretty favorable  im not saying that we are out of the woods yet but in my view the risks for a serious meltdown in financial markets have lessened somewhat since our last meeting 
the news on general economic activity has improved somewhat since our last meeting as well  indeed some of the data have come in better than expected  employment was revised up and retail sales data suggest that consumer spending remains resilient despite the downturn in housing  like the greenbook my outlook for the economy has changed little since our last meeting when we acted preemptively and lowered rates to forestall some of the potential adverse effects of financial market disruptions and the expected intensification of the housing correction on the broader economy  housing investment and sales continue to decline but about as expected in our forecast  after all the rapid reduction in subprime lending is exacerbating the decline in housing demand and thus home sales contributing to the slower recovery of that sector  other sectors of the economy have performed about as i expected with little evidence as yet of any major spillovers from housing  oil prices have moved higher than expected since our last meeting as has been discussed but it is unclear to me yet how permanent that increase will be or how much of a drag it might be on activity  the oil price rise is likely to show through to headline inflation in the coming months  although core inflation measures have improved since the beginning of the year the rise in energy prices has the potential to put upward pressure on core inflation  thus while inflation and inflationary expectations have been stable to date i suspect that inflation risks are now more to the upside than they were in september 
the forecast is an important context for our policy in my view  we have stressed in the past year that we are data driven and respond to the evolution of our forecast  in general like the greenbook as i said my forecast of the economy going forward is little changed from my september view  i see that growth returns to trend which i estimate to be about 27a little higher than the greenbooklate in 2008 as the housing correction runs its course and the financial market turbulence unwinds  core pce inflation remains slightly below 2 percent next year and moderates toward my goal of 1 percent by 2010  i built in a 25 basis point easing sometime in early 2008 to bring the funds rate back down to a more neutral level and in my baseline forecast i assume a constant funds rate thereafter  that forecast however is contingent on inflation and inflationary expectations remaining well behaved  having said that i repeat my caution that inflationary pressures are somewhat elevated at this point and we run the risk that inflationary expectations may become unhinged if the markets suspect that we have lessened our commitment to keep inflation contained  thus i dont rule out the possibility that we may have to reverse course and tighten policy sometime in 2008 or 2009 in order to achieve consistency between my target rate of inflation of 1 and inflationary expectations  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  the boston forecast is very close to that of the greenbook  with the constant federal funds rate assumption the economy is very close to full employment and core inflation is close to 2 percent at the end of 2008  such an outcome is consistent with what i would hope to achieve with appropriate monetary policy  however while this is an expected path that seems quite reasonable the distribution of risks around that outcome for growth remains skewed to the downside  our forecast like that of the greenbook expects particularly weak residential investment  problems in financing mortgages expectations of falling housing prices and moresevere financial stress for homebuilders are likely to weigh heavily over the next two quarters  in fact our forecast for residential investment has become sufficiently bleak that there may actually be some upside risk to it  laughter 
somewhat surprising to me has been the lack of spillover to the rest of the economy from the problems in residential investment  i remain concerned that falling housing prices will further sap consumer confidence and cause a pullback in consumption though to date there is little evidence of a significant effect of the housing problems on consumer spending  similarly i would have expected the financing problems that have aggravated the housing situation to have caused a sharper reduction in investment in general and in nonresidential structures in particular  however so far these remain risks rather than outcomes  thus while i am worried about the downside risks i am reminded that forecasters have frequently overestimated the consequences of liquidity problems in the past 
on the financial side there have definitely been improvements in market conditions though markets remain fragile  particularly worrisome has been the announcement of significant downgrades of tranches of cdos and mortgagebacked securities with large exposure to the subprime mortgage market  not only have the lower tranches experienced significant downgrades but a number of the aaa and aa tranches have been downgraded to below investment grade  some investors cannot retain belowinvestmentgrade securities and are forced to sell these securities in an already depressed market  the number of the downgrades the magnitude of the downgrades and the piecemeal ratings announcements all are likely to call into further question the reliability of the ratings process  if many highgrade securities tied to mortgages are downgraded to below investment grade some investors may conclude that repricing of even highgraded tranches does not reflect a liquidity problem but rather a substantial reevaluation of credit risk  thus i am concerned that continued widespread downgrades may make recovery in the securitization market more difficult particularly for nonconforming mortgages with a consequent increase in the financing cost of these assets  i also remain concerned that the assetbacked commercial paper market remains fragile  while investors seem to be distinguishing between conduits whose structure or underlying assets are quite risky my sense is that money managers are watching the market quite closely  i continue to hear concerns over the possibility that some money market funds will experience losses that will not be supported by their parents resulting in increased investor concern with the safety of money market funds more generally   
on balance the data both on the real economy and on financial markets have improved since our september meeting  that improvement makes it more likely that the economy will continue to recover gradually from the financial turmoil  however both the real and the financial risks remain skewed to the downside  
chairman bernanke  thank you  president fisher 
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  like the global economy the eleventh district is slowing but relative to the other districts it remains very strong  our retail sales improved in september  nonresidential and commercial construction remains elevated  servicesector job growth strengthened significantly in september and our staff estimates that 182 percent of the jobs created in the country year to date were created in the state of texas  i just wanted to mention that  laughter  needless to say wages are rising because of labor shortages a decline in immigration and the increase in minimum wage  i will stop with the texas brag and now go on to the national economy 
i think president rosengren just gave an excellent summary of the financial markets  i would add only the followingthat with regard to credit markets the hardening of the arteries or the blockage of the aorta or whatever cardiovascular analogy we want to choose to describe what happened is no longer as severe and lifethreatening as it appeared to be in august  as mentioned by the staff whether it is net bond issuance of investmentgrade securities or ci loans et cetera the markets are moving toward pricing assets according to what they will sell for rather than what their hypothetical mathematical modeling value might posit  there was a startling statement in the financial times on friday morning  somebody otherwise forgettable said corporate treasurers are no longer buying things they dont understand  laughter  imagine that  investors are coming home from lala land  to be sure were not out of the woods quite yet as president plosser and president rosengren mentioned  the situation remains real but weve gone beyond suspended reality  if you will forgive me you might say we have gone from the ridiculous to the subprime   
mr lacker  let the transcript say groan  laughter  
mr fisher  by that i mean by the way that the subprime market is a focus of angst which it should be but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset classes if not over is in remission  we have a long way to go before full recovery and must acknowledge that shocks regarding access might occur  i am confident as i have said in previous meetings thatjust to be politesome cow patties might show up in the punchbowls of some portfolios perhaps especially in europe and asia  but i would submit mr chairman that we are on our way back to markets priced by reason rather than by fantasy  so while we must remain ready to act as needed i think it is appropriate to focus our discussion today and tomorrow foursquare on the economy and i want to turn to that now 
the wealth effect of the severe markdown in housing is as yet incalculable and worrisome  as the greenbook states and my sounding with ceos confirms there are as yet no appreciable let alone debilitating signs of spillover into the rest of the economy  the economy has been weakened  you see it in the rails and trucking and retail  it has not shown signs of succumbing as much as one might have expected to the fullblown virus that is afflicting housing  as dave mentioned going back to july banks in our district and everywhere else have reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households  the overall sentiment or mood of the country as reported by the press and the surveys is sour  yet we havent seen sharp increases in initial claims low pmi purchasing managers index readings or sharply falling durable goods orders  households are still reasonably optimistic about their job prospects  consumer spending continues to grow albeit at a slower pace  the ceo of disney started his discussion with me this time by saying i hate to be the bearer of good news and went on to cite an internal survey they recently completed that shows that families plan to spend liberally on vacations despite setbacks in presumed housing prices as well as strong ad statistics for their broadcasting network 
there remain widespread reports of labor shortages not just in our district but also elsewhere  the bottom line mr chairman is that there is clearly a fat left tail on growththe economy is growing slower  but the economy is growing at a positive pace  some might say that it has slowed to a sustainable pace  in part this is due to infrastructure investment spending on nondefense capital goods that is better than expected decent if not robust es demand fiscal stimulus and strong export performance that we talked about earlier assisted by superior demand growth abroad facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar  i note that we meet the day after the tradeweighted dollar celebrated a postbretton woods lownot an easy thing for a strong dollar man to note 
certainly there is a risk that downward economic momentum will emerge  i worry about the plight of the big populous states like florida and california under the crush of the housing implosion  i take note of the reports from ups the rails and the truckers as to the deceleration in yearoveryear trends in preholiday shipments  i realize that walmart samestore growth has slowed that mall traffic is down and so on  but not a single one of my thirtyfive ceo interlocutors except for the homebuilders felt that the economy was at risk of falling off the table  fluor and the other big buildersor logistics organizers as i like to call themreport a booming domestic infrastructure business especially in the petrochemical sector  the technology folks as manifested by the earnings reports of microsoft apple and others continue to find that demand is brisk  ciscos ceo confirms that business with all but the financial institutions has begun to flow again after being laid low by the uncertainty of august  the airlines report volume conditions as less bad than they were in the third quarter  upss cfo about to become ceo who serves on president lockharts board is concerned like the rails about consumer holiday demand and notes that transpacific shipments into the united states have slowed  yet when he digs deep into the data he will tell you that the tech side looks good  so the net effect is that while nowhere near robust domestically conditions have not materially worsened 
except for housing and bills two law firms we are not hearing of significant lagging of receivables or collectibles  many of my interlocutors however worry about prices as do our staff members in dallas  we differ significantly mr chairman from the central assumption of the greenbook in our views on headline inflation looking forward  i noticed you cocking an eye in my direction brian when you were talking about the outliers  the greenbook has a 3 percent number for pce inflation for this year followed by a deceleration to a pace of 18 percent in 2008 and 17 in 2009  we in dallas are not as confident that we will continue to experience a disinflation of the momentum of the pce  partly this stems from concerns expressed anecdotally by big importers like walmart who report stiffening chinese prices by the ceo of jcpenney who is planning for cost increases of goods imported from china on the order of 3 to 4 percent next year and by the users of pulp and recycled waste paper that are set to announce a 5 percent increase in essential paper products effective in february having just announced a doubledigit increase not too long ago   
our concern at the dallas fed stems from two morepervasive sources than that anecdotal evidence i just cited and those are food and energy for which we anticipate a more pernicious passthrough effect from recent rapid price increases of underlying commodities  the concern we have for food is encapsulated in the eyepopping chart on page ii30 of part 2 of the greenbook  you have to have a hawks eye to see this chart from that end of the table but it shows an incredible divergence between food prices and the core pce  now this pattern has a historical precedent  a spread of this magnitude between food prices and core indexes occurred on several occasions between 1951 and 1980  in 1973 the gap was 20 percent  in 1974 the gap was closed when the cpi rose up accordingly  but we have not seen a gap of this nature in over a quartercentury  wholesale food prices are up 63 percent for the year to date  through september the cpi for food is up 57 percent  as mentioned by one of the previous interlocutors milk and green grocery prices are rising at doubledigit paces  this goes beyond ethanol mr chairman as a driver of shifts in crop rotation and production  it is occurring against a ramping up of the caloric intake of a few billion new eaters in china india and elsewhere  this is hardly encouraging and it injects a modicum of doubt in predicting a significant decline in pce inflation 
we spoke about energy price dynamics earlier  they further cloud the picture  if you talk to exxon or independence they will tell you that there is no problem in finding oil in refining it or in delivering the final product  they will however note that there are two key impulses at work  first there is no evident slowdown in demand growth according to themthat is domesticallyand the appetite in the brics brazil russia india and china and in the developing countries was described as voracious  an enormous amount of infrastructure in chemical plant capacity is being constructed everywhere from the gulf coast of the united states to the middle east to china and singapore in order to be nearer to either feedstock or growing final demand  any analysis of the income elasticity of demand for oil in low but rising income nations like china and india points to demand for oil that will grow even faster than their slightly slower but still rapidly growing income levels  second price pressures on crude at the margin are compounded by noncommercial activity which we did not talk about earlier  noncommercial contracts the busywork of what are called city refiners in the industrythat is the city of london and the financial exchangeshave of late been running at triple their traditional volume according to exxons ceo driving oil through 90  thus far gasoline and distillates which is where the passthrough rubber hits the consumer price road have been tame in response  bill discussed the low crack spread for example  yet our models at the dallas fed for retail gasoline prices envision increases above 3 a gallon next year if crude stays above 85 which we consider a reasonable probability  similarly price pressures for distillates are increasingly probable  finally while currently high inventories continue it is noteworthy that natural gas prices have reversed their summer slide downward to 550 per million btu and are now quoted at 7 at the henry hub  all this gives me mr chairman a sense of discomfort like that expressed by president hoenig and president plosser on the headline inflation front and is a reminder that the balance of risk is not necessarily skewed only toward slower growth  thank you mr chairman 
 chairman bernanke  thank you  yes sir vice chairman 
vice chairman geithner  are we permitted to question 
chairman bernanke  yes 
vice chairman geithner  richard you described vividly the bunch of forces working on headline inflation  but since you identified yourself as a negative outlier on the inflation forecast it seems to me your headline forecast is still for significant moderation in headline inflation in 08  am i wrong in that  at least i infer from this that youre not showing an acceleration in core pce inflation  
mr fisher  no  but i am talking about a spread being maintained between the two and i am concerned about it depending on where we are going to go in terms of our communication exercise which we will talk about tomorrow  but we dont show as much relief on pce inflation as the greenbook indicates nor as the central tendency indicates and i wanted to explain why 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president yellen 
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  over the past week or so we have been following the devastating fires in southern california  they have burned over 500000 acres destroyed nearly 2000 homes and inflicted seven deaths and sixty injuries  these were large fires even by california standards but they were by no means the largest in recent memory and of course the loss of life and economic costs pale compared with katrina  while the fires have seriously affected the lives of many individuals they do not seem likely to show up in the macroeconomic data 
turning to the national economy developments since we met six yearssix weeks agoactually it seems like just two weeks agolaughter generally have been favorable and the risks to the outlook for growth have eased somewhat  but i think it is too early to say that we are out of the woods  the inflation news has continued to be favorable but some upside risks have become more prominent  with respect to economic activity we have raised our forecast for growth in both the third and the fourth quarters in response to incoming data even though the pace of deterioration in the housing sector has been more severe than we expected and the problems associated with housing finance seem far from resolution  we agree with greenbook that residential investment is likely to continue its severe contraction for at least a few more quarters  we also agree with greenbook that the rest of the economy has held up reasonably well at least so far  exports have been strong and while business fixed investment seems to be slowing it should still make a robust contribution to growth in the second half of this year 
with respect to consumer spending most aggregate data suggest only a modest deceleration so far  such readings help to allay our concerns about potential spillovers from housing to consumption but they dont completely assuage them  survey measures of consumer confidence are down sharply since the financial turmoil began and most indexes of house prices show outright declines  given the current state of the housing and mortgage markets bigger declines going forward are a distinct possibility  indeed the caseshiller futures data for house prices point to larger declines in the months ahead  a sharp drop in house prices would likely crimp consumer spending over time through wealth and collateral effects  some of my directors and other contacts are also raising warning flags about consumer demand  for example the ceo of a large wellknown highend retailer said that the companys sales are softening and that the company is having to work diligently to control inventories  in his view the consumer has pulled back  the ceo of a southern california bank observed a number of his clients talking about a drop in discretionary consumer purchases  the bottom line is that consumption spending seems to be all right for the time being but there is a real risk that households may cut back on spending more than expected in response to higher oil prices a slower economy and economic uncertainty 
i agree with president rosengrens assessment of financial markets  strains appear to have eased a bit on balance since our september meeting with interbank lending markets showing some improvement and spreads on assetbacked commercial paper declining  but structured credits related to mortgages remain quite troublesome and liquidity conditions and treasury bill markets are still at times strained  my impression is that despite having moved in a positive direction over the past six weeks these markets remain vulnerable to shocks and so the economy remains at risk from further financial disruptions  both survey evidence and anecdotal evidence have confirmed that banks are tightening lending standards across the board  tighter terms and conditions are being applied to a range of business lending including commercial real estate and on most household lending from prime and nonprime mortgages to auto and home equity loans 
the main financial variables that are commonly included in formal macroeconometric models appear to have changed since the onset of the financial shocksay in late junein ways that should have roughly offsetting effects  oil prices are markedly higher which should restrain consumer spending and the stock market is roughly unchanged since june in spite of the financial turmoil  a weaker dollar should have a positive influence on growth  mortgages rates on jumbo loans and the rates facing the riskiest corporate borrowers are higher but many private borrowing rates are down because of the decline in treasury yields  of course the current levels of treasury yields as well as the stock market and dollar reflect at least in part the markets expectation that the committee will ease the stance of monetary policy at this meeting 
underlying our forecast is the policy assumption that the committee will cut the funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting  in assessing the appropriate path of the stance of policy i took a number of considerations into account  first core consumer inflation currently is at a level that i consider consistent with price stability  second unemployment is very near my best estimate of the full employment rate  in the context of a taylortype rule these considerations imply that the real funds rate should be near its neutral level  in fact any version of the taylor rule you prefer with whatever rates you want to put on inflation versus the gap will give you the same recommendation because all the terms are zero and drop out except for onethe equilibrium real rate  of course we cannot know the level of the real equilibrium rate with certainty  defined in terms of the pce price index our best estimate is in the range of 2 to 2 percent which is well below the current real rate of about 3 percent   
i would like to highlight two additional points here  first the actual real rate has been boosted over the past six months or so by declines in shortterm inflation expectations whether one measures them by lagged inflation by surveys of expected inflation over the next year or so or by forecasts of inflation including the greenbook forecast  second one important aspect of the financial turmoil is that it probably represents in part a movement toward a more reasonable pricing of risk as seen in the rise in risk spreads  this development tends to push the equilibrium real funds rate down toward the lower portion of the range i just cited 
the bottom line is that in my view even without the contractionary effects of recent financial developments an appropriate stance of monetary policy would involve further declines in the fed funds rate  i have assumed that the funds rate drops to 4 percent by the end of this year and to 4 by the end of next year  my assumed path ends in the same place and embodies the same mediumterm assumption concerning neutral as frbus on which the extended greenbook forecast relies  the only difference concerns timing  we assume a more rapid path to the long run than the greenbook does  our forecast shows real gdp growth gradually picking up to around 2 percent our estimate of potential by the end of next year  however given that the financial shock is not yet resolved i think the downside risks to this forecast predominate 
with regard to inflation i expect core pce inflation to remain around 1 percent over the next several years  the probable appearance of a small amount of labor market slack is likely to help hold down inflation  in addition i expect that with inflation remaining below 2 percent inflation expectations will edge down as well reinforcing our success  i hope that this result will be aided by the release of our extended forecasts and the greater awareness of where we would like to see inflation settle down  i see the risk to my inflation forecast as moderate and mainly to the upside in view of recent increases in oil and food prices declines in the dollar and a slower rate of structural productivity growth   
so in summary i think the most likely outcome is that the economy will move forward toward a soft landing  i see downside risks to economic activity and some upside risks to inflation  but in view of continuing questions about the effects of the financial market shock i am more concerned about the activity side of things right now  
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  like many others around the table my report to this committee in september indicated a sharp deterioration in business confidence  my business contacts were concerned about what may happen  during the intermeeting period i heard less about what may happen and more about what is actually happening  my contacts who are linked to residential real estate have seen a further and in some cases sharp dropoff in business activity  my banking supervision and regulation staff told me just a few days ago that theyre now seeing a sudden and sizable percentage increase in nonperforming loans at a number of large banking companies in my district  to be sure nonperforming loans had been at extremely low levels and most of the sharp rise can be traced to mortgage and construction development lending  but im now beginning to hear reports that bankers are experiencing some loan performance problems outside their real estate portfolio  the ceo of a large major bank in my district has also reported difficulty in securitizing the student loans that theyre making forcing them to keep those loans on their books and to make adjustments elsewhere in their balance sheets  to what extent these banking conditions are affecting overall bank lending is not obvious but clearly there has been some disruption to the channels of intermediation and i am now beginning to hear reports of some spillover to other sectors of the economy  a growing number of retailers tell me that they have seen a noticeable decline in spending since midseptember in items ranging from autos to apparel 
while my reports from the business community reflect a falloff in business conditions from what we submitted to the beige book just a few weeks ago they dont necessarily indicate a significant deviation from the slowdown that was already built into the economic projections that i submitted in september  in preparing for this meeting i found it difficult to judge whether the reports of weakness that i am hearing represent an unfolding of the september projection or additional deterioration in the outlook  in the end i have only minor differences with the greenbook projection in the near term and like the greenbook made only minor revisions to my forecast  i see economic activity a bit softer than the greenbook for the remainder of 2007 but i project slightly better growth in 2008  like the greenbook i have assumed an unchanged path for the fed funds rate over the forecast period  the recent rise in oil prices has caused me to push up my nearterm pce projection but inflation expectation projections remain anchored around 2 percent  i see a small upside risk to the nearterm inflation projection as a result of the continuing dollar depreciation but on the whole i continue to judge our inflation risks as reasonably balanced 
i would like to conclude by echoing the sentiments of others around the table  considerable strains in the financial sector remain and further turmoil in markets is a distinct possibility  i think that in this environment households and businesses can easily be spookedexcuse the halloween punand i dont think it would take much additional tightness in credit markets to push my fragile nearterm growth outlook even lower  so this concern continues to be the predominant risk to my outlook  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lacker 
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  conditions in the fifth districts housing sector continue to deteriorate  sales have weakened further across most areas and starts have pulled back sharply  inventories are rising in part we hear because some residential investors have run short on patience and are listing their properties  the housing correction has been particularly acute on the outer edges of the washington dc metro area and contacts from the area anticipate that additional slowing in morecentral markets is likely  in addition reports of homeprice reductions are becoming more common around my district  until recently the weakness looked to be mostly contained in housing but spillovers into other sectors are beginning to appear  for example our survey of the fifth district manufacturing sectorwhich by the way is larger than the philadelphia and new york manufacturing sectors combinedlaughter 
chairman bernanke  but not texas 
mr fisher  or california 
mr lacker and we dont appear in part 2 of the greenbookposted notably weaker readings for october  drilling down into the details much of the softness can be traced to housing 
mr plosser  we cant help it if you have no predictive content  laughter 
chairman bernanke  the chair is calling for order 
mr lacker  conditioning on the philadelphia index we actually have marginal predictive value for the national isms  but i continue  a modest housing spillover into business investment plans seems to be unfolding as well  in the recent boardcommissioned survey of capital investment plans our district was among those in which more businesses plan to trim rather than boost spending in the months ahead  again a more detailed look reveals that most firms planning reductions have ties to housing  reports on retail sales in the district remain soft with sales of automobiles and building materials notably weak  in addition an executive from a major transportation firm headquartered in the district told us that freight volumes both rail and trucking are now at the lowest level since the 2001 recession  although in a number of district markets commercial real estate activity remains healthy we are hearing scattered reports of commercial construction projects being shelved  one director from dc said that commercial development there doesnt have the pulse it had six weeks ago  the turmoil in financial markets has not appreciably constrained business lending in our district however  contacts generally describe credit as readily available to creditworthy borrowers but some say spreads have widened a bit  on the price front our monthly measures suggest some moderation in growth despite ongoing complaints of higher input costs 
at our last meeting i was more optimistic than the greenbook on the national economy  a significant part of the difference was related to housing where i saw greater probability of the drag receding sooner  longer term i had a somewhat higher estimate of trend productivity growth which supported a somewhat stronger outlook for household consumption  the main shift in my perspective since the last meeting is that i am now at least as pessimistic as the greenbook about prospects for housing bottoming out anytime soon  the 10 percent fall in housing starts in september was certainly eye catching and it indicates that the weak summer housing market tailed off further toward the end  in our district and this seems to be true elsewhere as well the housing downturn appears to have spread into many formerly unaffected markets  it is hard for me to believe that any discernible stabilization is likely before the spring when the seasonal pickup in housing activity typically takes place  even then a prolonged period of depressed activity seems more likely than any noticeable bounceback  other recent news suggests a bit more demandside fallout from the housing market than i had been expecting  manufacturing production was sluggish in august and september and durable goods orders have shown only modest growth especially outside the aircraft industry  i mentioned a minute ago that our survey of the fifth district manufacturing sectorwhich by the way is larger than the philadelphia and new york manufacturing sectorlaughter is showing a significant slowdown for october particularly in housingrelated industries 
consumer spending has been a source of stability during this housing correction and i expect that to remain true over the forecast period  i think household spending will generally expand in line with disposable income but even though consumption advanced broadly in the third quarter it now seems were in for a bit of a slowdown this quarter  in that regard im feeling sympathy for what president yellen said  so im less sanguine overall about the nearterm outlook for growth at this meeting although that may just represent catching up on my part to the greenbooks past level of gloominess 
having said all that i do believe that the effects of this summers financial market adjustments are likely to be limited and out beyond the middle of the next year im again more optimistic than the greenbook and for the usual reasons  i think that productivity growth and thus real income growth will be somewhat higher than in the greenbook forecast and my outlook for the personal saving rate is centered on its current value rather than a steady increase 
inflation appears to have ticked up a bit in september at least according to the cpi  still yearoveryear core pce inflation remained reasonably contained and ive been struck by the extent to which tips inflation compensation has held relatively steady in recent months especially given our easing move last month and the runup in oil prices  while i would like to see inflation come down further im somewhat more comfortable about inflation than i was at the beginning of the year  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  as i have noted in the past the industrial mix in the sixth district looks a lot like the country as a whole  the regional data and anecdotal information show that although the sixth district economy is still expanding the pace is marginally weaker than it was in september  in earlier meetings i commented on the severity of the housing situation in the district  there is no improvement in sight for the housing market and there are signs that the sharp decline in residential construction is spilling over into nonresidential real estate segments such as shopping center development  employment growth is softening as well  although the largest negative effects are in constructionrelated sectors the slowdown in job growth appears to be fairly broad based   
the broad contour of our national forecast is similar to the greenbook baseline  like the greenbook our forecast includes a slowing in business investment  based on our survey of district business contacts it appears that the low levels of expected capital expenditure are due mainly to pessimism about the pace of economic activity rather than restrictive credit conditions per se  specifically financial market turbulence does not appear to have directly affected economic activity but it has created a greater uncertainty about the outlook for the economy  as a consequence the majority of my directors and business contacts are reporting very little in the way of plans to increase capital expenditures in the coming year  where business investment is discretionary most respondents report a waitandsee posture 
more positively the weaker dollar does appear to be having a positive effect on exports from the region  for the year to date the dollar value of exports through the sixth district ports was up 35 percent through august whereas import growth was only 21 percent  not coincidentally the majority of businesses that indicated they were increasing capital expenditures over the coming months were exporters  
in the runup to this fomc meeting i again made calls to a few financial market participants and they reflected a range of institutional and market perspectives  a synthesis of this opinion is consistent with the views that were expressed earlier by bill dudley and others  theres a widespread view that persistent volatility in credit markets is bound to negatively affect the general economy  credit market conditions have improved somewhat but stability may be a long way off  a second wave of volatility may accompany incoming details regarding mortgage delinquencies caused by rate resets in 2008 and theres a suspicion that thirdquarter writedowns may be followed by substantial further losses recognized at yearend  also as referenced in the bluebook there is skepticism about the mlec master liquidity enhancement conduit proposal from several angles 
in summary our soundings of the economy informed by formal modeling work point to a continued slowing of the economy that will likely persist well into next year  anecdotally credit constraints outside the housing sector do not appear to be a major factor at this stage  but uncertainty created by financial market turbulence does seem to be acting as a constraint and i believe that the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook for 2008 warrants consideration of insurance against this downside risk 
with respect to the outlook for inflation i agree with the view expressed by others that recent developments in energy prices if they persist make it likely that we are about to enter another period in which headline numbers substantially exceed the trends suggested by core measures  because of this i feel its appropriate to characterize inflation risk as having increased  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president evans 
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  the seventh district economy appears to be expanding at a moderate rate similar to what i reported at our last meeting  as we talked with business contacts we heard mixed reviews regarding activity across different sectors of the economy  on the downside everyone in the construction industry from builders to suppliers had grim assessments and our contacts with the detroit three characterize the vehicle market as mediocre  another negative is on the labor front  our contact at manpower reported that demand for temporary workers was down a lot  he said that the current market felt almost as it did in 2001  kellys assessment was not quite so negative although they did say that some indicators were flashing yellow  of course the bls has been showing declines in temp help employment since early 2006 and most other indicators point to a healthy labor market  indeed we continue to hear about firms trying to cope with shortages of skilled workers  for instance a couple of heavyequipment manufacturers based in illinois said that they were recruiting engineers from the detroit area  that was encouraging  there were other upbeat reports on activity  united airlines said that all their markets were quite good apparently better than president fisher was reporting earlier  they noted the bookings for business travel which can be an indicator of businesss more general willingness to spend remained strong in october and november  international bookings also were extremely good  we heard numerous reports of strong export demandfor example for machine tool manufacturers and heavyequipment producers  with regard to the financial situation i continue to hear that there is a disconnect between wall street and main street  importantly except for construction our contacts do not see nonfinancial firms being constrained by a lack of access to credit or by the pricing of credit 
turning to the macroeconomy the news on economic activity that weve received over the past six weeks has been better than the downside scenario that we feared  indeed it has been better than what we had assumed in our baseline forecast in september  like the greenbook we have raised our outlook for growth in the second half of 2007 about  percentage point  residential investment does look a bit worse than we thought but consumption came in a good deal stronger than we had expected  also the incoming news about labor markets including the revisions to employment in august points to continued support to household spending from growth in jobs and income  unlike the greenbook we marked up the outlook for activity a bit in 2008 and 2009  our current projection sees growth recovering to a little above potential in the second half of next year and in 2009 
with regard to inflation the incoming price data have been positive and we have revised down our forecast for inflation a bit to about 1 percent in 2008 and 2009  i think the risks to this forecast are twosided  some of our statistical models translate the incoming data into quite low forecasts for inflation in 2009 and 2010 if you take them at face value  but higher costs for energy and other materials the weaker dollar and potential pressures from resource utilization still pose some risk that inflation will come in higher than we currently are forecasting  for me the positive inflation developments are an important ingredient allowing us to focus on risk management  since riskmanagement considerations have played a key role in our policy decisions it is important to think about how the risks to the forecast have changed since september  last time and today dave stockton cited several downside risks to watch for  an intensified fallout from the problems in mortgage finance onto housing demand a substantial drop in consumer sentiment and a spillover from financial market disruptions to business spending  these highcost scenarios are possible but i think their likelihood is smaller than they were in september  we have been pessimistic on housing for a while and for once despite dave stocktons warning i am encouraged that the greenbooks forecast for 2008 has not been marked down materially  it is a small comfort but just a bit  the economy outside of housing seems to have entered the fourth quarter with more momentum than we had thought it would  importantly consumption growth has been solid even though there has been another downtick in sentiment 
on the financial front the greenbook points to the special beige book capital spending questions and to the senior loan officer survey as signals that we could expect more spillovers to nonfinancial activity  tighter standards for ci loans are definitely news but they are hardly surprising  the real news will be next quarter  looking at previous surveys we had one bad quarter in 1998 and then it came down and then the later tightening was part of the increase in the fed funds rate  so i think that the next quarter will be very informative and important  in assessing how risks have changed these surveys need to be balanced against the improvements we have seen in credit markets  while i continue to be concerned about collateral damage from the credit markets to real activity i still think the problems in financial markets are likely to remain largely walled off from the nonfinancial economy  so on balance the economic outlook has improved and the risks of financial contagion have diminished somewhat since september although they havent disappeared  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern 
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  there really have not been any significant changes in economic conditions or trends in the district  moderate expansion is continuing  the special survey we did on financial conditions and whether the changes there had affected capital spending plans suggested that plans at least for firms in our district were largely unaffected  contacts with insight into the shipping industry do report that exports are very strong stronger than at least they had anticipated  that of course is consistent with what we have been seeing in some of the aggregate data 
as far as the national economy is concerned i agree with the greenbooks assessment of the incoming information that we received since the last committee meeting  i wont rehash it here except to say that the surprises have been positive a bit on the upside and i think we stillat least at the aggregate levelhavent seen generalized spillovers from the contraction in housing activity or prices on overall economic activity  i also agree with the greenbooks assessment of the outlook for the economy for the next two or three quarters  i think growth is likely to be subdued as a consequence of the changes in financial conditions that weve seen  as far as prices are concerned core inflation seems to me to be relatively well contained at least on a yearoveryear basis and i expect that performance to be maintained as long as we pursue appropriate policy 
looking at the overall economic outlook beyond the next two or three quarters i think there is a reasonable chance given recent developments and recent actions that by the middle of next year say well be looking at real economic growth of something close to what the economy has averaged over the past six yearsthat is the period 2002 through 2007  this is a bit more favorable a bit higher than the greenbook outlook and as best i can judge the greenbook is more conservative than i am about the nonconsumption nonresidential investment components of aggregate demand  put another way those components add a bit less to aggregate demand in the greenbook than i would expect  but my real point is that i dont think it is a great stretch to see pretty respectable growth by the middle of next year  my reading of the projections package that was briefly discussed earlier suggests to me that at least some have the same view  of course that improvement could occur even sooner given the uncertainty associated with forecasting shortterm perturbations in the economy  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole 
mr poole  thank you mr chairman  i want to concentrate on the outlook for the nonhousing part  i think the housing sector is obviously in miserable condition and the issue as to where thats going to go really depends on how much of it spreads to other parts of the economy  now i have a contact with a large software firm and the headline there is that things are going greatin fact going gangbusters i would say  computer hardware sales nationally are running at 14 to 16 percent above last year about 3 percentage points above expectation  business it growth is around 12 percent  export sales are good  server business is good  computer gaming software is strong  just overall a very bullish outlook there  capital expenditures at this company are up about 35 percent this fiscal year over last fiscal year and are expected to be up another 15 percent in fiscal 2009  so the outlook is uniformly very very strong  the company says it is behind in hiring and has lots of unfilled positions partly as a consequence of turnover 
now all the other contacts were pretty downbeat  ups is expecting a peak season that is milder than in the previous years my contact believes that the economy is not going into a negative but is clearly slowing down  the company is leasing eleven fewer aircraft this year  to meet the peak they always lease extra planes for shipping  they are probably holding about steady on capital outlays  my contact at fedex says that the outlook is very soft not much buildup toward the holiday peak  the retailers that they talked to are anticipating a softer season not an absolute decline but slow growth  international business remains very strong  this company is reducing capital expenditures by 10 percent from its previous expectation  my contact in a major company in the trucking industry says that we are in a recession the worst he has seen in twenty to forty years  the company is reducing its fleet size by 10 percent is cutting capital spending quite substantially and has no good news  a contact with a major money center bank said that the banks analysis of credit card usage indicates that sales have been flat in some areas and are declining in others  credit card usage for department store and catalogue sales has been declining  in an email i received after that conversation my contact painted a weaker picture than had been discussed the previous day  i think that there are other comments around the table suggesting that the anecdotal reports are a bit on the weak side 
now to me there is a puzzle in the markets assessment of the outcome of this meeting  the market has essentially bid in a probability of 10 of either a 25 or a 50 basis point cut  if i were simply following the flow of news the general flow of news putting housing aside has been okay maybe a little stronger than expected and following this fed funds futures market for a long time it does respond to the current information  the flow of data clearly moves that market and if that were all that were driving the market i guess i would have anticipated a 5050 split between no change in the fed funds target and down 25 basis points  so why has the market bid in such a high probability of a cut at this time  ill offer a hypothesis which is that a number of people who are players in this market like my contact at a large bank are looking at news and saying that the proprietary inside information they have on whats going on leads them to believe that the overall economy has a soft tone to it that is not yet showing up in the data that we follow  im throwing out that hypothesis  i dont know what other hypothesis to offer but it does seem to be a reasonable one  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  we have been extraordinarily efficient today  why dont we take a coffee break and come back at 430 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke  lets reconvene  vice chairman geithner 
vice chairman geithner  i just want to start by saying in defense of the empire state that there is no waythe only way that richmond could be bigger than new york and philadelphia is if you dont count the substantial business we have in the manufacturing of financial products 
mr kohn  its a lot smaller business than it used to be laughter 
vice chairman geithner  as the chairman said at the economic club of new york it is likely to emerge stronger  i think the outlook looks about the way it did in september  just a few quick points  financial market conditions are substantially better than during the peak of the panic in midaugust but the improvement as many of you said is still quite limited and uneven  sentiment is still quite fragile and i think we still seem likely to face a protracted period of adjustment ahead as the markets work through the substantial array of challenges remaining 
growth in the united states and in the world economy in my view seems likely to slowmore here of course than elsewhere  here even though the nonhousing nonauto parts of the us economy dont yet show significant evidence of a considerable slowdown of actual or expected demand i think that still seems likely  in our central scenario though housing construction weakens further  housing demand slows further because of the tightening of credit conditions  prices fall further  consumer spending slows a bit and businesses react by scaling back growth in hiring and investment and this produces several quarters of growth modestly below trend  i think that growth outside the united states is likely to slow a bit  it will slow toward potential if not all the way to potential in those economies that have been growing above potential  although the world is larger in relative terms and somewhat less vulnerable to a us slowdown than it once was it seems to me very unlikely that domestic demand in the rest of the world will accelerate as domestic demand slows in the united states  so the risks to this outlook for us growth still seem to lie to the downside  the magnitude of the downside risks may be slightly less than in september but they remain substantial  i think the main source of this downside risk to growth is the interaction between expectations of recession probability and the credit market dynamics  each feeds the other  as the outlook for housing deteriorates and the recession probability stays elevated financial institutions and investors stay cautious  that caution in turn slows the pace of recovery in marketsin assetbacked securitization and structuredcredit marketsand in credit growth more broadly  as expectations adjust to anticipate a longer moresubstantial period of impairment in markets then recession probability at least potentially increases 
i think that the underlying inflation numbers and the measures we use to capture underlying inflation do not suggest any meaningful acceleration in underlying inflation and we still expect the core pce to run at a rate below 2 percent over the forecast period  in some ways though the inflation outlook now feels a bit worse  it feels worse because of the modest rise in breakevens that we saw following our last meeting and because of sentiment in markets around gold commodity and energy prices and the dollar  the fact that breakevens at long horizons have risen or failed to fall as monetary policy expectations have shifted down is not the most comforting pattern out there  so i think we need to be very careful not to encourage any sense in markets that were indifferent to those potential risks  having said that i think the risks to that inflation forecast are roughly balanced 
the range of tools we have for measuring equilibrium combined with what you see in financial market expectations suggests that monetary policy to assess the real shortterm interest rate is at or above most estimates of neutral and therefore is still exerting some modest restraint on growth  the expectations now built into markets imply too much easing over the next eighteen months more than i think were likely to have to do  but i think the appropriate path of monetary policy lies under the greenbooks assumption  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn  
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  in broad outline the situation is evolving as we anticipated in our last meeting  spending outside of housing has been well maintained  the housing market is very weak  financial markets have been returning more toward normal functioning banks have tightened credit terms and standards and core inflation has remained low  i think it is the nuances around each of these that complicate our decision at this meeting 
as dave stockton and others pointed out spending outside housing has been a bit stronger than expected  paths of consumption and investment along with employment seem to be moderating going into the fourth quarter but gradually  importantly the data for september havent been especially weak and these could have potentially been affected by the financial tightening increased uncertainty and reduced consumer confidence that followed the events of august  with growth in the third quarter likely to be at or above 3 percent and no material change in the output gap for several quarters now it does appear that the real funds rate of 3 percent plus that persisted since mid2006 while quite high relative to historical averages was not far from the equilibrium real rate at that time given the low level of longterm rates the ready availability of credit at historically low spreads and the high level of wealth relative to income through this period  it seems somewhere between difficult and impossible to calibrate the effects on aggregate demand of the rise in longterm rates last spring the tightening of credit conditions of the past few months and the expected decline in housing prices  the staff has judged 50 basis points of easingwe did that at the last meetingto be enough to keep the economy near its potential in the context of the relatively solid incoming data  that doesnt seem unreasonable though it does leave the fed funds rate at the higher end of its historical range 
nonetheless i see a couple of reasons for important downside risks to such a growth forecast  first though the housing market was roughly in line with staff forecasts builders have made only a little progress in reducing inventory overhangs  moreover reports suggest that downward price pressures are increasingfor example the constant quality new home index declined in the past two quarters  market expectations for the caseshiller index revised down suggesting that the drop in house prices could be steeper than the moderate drop assumed in the staff forecast  substantial decreases in house prices would at some point revive the demand for housing  at the same time that decline threatens greater spillovers from wealth effects on consumption and from tighter credit conditions as lenders react to threats to their capital from declining collateral values  second although financial markets are improving in many respects the trajectory is gradual uneven and subject to reversal  we saw this just in the past couple of weeks when adverse housing data downgrades of highly rated mortgages and senior tranches and earnings warnings caused some risk spreads to widen out  the secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages are still quite disrupted  clearly uncertainty about the pricing of many of the assets in question about the amount of credit that will get put back to the bank balance sheets and about the size and location of the losses that have to be taken continue to make lenders very skittish  in this environment i wouldnt be at all surprised to see a further tightening of credit availability at banks in the coming months  the developments in housing and financial markets are also likely to weigh on business spending plans as we saw hinted at in the capital spending revisions that some of the reserve banks reported and for households as evidenced by the low confidence surveys 
these downside risks are strong enough that i think they will persist even if we ease slightly tomorrow  besides the influences i already cited my judgment in this regard takes account of market expectations  the markets implied r has been below the staffs and i think the committees implied r for some time now but the gap seems to have widened considerably  in an environment of increased uncertainty about the outlook such disparities perhaps arent surprising and we cant substitute market participants judgment for our own but i did take a little signal from the extent of the pessimism about aggregate demand that i inferred from the interest rate path in the market relative to the staffs path in the greenbook  i dont think r is quite as low as president yellen was suggestingit is perhaps in the 2 to 2 range since term premiums are still low and even with house prices declining the wealthtoincome ratios are still pretty high and the dollar has been falling 
but i did assume a slight easing of monetary policy sometime in the fourth quarter in my projection  i also projected low stable core and ultimately total inflation but i do see some upside risks around this outcome if the economy follows its most likely path  it is still producing at a high level of resource utilization and some measures of compensation and labor costs have been rising  core cpi inflation on threemonth and sixmonth bases has accelerated even if the acceleration hasnt shown through to the pce measures  increases in energy and commodity prices along with recent declines of the dollar are also a risk factorless from their direct effects on prices which are likely to be small but more because they could suggest a potential for a more inflationary psychology that could feed through to expectations  our decision tomorrow will involve weighing these risks the extent of the relative risk to our dual objectives and the potential costs of missing in either direction in the context of the market conditions and expectations built into markets  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  i thought id just talk about four subjects today  first spend a few more moments on the capital market conditions which bill did a great job of summarizing second talk about financial intermediaries and third and fourth talk briefly about implications for growth and inflation  in terms of the capital markets i think it is important that we judge their state today not from where they might have been two weeks ago or from where they might have gotten ahead of underlying realityif you look at credit spreads and equitiesbut from where they were before we last met or from where they were in the darkest days of august  i think these markets are at the very high end of what are reasonable expectations for improvement  as governor kohn suggests it doesnt mean that they cant reverse themselves  it certainly doesnt mean that they are solidplenty of fragility is there  but all things considered as a function of both time and fed policy there is indeed better sentiment bidasked spreads have narrowed price discovery is at work and differentiation and tiering are very real  id highlight a few markets that have gone into the category of being on more solid ground  bill referred to the interbank funding markets  the multiseller banksponsored conduit is performing well  prime auto finance paper has gone through quite a volatile period in the past couple of months but has now found its way to the good side where i think those markets are increasingly open  highquality paper is increasingly being received on terms that dont look dramatically different from the way they would have looked before august  another example is credit card receivables 
of course as many others around this table have pointed out there is no panacea  serious problems remain in some asset markets particularly housing and certain parts of structured finance  but i note that might be for good reason  id hesitate to call this poor market functioning  by and large it may be that some investors dont like the outcomes but as the assetbacked commercial paper markets have separated the haves from the havenots and the havenots are without bank sponsorship and have poorer quality assets and poorer disclosure they are having a hard time finding and securing bids  another example might be some large financial institutions that are rolling over more of their funding on a shorterterm basis than they desire  there may be good reasons for that and as we think about our policy tools tomorrow we shouldnt try to come to the rescue with any fixes for institutions that may not have been managed well or at least may not have had a capital structure that fit the risks  there are a couple of other indicators of continued concern  obviously the treasury bill market has been quite volatile and is a pretty good reminder to us that these markets are not back to anything that wed even want to consider normal  another indicator that i look to in evaluating whether the capital markets are coming back to some normalcy is the percentage of cash holdings in money market mutual funds  in the prejuly period money market mutual funds particularly those that hold these primeplus securities would hold 5 to 10 percent of their assets in cash  on the darkest day in august that was up to 45 percent  by and large my sense is that the average now is something in the mid20s  that suggests that there might be requests for redemptions and liquidations for which they need to keep cash available but they are feeling a little better about their prospects and about some of the paper that theyre holding 
on balance id say its pretty easy for us to sit here and judge improvement  its a lot harder for us to judge success  i think president plosser talked about the normalization in these markets and we must hesitate to think that the markets before their august turmoil were normal  risk premiums were abnormally low and access to credit perhaps unusually easy  so in judging the success of time in our policy prescriptions i think were having a hard timeat least im having a hard timefiguring out what are the new steadystate outcomes that are trying to be achieved  these markets appear delicately balanced between fear and greed  one example of greed as we discussed in previous meetings is some of the payinkind or pik securities with toggle features in the highyield market  one of them was priced just last week between 97 and 98  so some of these corporate credits may well have improved in the eyes of the market beyond what we think might be sustainable  on the other side is fear  a new paradigm is trying to take root in the markets but the risk of reversal remains very real  the marks on many leveraged loans look good  but if you judge the financial institutions that hold this paper they are rushing to get the paper to market as soon as they possibly can perhaps with a view that the corporate credit conditions wont hold at these levels 
second let me talk briefly about financial intermediaries  as we discussed before after the tumult in midaugust many of them retrenched  then many of them tried to reliquefy  at that time they were trying to revalue their securities  now they are probably somewhere in the process of revaluation review and refinement  some of them after the earnings announcements of the past couple of weeks might be going back to step 1 and trying to understand what the risks are and what their liabilities are  some of the improvements that we saw in the capital markets after our september 18 meeting might have been upended or seemed so by a couple of announcements from a leading investment bank and commercial bank that represented a negative surprise to the markets  a couple of explanations are possible for why the market seemed to react not just with respect to the securities of those two banks  were the losses and riskmanagement systems particular to those banks that called the risk management into question or were they illustrative of losses to larger segments of their peer group owing to poor riskmanagement systems  it was probably a combination but i guess the key question for me is whether we are seeing impairment of the entire financial sector or simply the realignment of the competitive landscape  i think the answer is the latter but im not certain  the bestinclass comparables among commercial banks and investment banks seem to suggest that bifurcation is at work  if you look at the credit default swaps at the profits and at the share prices for the best in class of this group they seem to have come out of the scare of a couple of weeks ago stronger and more profitable and frankly in much better shape  i would have thought that those sorts of entities would be putting opportunistic capital to work in a hurry particularly when many of their competitors are down  im afraid that is not the case  even they are playing defense in this market  we talk i talk about the resilience of our capital markets  what they tell many of us i think is that the way for them to be resilient is to be exceptionally prudent here  the riskreward tradeoff for them suggests that this is a time to be careful  you cant succeed if you dont survive and i suspect that many of them are still quite jarred by recent events  the profitability of most of these financial institutions has been significantly called into question  i suspect that the losses in the fourth quarter are going to look particularly bad but i would expect that many of these financial institutions are asking themselves the question of what business they really should be in after all 
third let me speak briefly about the implications for economic growth  to me there is no question that we have less market uncertainty than two months ago and the prospects of some really bad tail events have dissipated somewhat but there is still caution as vice chairman geithner said  certainly large multinational nonfinancial companies excluding housing seem to be holding up well as represented by their bottomup sp earnings forecast for the fourth quarter of next year and certainly theres good news to report as president poole suggested from many in the tech sector  housing is of course as bad as the greenbook has long suggested  so at the end of the day in terms of trying to judge whats going on in the real economy we go back to a discussion the greenbook highlighted for us which is the state of the consumer  even though on balance i am a bit more optimistic than the greenbook for gdp growth for the balance of 07 and 08 i have to admit that the conclusion that consumer sentiment has taken a hit seems at least from my reading and my discussions with some business leaders to be backed up by some very disappointing consumer spending for october  having surveyed a few of the credit card companies i think that it looks to many of them that october spending is really not at comforting levels  nominal spending excluding fuel for their consumer base appears flat to down over the past four weeks  that is i think a rather remarkable outcome  delinquencies have also ticked up a bit but i would say thats probably less disconcerting to me than what the credit card companies seem to be reporting as a proxy for retail spending  the key over the medium term however is job growth and real disposable income in my judgment more important than the negative wealth effects from housing 
let me turn to the final issue for discussionat least on my listwhich is inflation risks  at the end of this sixweek period i must admit to being considerably less sanguine about inflation prospects and risks than the greenbook  it is true that incoming data have not been bad at all  some have even been pretty good and inflation expectations are seemingly anchored  but as governor kohn suggested i worry a lot about inflation psychology and the real effect of importing inflation given dollar weakness and the effect of commodity price increase passthroughs on a breadth of products  given the massive liquidity on the sidelines given uncertainty in the global capital markets and the current political calendar and given the rather large and growing expected discrepancies in interest rate differentials between us and our trading partners i worry about outsized moves between the us dollar and foreign currencies  a disorderly move in the dollar could prove very costly even undermining foreign direct investment in the united states and perhaps threatening to unanchor inflation expectations particularly if the judgments of this committee arent well understood by the markets  i have never been a big believer in looking at artificial levels for prices or at charts to figure out where we should worry  nonetheless i must say a eurodollar move beyond 150 strikes me as a level that the markets will be paying keen attention to  well obviously talk about the policy tradeoffs involving these risks in the next round  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner 
mr kroszner  thank you very much  i very much agree with daves characterization of the greenbook as a modal forecast and i think it is an excellent and perfectly reasonable modal forecast  as almost all of us have said the data are coming in a little stronger  we will have a fair amount of momentum going into the fourth quarter  we will have a significant drag from housing in 08  the financial markets outside of housing have generally had fairly significant improvement although a lot of brittleness remains  a very clear example of that is how the markets seemed to flatten out in the past week or so and certain markets backed up a bit and thus the risk spreads are widening  it is also interesting to note that when the first earnings reports that were fairly negative were coming out there was a positive market reaction because it was sort of a relief that they were owning up to the challenges  now that more information is coming out some of which is more negative than had been expected the markets reactions have been more negative and some of the risk spreads have been widening  that suggests that a lot of concern is still out there and a lot of people are waiting for the other shoe to drop  i will note that i am sure that other shoe will have been manufactured in richmond  laughter 
since this was a modal forecast i want to think about a downside scenario one on which i put a reasonable amount of probability mass and one that i think we should seriously consider  a number of people have talked about bank balance sheets  generally there has been less concern about them than before  one of the big issues that we had focused on earlier was leveraged lending  that seems to be working itself out reasonably well without much incident  there is obviously a lower new flow on but the new flow does have covenants et cetera  so that seems to be working out reasonably  abcp sivs conduitsthere is still uncertainty about how much may come onto the balance sheets although there is a lot more comfort with the extent of the call on the capital that is there but there is still uncertainty as to how much might be called  you know the sivs seem to be working themselves down  they are shrinking through orderly asset sales  but of course what are they doing  they are selling the best assets first so the potential challenges are still left behind  for the banks the conforming mortgages are easy to get off the balance sheets  there seems to be a debate about whether banks are choosing not to get nonconforming ones off the balance sheet or whether they cant get them off the balance sheet  many organizations that have a lot of capital seem to be just originating these wholly on the balance sheet and waiting for better pricing as we have heard reports from other institutions saying that they are ready willing and able to buy at a good price and the supply just isnt there 
nonetheless there is still much more carefulness in the underwriting of those loans  obviously the jumbo mortgages the nonconforming mortgages are more important than they used to be because housing prices have run up so much around the country  417000 doesnt buy you as much house anymore even in parts of the country that dont have or traditionally have not had particularly high housing prices  that raises a concern about a squeeze through the mortgage markets  so i see that the consequence of the financial turbulence is primarily highlighting issues in the mortgage markets as a number of people have said  also as i think the greenbook and bluebook pointed out it is not a problem for highly rated or even just moderately well rated corporations to get funding  that is not a challenge right now  it seems mainly to be coming through the housing market 
so i see a potential for a slowburn scenario coming and for the housing market to slowly play itself out because we are going to have continuing negative shocks  more than 400000 resets are going to be coming every quarter starting with this quarter through 2008  as a number of people have noted we have much higher credit standards than before  many of the people who were supplying subprime loans no longer exist and those who are supplying them are supplying them at much much higher standards  we will be proposing and putting out new rules  the congress is considering new rules  this is all casting a pall over people who might potentially be supplying credit into some of these markets  the delinquencies and foreclosures are clearly going to continue rising at least for a few quarters probablyas analysis by some people at the board suggestspeaking in mid2008  but there is still a lot of uncertainty with respect to that  so it is going to continue to put more and more challenges in this market   
all of these things coming together could put a lot more pressure on housing prices  i think we have been seeing some significant declines in housing construction but i see a potential for a reasonable likelihood of a much larger negative houseprice effect than what the greenbook has  as a shred of evidence for that the incredibly illiquid caseshiller index that is traded on the mercantile exchange if you look forward for a number of markets they have a cumulative decline of 20 percent over a couple of years  now the number of players may be no more than the number of fingers that i have but still it is a piece of data suggesting that it could be lower  the anecdotal reports are that real housing prices are much lower than the indexes are indicating  certainly in the new market they are throwing in a lot of extras addons et cetera and the inventory may actually be larger because the anecdotal reports are that a lot of people are taking their houses off the market so they are not formally included in the enormous inventories that are out there but may well be potentially there for supply 
so what does this suggest going forward  well from a riskmanagement perspective we ought to be thinking about buying insurance against this downside scenario  what is the cost of insurance  inflation and inflation expectations  as most people have mentioned we have seen some gradual slowing and expectations are still being contained but as governor kohn pointed out there is a bit of an uptick in the cpi which is definitely worrisome  but what is the risk  well let us think about the upside risk  i go back to 1998 when the fomc cut 75 basis points  growth was 45 percent in 1998 and 47 percent in 1999  as i mentioned last time we saw very little increase in inflationactually a decline in core inflation  i looked at the core pce in addition to the core cpi that i reported last time and that was effectively flat at 14 16 percent in 98 and 99 and then 16 percent again in 2000  the potential benefit of buying a little insurance now is that given that a lot of these challenges may be peaking in mid2008 it may have some effect down the line  it provides perhaps a bit more insurance against some of the negative shocks that we may be hearing about  if those other shoes do drop over the next few months then we have a lower downside risk for broader financial turbulence  also by mid2008 if the scenario that i am describing or the other negative scenarios that people have described arent materializing we can take back some of these moves  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin 
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  my forecast is actually quite similar to the greenbook forecast  in terms of inflation i see a little faster movement back to 2 percent where i think inflation expectations are grounded but the difference is very minor  i do think the risks are quite balanced around that  in terms of economic growth i am fairly comfortable with the greenbook forecast maybe a smidgen less sanguine in the next two quarters but really not very different  however in terms of the issue of potential downside risk i do think that given the policy path that the greenbook assessed there are substantial downside risks and they come from several sources  one source is that the financial market disruptions have led to some tightening of lending standards  i think that could have some potential effect on business investment  the housing market is pretty grim  we still have a big inventory overhang and there is a question about whether that large inventory overhang is going to lead to even fewer housing starts than the greenbook has forecasted  furthermore it has raised the issue about house prices which have spillovers into household spending  the spreads for commercial real estate are still very high and so there is a question about whether commercial real estate will be as strong as it has been  that is a bit worrisome as well  consumer confidence has not deteriorated too much but it has been on a path of deterioration  so again i worry a little about what the consumer might do  in general i worry more about these downside risks given the policy path of keeping the federal funds rate constant 
what about the financial markets and their disruptions  well i think that there are two elements to the disruption in these big widening credit spreads  one is the valuation risk  all of a sudden people realized that they didnt know as much about what kind of assets were in portfolios and how complicated the structures were in terms of those assets  clearly the solution to that problem is price discovery  we see that happening but it is going to be very slow  so that problem in terms of the credit markets will take a fair amount of time to resolve  the second element is what i call macro risk which is the concern about a downward spiral  the problems in the credit markets will lead to a weakening of the economy which then makes price discovery harder to do which means that you have wider credit spreads which then make things worse  of course thats the issue with the tail risk that all of us have been talking about  i think the policy change that we did in september clearly had a big impact  it did exactly what we wanted it to do  it is almost a textbook case in doing what we wanted it to doit took out a lot of the macro risk  it didnt take out the valuation risk which is getting better but very slowly over time 
so looking at this issue and thinking about going forward in terms of the credit markets i am a little worried that credit markets are still quite skittish  that has several elements  one is the danger that macro risk could come back  so there is a question about shoes dropping  there is an issue about what we might do at this meeting and then there are issues about what might actually happen that people dont know about  one thing that is sort of surprising is that when you look at what is happening in credit spreads they seem pretty reasonable in their steady but very slow improvement  but then you sense some discomfortin particular the reaction to the treasury superconduit has not been very positive  if it worked it would actually reveal information because it would look like the way that the old clearinghouses used to work when they would combine assets  randy knows all about this because he studied this stuff  you pool your assets then you monitor each other and then you actually create information that makes the markets work better  i think that is what the treasury was trying to get at  but the skepticism in the markets is such that they think this could be used to hide information about assets and that other shoes may be dropping in this regard  this does not give me a lot of confidence and so i worry very much at this juncture which i think is a critical one that a policy move could have an effect of sending the credit markets in a bad direction  that is something we have to take into account tomorrow  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you everyone  let me try to summarize this discussion  it is a little harder than usual  broadly the macroeconomic news came in slightly better than expected during the intermeeting period  housing has been very weak as expected but consumption investment and net exports were relatively strong in recent months  in the aggregate data there is yet no clear sign of a spillover from housing  most participants expect several weak quarters followed by recovery later next year 
the risks remain to the downside but may be less than at our last meeting  one issue given all these factors is determining the equilibrium shortterm interest rate  financial market conditions have improved somewhat since our last meeting with investors discriminating among borrowers and with the process of price discovery proceeding  there was general agreement that conditions are not back to normal and that it would be some time before that happened  some suggested that a risk of relapse remains should credit quality worsen or further bad news be disclosed  lending conditions have tightened particularly for mortgages and securitization remains impaired  there is not yet much evidence that this tightening is affecting business borrowing however although financial conditions may have somewhat increased uncertainty among business leaders   
views on how consumption would evolve were mixed  consumer sentiment is on the weak side house prices are down and oil prices are up which suggests some weakening ahead  however the labor market remains reasonably solid which should support consumer spending  anecdotal information about consumer spending was unusually mixed  some saw evidence of growing weakness in consumption  this evidence included weak reports from shippers and credit card companies  others saw the consumer side as slowing a bit but generally healthy  investment including investment in commercial real estate may also be slowing somewhat but again the evidence is mixed  manufacturing growth appears to be moderating  other sectorsincluding energy agriculture hightech and tourismare doing well  core inflation has moderated and there was generally more comfort that this improvement would persist  there was less concern expressed about tightness in labor markets and wage pressures  energy prices and food prices could lead total inflation to rise perhaps even into next year and there is the risk of passthrough to the core  similar concerns apply to the dollar and to export prices  some but not all tipsbased measures of inflation expectations have risen and surveybased measures have been stable  most participants saw inflation risks to the upside but at least some saw them as less pressing than earlier this year  that is my summary  comments   
well again as usual it is hard to be the last person to speak but let me make just a few comments  first as always the greenbook was very thoughtful  the authors have done a good job of balancing the risks and i find their forecast very plausible as a modal forecast  housing does seem to be very weak of course and manufacturing looks to be slowing further  but except for those sectors there is a good bit of momentum still in the economy  having said that i think there is an unusual amount of uncertainty around the modal forecast maybe less than in september but still a great deal 
let me talk briefly about three areas  financial markets housing and inflation  a lot of people have already spoken about financial markets  market functioning certainly has improved  our action in september helped on that  for example commercial paper markets are working almost normally for good borrowers the spreads are down and volumes are stable  one concern that we had for quite a while was that banks would be facing binding balance sheet constraints because of all the contingent liabilities that they hadoffbalancesheet vehicles leveraged loans and so on  that problem seems to be somewhat less than it was  some of the leveraged loans are being sold off some of the worst offbalancesheet vehicles are being wound down  so there is generally improvement in the financial market certainly  in the past couple of weeks there has been some deterioration in sentiment and i see that as coming from essentially two factors  first there were a number of reports of unusually large and unanticipated losses which reduced the confidence of investors that we had detected and unearthed all the bad news  this problem will eventually be resolved but clearly we still have some way to go to clarify where people stand  the other issue which i think is more pertinent to our discussion is about economic fundamentals  there was a very bad response for example to caterpillars profit report and so the market is appropriately responding to economic fundamentals as they feed through into credit concerns 
from our perspective one of the key issues will be the availability of credit to consumers and firms going forward  my sensebased on my talking to supervisors looking at the senior loan officer survey and talking to some people in the marketsis that banks are becoming quite conservative and that is what kevin said  it is not necessarily a balance sheet constraint but more a concern about renewed weakness in markets  it is also a concern about the condition of borrowers about credit risk and the demands of investors for very tight underwriting  now of course tight underwriting is not a bad thing it is a good thing  but from our perspective we need to think about its potential implications for growth and if you like for r  the biggest effect of the tighter underwriting of course has been on mortgage loans although we have seen a bit of improvement in the secondary market for prime jumbos which is encouraging if that continues  this is the area in which viciouscircle effects which vice chairman geithner and others have talked about is most concerning  house prices according to the greenbook are projected to fall 4 percent over the next two years  clearly there is some downside risk to that  if house prices were to fall much more that would feed into credit evaluations into balance sheets back into credit extension and so on  so i think there is a risk there as governor kroszner and governor mishkin also discussed  the corporate sector is not much of a problem  good firms are issuing debt without much problem  i dont really have much read on small business but i have not heard much complaining in that area either  with respect to consumers my guess is that we are going to see some effects on consumers  certainly home equity loans and installment loans have tightened up  we can see that in the senior loan officer survey  we dont see that yet for credit cards but since a lot of credit cards are used by people with subprime credit histories i suspect that we will see some tightening there  so i do expect to see some effect on consumers from credit conditions 
as has already been mentioned an area we also need to note is commercial real estate  financing conditions have already tightened there quite considerably and spreads are much wider  the senior loan officer survey shows the tightening of terms and conditions that matches previous recessions and cmbs issuance has dropped very significantly  you can debate whether or not this tightening is justified by fundamentals  on the one hand vacancy rates remain low and rents are high  on the other hand it is still also true that pricetorent ratios are quite high  if you calculate an equity risk premium for commercial real estate analogously to the way you calculate one for stocks you would find that it is at an unusually low level which would tend to suggest that prices may fall  so it is uncertain i would say  certainly one area in which we might see further retrenchment in commercial real estate is the public sector  tax receipts are slowing and that might affect building decisions  so i do think this is another area in which we will be seeing some effects from credit tightening  i should be clearthe greenbook already incorporates a considerable slowdown in commercial real estate but that means it will no longer offset the residential slowdown 
i just want to make one comment about housing which i think we all agree is a central source of uncertainty both for the credit reasons i have discussed and in terms of prices wealth and other issues  let me just make one point that i found striking anyway which is thatat least from the greenbookthe forecast of a strengthening economy by next spring and the second half of next year is very closely tied to the assumption that housing will turn around next spring  in particular if you look at all the final demand components for the economy other than housing in 2007 those components contributed 35 percentage points to gdp  according to the greenbook forecast in 2008 all those components together will contribute 20 percentage points to gdp  so the fact that gdp doesnt slow any more than 06 comes from the assumption that the negative contribution of housing next year will be much less than it was in this year  it is certainly possibleagain i think the greenbook authors have done a good job of balancing the risks  but as we have noted we have missed this turn before and it could happen again  so let me just note that as an important issue  if we do miss on that turn the other forecast errors for consumption and so on obviously would be correlated with that miss 
finally let me talk for a moment about inflation  i want to share the concerns that some people have noted  if you wanted to be defensive about inflation you could point out that the movement in oil prices and the dollar and so on is in part due to our actions  but it is also due to a lot of other thingsfor example the dollar in broad real terms is about where it was in the late 90s  in that respect it is perhaps about where it should be in terms of trying to make progress on the current account deficit  similarly with oil a lot of other factors besides monetary policy are involved  that said i share with governor warsh the concern that the visibility of these indicators day after day in financial markets and on television screens has a risk of affecting inflation psychology  i do worry about that  i think we should pay attention to that  so i do think that is a concern and we obviously need to take it into consideration in our policies in our statements and in our public remarks 
i have one more comment on housing before ending  in thinking about the turnaround for housing next year governor kroszner talked about resets and those sorts of issues  we spend a lot of time here at the board thinking about different plans for refinancing subprime borrowers or other borrowers into sustainable mortgages  we have looked at the fha and other types of approaches  a very interesting paper by an economist named joseph mason at drexel discusses at a very detailed institutional level the issues related to refinancing in terms both of the servicers incentives and of the regulatory perspective  mason points out that there are some serious regulatory problems with the massive refinancing effort including consumer protection issues because refinancing can be a source of scams  there are also issues of safety and soundness because refinancing can be a way to disguise losses for example  if you read that paper i think you will be persuadedat least i am becoming increasingly persuadedthat a significant amount of refinancing will not be happening and that we will see substantial financial problems and foreclosures that will peak somewhere in the middle of next year  so i think that is an additional risk that we ought to take into account as we think about the evolution of housing 
those are just a few comments on the general outlook  let me just note we will adjourn in a moment  there will be a reception and a dinner for those of you who wish to stay  there will be no program or business so if you have other plans feel free to pursue them  a number of pieces of data including gdp will arrive overnight and we will begin tomorrow morning with a discussion of the new data  perhaps that will help us in our discussion of policy  thank you  the meeting is adjourned 
meeting recessed 

october 31 2007morning session 
chairman bernanke  good morning everybody  lets start with dave stockton who will bring us up to date on the overnight data releases 
mr stockton3 footnote 3 the materials used by mr stockton are appended to this transcript appendix 3 end footnote 3   we left at your placeand i hope you will finda table showing the gdp release numbers relative to the greenbook forecast that we had  i thought i would start out by just walking you through that for a minute and giving my impressions of what its implications are  as you can see there was an advance estimate of thirdquarter gdp of 39 percentthat was 06 percentage point above our estimate for the third quarter  looking at the second line of the table you can see final sales  we were actually surprised a bit to the downsidejust a tenthby final sales  the real area of surprise in this release if you look further down the table to the level in chained 2000 dollars was the change in nonfarm inventories  the bea has a much higher estimate for thirdquarter inventory investment than we do  typically that change doesnt carry a great many implications for us going forward  if anything if we hold inventory investment at the level that we projected for the fourth quarter the higher level that they are estimating for the third quarter would actually lead to a reduction in our estimate of fourthquarter gdp   
going back just briefly to the components of final sales as you can see two areas explain most of the small downside surprise that we had in final sales  personal consumption came in at 3 percent versus the 32 percent we were estimating and equipment and software expenditures came in at 59 percent versus the 74 percent that we were estimating  one other area that came in a bit below our expectations was net exports which is down there in the level area  nathan tells me that his folks would not be inclined to take all of the lower estimate so they would probably be carrying a slightly higher number for net exports going forward 
we had two small offsetting upward revisions  one that was big in percentage change difference was nonresidential structures for which the bea is estimating 123 percent versus 37 percent  that miss was principally in drilling and mining which would have been a big surprise to us in the second quarter  the bea has some proprietary information on drilling and mining  i must say the big increases that they are showing for the past two quarters seem at odds with what we can see in the data that we look at for rigs in use and footdrilled  nevertheless there is not really any strong reason to doubt that  going to the very bottom part of the table you can see for core pce an upside surprise of 02 percentage point  that was all in the nonmarket component of pce prices the part in which the bea is making various imputations  in fact the market part of the core pce came in 01 percentage point below our expectations  again we dont typically give a great deal of weight to nonmarket prices   
so that is the gdp release  i would say obviously it was stronger  i dont see any reason necessarily to doubt this number  it will be revised as data come in  in looking at their estimates for september for which they are missing data we could quibble a bit on net exports and on inventories  those quibbles would be largely offsetting so if we had had this release in hand today we would probably be showing a number something close to 39 percent 
we had two other important pieces of information this morning  one was the adp survey of private payroll employment growth  their estimate for the gain in private payrolls in october is 106000  that is above the 50000 that we implicitly had built into our forecast  again this has significant information content in terms of its predictive content for payrolls they have improved their methodology over the past couple of years as they have gotten into this  while i dont think we would move our estimate all the way to their 106000 we would certainly raise it from the 50000 that we haveprobably to 75000 or 80000 at least for an estimate of payroll employment growth in october 
the other piece of data that came out this morning was the employment cost index  it is showing hourly compensation for privatesector workers up at an annual rate of 31 percent in the third quarter  that is considerably below our estimate of 38 percent through the third quarter and leaves the twelvemonth change in that measure of hourly compensation flat at 31 percent  so that basically is showing no signs of any acceleration whatsoever   
obviously a lot of detail will come out later today and tomorrow in terms of the underlying data and assumptions behind this gdp release  so right now i am really shooting from the hip but i will shoot away anyway  as i indicated i dont think we would necessarily fight the bea on the 39 percent  we would probably mark down our fourthquarter estimate from the 14 percent that we had in the greenbook to 12 percent with a smaller contribution coming from inventory investment  again we would probably raise our level of inventory investment a bit but not enough to prevent the swing from becoming a little more negative going into the fourth quarter  that change if we were at 39 in the third quarter and 12 percent in the fourth quarter would boost the second half from 24 in the greenbook to about 26 and raise the year as a whole from 23 to 24  on pce prices i dont think we would really do anything to our forecast  we would take the thirdquarter estimate on board but we would keep the growth rates of both total pce prices and core pce prices unchanged in the fourth quarter  so we would be adding somewhere between 01 to the second half and 005 to the year as a whole  that might cause the year as a whole to round up just a bit 
i think that is basically where we would be  in going back to my remarks of yesterday i think that these releasescertainly the gdp releasewould not have affected in any important way our basic take on the data which was that the incoming data have been stronger than we had expected at the time of the last meeting  but we still see good reasons for thinking that gdp growth will slow significantly going forward  if we do get 106000 on payroll employment for october as in the adp data the extent of that slowing will probably be a little less than we thought in terms of the overall level of gdp going forward  in terms of the downside risk i think we are still looking at a housing sector that has a significant amount of overhang and downside risk and that could be a bit worse than were expecting 
shifting gears completelyvice chairman geithner asked yesterday about debt growth in our forecast and how it compared with the early 1990s and the earlier part of this decade  i have left a chart of that at your places  as you can see our forecast has a bigger dropoff in debt growth than we have experienced so far in this decade but not nearly so large as the one that we experienced in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s  again i would characterize this forecast as not really having what you would call a fullblown credit crunch but as having some significant restrictions on credit provision going forward  so i will take whatever questions you might have and i will do my best to answer them 
chairman bernanke  any questions for dave  president fisher  
mr fisher  mr chairman i just wanted to askand this is a question based on ignoranceyouve talked about nonresidential structures and you mentioned drilling and mining  one thing that has impressed me in talking to some of the bigger logistics companiesfluor bechtel zachryare the enormous numbers in what i mentioned earlierthe infrastructure developments in the gulf coast area and somewhat in the heartland i think all the way up to president hoenigs district  the numbers are quite large and they continue to surge  would that be part of this nonresidential structure investment number 
mr stockton  yes most of that would be part of this nonresidential structure figure  but since we dont know exactly what proprietary information the bea has im not quite sure what is included in the number  but conceptually that should be there 
mr fisher  and the weight of construction and mining is what   
mr stockton  drilling and mining in the overall economy is very small 
mr fisher  yes thats what i thought 
mr stockton  i mean nonresidential structures contribute about 3 percent drilling and mining i could get for you 
mr fisher  i think the two combined are something like that 
mr stockton  yes its a small piece 
mr fisher  thank you 
chairman bernanke  other questions for dave  president rosengren 
mr rosengren  i had a followup question on nonresidential structures  you talked about drilling and mining and i was wondering about the other parts of commercial real estate  was anything in there  i dont know if you had a chance to look at it but the reason i ask is that if you thought financing was starting to become a problem and you do have very weak nonresidential investment going forward you would expect to start seeing it there  so im wondering if anything was in that breakout   
i have a second question which is that you didnt mention durable goods  but if i thought that credit problems particularly subprime and other things were starting to create issues i would expect to start seeing more imprints in the data for some of the durable goods  so was seeing durable goods a little stronger in the consumption figures a surprise at all 
mr stockton  we dont have the details yet  in fact a constructionputinplace release will come out later today and will provide us with a bit more insight into the composition of the nondrillingandmining component  so i dont really know what is happening there in terms of this particular figure  in terms of durable goods given what weve seen i think that it would still be early at this point for any credit restriction to have left much of an imprint on capital spending or durable goods orders  we are looking for that  we have been a little surprised at the strength there so i think that would be part of a question mark in our own minds as to whether we have overestimated the restraint  but as i said yesterday given the data that we currently have in hand i think it is probably too early to see a significant mark yet from the credit restraint  if we dont over the next three or four months that will more seriously call into question our forecast  now we have not built in a very large capital spending effect from the financial turmoil because we basically think corporate finance is still looking pretty good  there may be some pockets of stress and some difficulties with tighter terms and standards in bank lending but that is not the big area in which we are expecting constraint  it really is the household sector 
chairman bernanke  brian 
mr madigan  mr chairman i would just like to take this opportunity to remind the committee that you will have the opportunity to revise your projections that you submitted a few days ago in light of the information available through the time of this meetingof course including the data that were released this morning  we would need to get your revised projections by close of business tomorrow 
chairman bernanke  thank you  other questions  if not brian 
mr madigan4 footnote 4 the materials used by mr madigan are appended to this transcript appendix 4 end footnote 4   thank you mr chairman  i will be referring to the package labeled material for fomc briefing on monetary policy alternatives  that package includes two versions of table 1  the first is the version that was discussed in the bluebook and the second is a revised version dated october 31  the revised table presents basically the same policy alternatives as the bluebook version but with some changes in the rationale and risk assessment sections  to review alternatives b and c contemplate leaving the stance of policy unchanged today but they differ importantly in their assessments of risk  alternative c characterizes the downside risks to growth as roughly offsetting the upside risks to inflation whereas alternative b indicates that the downside risks to growth are the committees greater policy concern  alternative a in contrast eases the stance of monetary policy 25 basis points and indicates that the committee assesses the risks to growth and inflation as roughly in balance  in discussing these alternatives i will basically be working from right to left across the two versions of the table 
 
 as dave stockton discussed yesterday in response to a question from vice chairman geithner the greenbook projection is a modal forecast  without consideration of risks the greenbook analysis would seem to support the committees selection of alternative c  in that forecast which is conditioned on the federal funds rate remaining at 4 percent economic growth slows in the near term and belowtrend growth over the next few quarters closes the small positive output gap that the staff sees as currently prevailing  maintaining the present stance of monetary policy leads to a gradual strengthening of the expansion over 2008 and 2009 and by enough to leave the economy producing at its capacity  core inflation stays under 2 percent while total inflation runs a bit lower reflecting declining energy prices  judging by your projections most of you would find such a trajectory for inflation satisfactory at least for the next couple of years if not over the longer term  your projection submissions however as well as your comments yesterday suggest that many of you see less vigor in aggregate demand than the greenbook does as well as appreciable downside risksan outlook that might argue against alternative c  the greenbook provided several alternative simulations involving greater weakness in housing and larger fallout from financial stress that illustrate some prominent risks to spending they suggested that the path of the federal funds rate might need to run  percentage point or more below baseline should such weakness in aggregate demand eventuate   
 
 the choice of alternative b could be consistent with a modal expectation along the lines of the greenbook coupled with appreciable concerns about downside risks and a judgment that you need to await additional information before deciding whether to ease policy further  as noted in alternative b section 2 of either version the statement would in effect explain the decision to stand pat first by recognizing that economic growth last quarter was solid and perhaps conveying the implicit suggestion that the economy was likely to continue to expand at an acceptable pace even if growth were to slow temporarily second by noting that strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance and third by indicating that the domestic economy apart from housing has proven resilient and that the global economy remains strong  at the same time the statement would indicate that the committee is concerned about downside risks to growth explicitly citing the potential effect of tightening credit conditions  regarding inflation the language would be identical to that used in september  the statement would conclude by indicating that on balance the committee saw the downside risks to growth as the greater policy concern   
 
 as bill dudley noted the market was all but certain as of yesterday that you will ease policy today 25 basis points  today in response to the economic data released earlier intermediate and longerterm interest rates have risen somewhat however futures quotes still suggest that investors now see high odds that you will ease policy today  thus the announcement of an unchanged stance of policy would come as a considerable surprise to markets  to be sure the assessment under alternative b that the downside risks are the greater policy concern and its implication that further easing might well be forthcoming before long would soften the blow  but a selloff in bond and equity markets would no doubt ensue  moreover financial asset prices could remain volatile for a time as investors attempted to recalibrate their expectations of the probable path of monetary policy going forward 
 
 concern about such market reactions clearly would not persuade you to ease policy at this meeting if you judged that an unchanged stance of policy would likely be more consistent with maximum employment and stable prices and hitching monetary policy to market expectations would make for extremely poor economic outcomes  but especially in circumstances of persisting financial strains concern about unnecessarily adding to those strains might incline you a bit more toward easing as in alternative a if you were already strongly leaning that way today based on your view of economic and financial fundamentals  as i noted yesterday your economic projections suggest that most of you believe that the stance of policy should be eased within the next six to twelve months and many of you indicated that some easing was appropriate imminently  you may see several reasons for preferring to move earlier rather than later  in particular you may think that a timely reduction in interest rates could be valuable now in buoying household business and investor confidence  yesterday the chairman noted the possibility of a vicious cycle involving a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and tightening credit conditions  by bolstering confidence in the outlook easing policy as expected could help reduce concerns about deteriorating economic fundamentals and declining asset values  beyond reducing the risks of nonlinear responses easing policy as expected by market participants would support growth of aggregate demand over time through the usual channels 
 
   of course you may also be worried about a possible increase in inflation  such concerns may reflect a variety of factorsthe further sharp increase in oil prices of recent weeks the depreciation of the dollar accelerating unit labor costs and perhaps the relatively high level of resource utilization  but given the recent good inflation performance you may feel that downside risks to growth are the more immediate danger and believe that further easing today to address those risks is warranted  you may also believe that should the easing eventually appear to have been unnecessary you could act as quickly to remove stimulus as you did to put it in place  if you were inclined toward easing policy another 25 basis points at this meeting you would need to confront the question of the appropriate statement language  in both versions of alternative a the first two sentences of section 2 are similar to those proposed for alternative b  but rather than emphasizing remaining downside risks the statement would then repeat most of the help forestall language used in september  the language proposed for the inflation paragraph in both versions is identical to the corresponding paragraph suggested for alternative b again the language shown in the october 31 version suggests a bit more concern about inflation risks than the september language  finally both versions of alternative a would characterize the upside risks to inflation as roughly balancing the downside risks to growth  this indication might well lead market participants to reduce the nearly twothirds odds that they currently place on another quarterpoint easing in december and might trim the extent of the overall easing of policy anticipated over the next year or so  thus implementation of alternative a also could prompt some further backup in market interest rates 
 
in closing let me remind the committee that the september trial run highlighted the potential for inconsistencies between the results of the projections survey and the committees statement  your latest forecast submissions indicated that while a minority of you sees the risks to inflation as skewed to the upside a slight majority perceives the risks to total inflation as broadly balanced and a moresizable majority judges that the risks to core inflation are in balance  these results could be seen as incongruent with the draft statements for some of the alternatives  for example alternative a references upside risks to inflation  several considerations might explain this apparent inconsistency  for example your responses on skews in the projections survey may capture only the subjective probabilities that you attach to various outcomes while you may see the statement language as capturing not only the odds but also the economic costs associated with those outcomes  or perhaps the upside risks to inflation referenced in the statement should be interpreted as reflecting the views of all members not just of the majority who saw inflation risks as balanced thus encompassing the views of those in the minority who see upside inflation risks  finally i am worried about the possibility that some of you may have provided your numerical projections under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy but may not have applied that assumption as well to your individual risk assessments  in your upcoming remarks you may wish to address whether there is any tension between your own views of the distribution of risks and the risk assessments in the draft statements  thank you 
  
chairman bernanke  brian do i have it correctly that the blue shows the change between the bluebook and the current version 
mr madigan  yes 
chairman bernanke  so the only changes from the bluebook in a3 and c3 are that theres a more expansive description of the inflation risks and in a4 there is simply the phrase after this action  those are the only changes from the bluebook  are there any questions for brian  president evans  
mr evans  brian we dont have a long history of announcing the risk assessments contemporaneously with the decision so im curious as to your take on the likely response  in alternative b section 4 it says that the committee views the downside risks to economic growth as the greater policy concern and i think you said that markets would likely see a funds rate decline as forthcoming  what has been our experience when we have invoked this type of risk and what has the actual policy been afterward   
mr madigan  im not sure i could answer that without doing a fair amount of research president evans  my sense is that as i think i indicated in my remarks for the policy decision today there is effectively 23 basis points or so of easing still built in  so there would be a considerable surprise in that dimension  according to a chart that i am looking at the biggest upside surprise in the federal funds rate that we have experienced since the era of policy announcements began in 1994 has been more on the order of 12 basis points  so that dimension of alternative b would i think be pretty significant  i dont really know how much the assessment of risks might moderate the shock  i think there would be some moderating effect there but it would be limited 
mr evans  so as i thought about this briefly it seemed to me as though its not unusual for us to say that because of the risks of higher inflation we dont feel wed take action in subsequent meetings for quite some time  but when we have had this type of assessmenti think there have been only a couple of opportunitiesusually weve had a decline pretty quickly thereafter 
mr dudley  i think the market takes the upside risk to inflation as more what central bankers have to say 
mr mishkin  the mantra  
mr dudley  right and i think that the downside risk would be viewed as more a hint of the way that the central bank is leaning  so i dont think they are symmetric 
mr evans  thanks 
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin  
mr mishkin  i just wanted to ask you for a little more detail about the markets reaction to the gdp numbers and the adp data  you said that its the same  can you be just a little more precise  is there any movement at all in terms of the assessment of the federal funds rate cut at this meeting 
mr madigan  a very small one i think 
mr mishkin  about how much 
mr dudley  november fed funds futures were up 1 basis point december was up 2 basis points january fed funds were up 2 basis points and then as you go further out they are 4 to 5  so its fairly small 
mr madigan  breakevens were up about 3 basis points across the curve 
chairman bernanke  president fisher 
mr fisher  i have two questions  one just came to mind  we are talking about very recent futures expectations  in light of what you just discussed what has been the range in the intermeeting period in terms of the odds of a 25 basis point cut 
mr dudley  i think it has been as low as 30 and as high asits nested because there is some probability on 50 and some probability on 25  but if you look at the cleveland fed i think it has ranged from about 30 to about 80 
mr fisher  so it has been all over the lot  my question really is maybe not so much of brian but just to inform a decision here or at least to inform an input  there was some discussion yesterday of strong hints about the need to have insurancethat is insuring against the risk of downside economic growth that might be more dramatic than we would like  we did cut rates 50 basis points at the last meeting  david when do you assume that kicks inother than the psychological effect  i infer from the numbers in the greenbook that you see it begin to have an effect on the kind of economic growth we were supposing sometime in the second half or at the end of the second quarter of next year  or what is the lag  we have already bought an insurance policy  the question is is it enough  so im curious as to what your assumption is as to when that actually takes grip in the economy 
mr stockton  it starts immediatelysmall  the mean lag is about four quarters so you get about half of the effect in the first year and the other half of the effect in the second year and that at least according to the models feeds in relatively smoothly over that period 
mr fisher  did it bump up your estimate for the second half of next year in terms of economic growth from where it would have been had we not cut rates 50 basis points 
mr stockton  yes 
mr fisher  thank you 
chairman bernanke  are there any other questions  president rosengren 
mr rosengren  just a followup on your comment about thinking about the release and of uncertainty and risks around inflation and unemploymentit looks as though the nomenclature that weve used in the assessment of risks was in part intended to get at the direction of policy in the future  it does seem a little awkward if the language that were using in the assessment of risks looks different from these fairly stark histograms  since we havent gone through this experiment before seeing histograms that arent consistent with our statement seems like an awkward start 
mr madigan  well one point to make is that the histograms arent in the public release  they wont see those data per se 
mr mishkin  they will be  the histograms will be publishedyes 
ms yellen  not the asymmetry of the risk but it will be described 
mr madigan  right 
vice chairman geithner  i think this emphasizes the importance of the point that brian made about the opportunity everybody has to revisit their submissions particularly in terms of how they think about the risks to the forecast in the wake of a possible move in monetary policy  we havent talked about this in much detail before but if the expected path of monetary policy in the near term changes between when you submit and when we clarify then that might change a bit and i would think would affect what those histograms might look like in terms of the balance  it wont affect them dramatically but it will affect them a little  im not sure it will make them converge fully to the way alternative a section 4 is written now   
mr rosengren  just to follow up on thatwe submitted this last friday right  i dont know if people will know when we submitted it but its not a huge amount of time between when it was submitted and when we are making an announcement  so if there were a larger span of time i would think that awkwardness wouldnt be as great 
vice chairman geithner  i think your point about the awkwardness is right  
chairman bernanke  president poole 
mr poole  i have a process question  in this goround are we going to talk just about the policy decision in the statement or are we supposed to include the discussion of the projections 
chairman bernanke  its a separate agenda item 
mr poole  so it will be a separate discussion  thats what i thought  okay  
chairman bernanke  yes  are there any other questions for brian  if not president lacker  
mr lacker  thank you mr chairman  while the intermeeting period has seen a mix of good news and bad news a substantial amount of good news the net effect on my nearterm outlook as i said yesterday has been negative stemming largely from the continued slide in housing  i have come around to the view that the slump in housing activity is going to be deeper and more prolonged than i had thought  many of you have read the intermeeting news as positive on the outlook  my sense of my shift in views is that i have come closer to the median view of my colleagues around the table about the secondhalf outlook  taking all of this on board my assessment would be that even given the 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate at the september meeting the current funds rate is probably somewhat more restrictive than is desirable  so i would favor a 25 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting along with a statement that contains no tilt as in alternative a and i endorse the passages in blue that highlight the inflation risks 
let me first comment on market expectations  you know they have to influence our decision but we need to be careful about that obviously  i dont think we should ever be afraid of disappointing expectations or putting a new outlier in brians chart  at the same time those expectations are a fact and we have to take into account the likely effect of our action on markets  as i think governor kohn said yesterday they do contain within them some market assessment some information that we cant ignore or that we ignore at our peril  so that had some influence on my decision as well  im thinking that there may be a need for an increase sometime next year if the economy strengthens more than in the staff forecast  in addition i have not lost sight of the risk of inflation increasing  in particular id take this opportunity to endorse the public statement of governor kohn that an increase in inflation would not be in the public interest  laughter 
mr kohn  i stand by that   
vice chairman geithner  that would be intrepid of you 
mr lacker  well im hoping that inflation drifts down enough so that pessimists about adjustment costs will swing around to endorsing a lower numerical objective for inflation  if we see signs of firming inflation or firming growth early next year i would hope for a firmer policy stance accompanied by appropriate communications  so my preference today is a component of a preferred policy rule that has us responding with alacrity should things firm next year  that concludes my statement mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president hoenig 
mr hoenig  thank you mr chairman  ill take just a second here because i realize how difficult todays decision is and that it involves balancing contrasting and rather elevated risks  one risk is that the current housing and financial environment will cascade the real economy immediately into a slowdown and that would cost output and jobs and prove after all to involve little effect on rising inflation  to do nothing in this instance i realize would at least seem to be a poor choice   
the other risk however is that inflation is less contained than we would like to think  aggregate demand is at least holding and looks firm  commodity prices not just energy show a rising trend and are unusually high  the dollar has depreciated as brian pointed out and if it continues to fall will add to further inflationary pressures  unit labor costs are increasing and these inflationary factors are real and show themselves to be present in tips measures and in terms of expected inflation as i mentioned yesterday in a lot of anecdotal discussions that i have had  to ease further in this instance would also seem to be a poor choice  
i realize that the intensity of these two countervailing forces complicates our decision and i know that i might be only one view on this among others who have a different view  but as i see it we are having to choose a policy that involves tradeoffs around these two choices  one choice is to ease now  we would take an action that is oriented toward the short run and the immediate easing could be looked at as an insurance policy as i have heard it described designed to mitigate further the possibility that the current upheaval in the housing and financial markets will lead to an unwanted slowdown in the real economy  if the economy strengthens as president lacker has pointed out we can always reverse that easingso we tell ourselves  the other choice is to hold firm now  inflationary risks as ive described above are real and while they are unlikely to affect us in the short run they most certainly could affect us in the longer run if we continue to ease  if inflation above acceptable levels gets entrenched into the us and global economies make no mistakeas we all have experienced this has happened before  inflation does creep in  it doesnt jump inits a little at a time  also if we ease today and things dont turn immediately we will be reset for another discussion of what the market expects when we come to december  the cost to remedy inflationary momentum later is also highindeed as we all know 
so what is the better choice then when adjusted for longrun and shortrun considerations regarding these elevated risks  personally i think that we should hold where we are  when i analyze how the us and global economies are performing and look at the projections for these economies that we shared here i judge this to be the better longrun decision  we moved rates down significantly at our last meeting  indeed we frontloaded the action to ensure a strong result  also we are very close to neutral if not there i realize and we need to be slightly firm if we are to hold inflation and inflationary expectations better in check  it strikes me that inflation is at the higher end of what most individuals prefer  if we need to move down we can do so later  it is in fact easier to lower rates than to raise them back up  our issue today i think remains for the moment principally liquidity and we should remind the world that we have stepped up to this issue and reassure it that we are ready to meet the need furtherand other needs if necessary  but for now the risks on both sides of this policy decision are elevated and we need to wait watch and be ready to act depending on how events play out 
as to the statement then i prefer alternative b for the most part  i would prefer something along the lines in paragraph 4 that financial markets remain uncertain and then thus the committee will continue    or paragraph 4 in alternative c  thank you very much mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  im sorry  you prefer c4 to b4 is that what you said 
mr hoenig  i do   
mr kohn  including the balanced risks 
mr hoenig  well what i really prefer is that we go back to our last statement but say financial markets obviously remain uncertain and we will watch them  thus    and then bring in the committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other factors without the downside risk   
chairman bernanke  so that is basically the september assessment 
mr hoenig  exactly 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kohn 
mr kohn  thank you mr chairman  i agree with president hoenig that this is a difficult decision between staying where we areand i would have downside risks to growth on thator moving 25 but with morebalanced risks  i think its difficultwe are balancing a number of very difficult things here  on the one hand the incoming data as dave has emphasized have been if anything stronger than we anticipated on the real economy and include data for september and some hints for october in here  on the other hand many members of the committee myself included have a sense that the real interest rate is still a little to the high side of where it needs to be to promote full employment and stable prices over time  we expect the output gap to move over the next couple of quarters as housing holds down growth relative to potential  we expect inflation to stay low and inflation expectations if anything perhaps to edge down as people realize that inflation is going to stay at 2 or below  i wonder whether the 50 basis points we did last time was enough to offset the tighter credit conditions that have developed and the market disruptions that are going to impede particularly the secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages for some time  this stuff isnt going to go away soon and its going to weigh on demand 
partly as a result of this sense many of us think that the risks to growth are on the downside but are still worried about inflation expectations  the risks to growth on the downside are compounded as the chairman and brian pointed out by the sense that financial markets are still fragile and there is the tail risk of getting into the feedback spiral between concerns about the real economy and reactions in financial markets  not the most likely outcome but certainly a tail risk 
as i tried to square several circles at the same time i came down on alternative a  reducing 25 basis points but going to risks being roughly balanced  i see this as preemptive but not open ended  i think that combination of preempting some of the tail risk getting a little ahead of the possibility and buying this insurance is helpful  but going to roughly balanced risks takes out the openended sense that were on a path toward everlower interest rates  i see the incoming data for inflation as consistent with this  inflation has been low even with todays data  i think the core pce has been low the cpi is up a little but not much  i found the eci data kind of interesting this morning  i have been a little concerned about labor costs creeping up which you could see from some of the compensation data  but the eci is a good consistent measure over time  it is not totally comprehensive  also the fact that there is no increase in the growth rate of the eci to me is pretty encouraging that underlying cost pressures are not building  by emphasizing our concerns about inflationthat the risks are roughly balancedwe are signaling that we are not buying into the full extent of the market expectations for our easing and i think that is a good thing  the roughly balanced language will raise the hurdle a bit for ourselves to ease again in december if we have some weak data but it wont raise it so high that if the data are really weak we cant react in a constructive way to change it 
so putting all of this together and admitting that it is a close call i think that alternative aroughly balanced risksminimizes the deviations from where we want to be helps us send the signal about what we think might be coming and what our concerns are and comes closest to furthering economic performance toward our objectives  i certainly agree with president lacker that alacrity will be required  i think i actually called it nimbleness in the speech i gavei want to quote myself againand that will be very much in the forefront as we go forward next year i agree  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president lockhart 
mr lockhart  thank you mr chairman  one of my lifelong purposes has been to make the world safe for ambivalence and indecision  laughter   
vice chairman geithner  how is that going   
mr lockhart  well im gaining ground this morning  laughter  having said that i prefer that we reduce the federal funds rate target 25 basis points  my thought process is that the softening of economic activity at least in some sectors and the lower estimates suggest that the neutral rate of interest may be falling  the downside risks to economic growth and the evidence of lingering liquidity issues are to me good arguments for taking steps that insure against an inadvertently restrictive policy stance 
with regard to the policy statement i am going to continue to use the inexperience excuse as long as i can even though we have some newer members  but just a few remarks  the language in the rationale section of alternative a most closely reflects my assessment of the situation but i am not entirely comfortable with any of the options for the assessment of risk  the real economic outlook faces uncertainties on the downside that are difficult to characterize  because of that i am skeptical that we can credibly claim nearterm downside growth risks to be roughly in balance with upside inflation risks as is done in alternatives a and c  that said i worry that the wording in alternative b would be interpreted as a rather significant loss of confidence in the economy and a signal that another rate reduction is probable in the near term  at this point id prefer not to send a signal that another rate cut is most likely in december 
since our last meeting expectations were centered on no change in the fed funds target today until a string of weak housing and earnings reports moved the probabilities strongly in the direction of a rate reduction  thus judging from the evolution of market expectations since our september meeting the assessment of risk language in our last statement was sufficient to convince financial market participants that our decision on the funds rate is being driven by incoming data  as i said i think the assessment of risk statement should try to recognize the uncertainties inherent in our growth forecastsand those uncertainties are greater than those associated with our inflation forecastbut without tilting expectations in favor of a future rate cut  as i said in my remarks yesterday it is quite possible that we will enter another period in which headline inflation numbers exceed the trend suggested by core measures  if that is even a shortlived problem my opinion is thatand this is based on the bluebook versionwe would be well served to note that fact by adopting the language in alternative c section 3  however i do note that the new language as presented this morning in alternative a section 3 is quite helpful because it largely incorporates the language in alternative c  thank you mr chairman  
chairman bernanke  thank you  president poole 
mr poole  mr chairman thank you  two weeks ago i was pretty adamant in my own mind that the recommendation i would be offering was no change but i have reluctantly tilted in the other direction and favor a 25 basis point cut  i have changed my mind because of really two things  first in my discussions with our directors in my phone calls before the meeting and around the table yesterday i think there has been fairly pervasive anecdotal information indicating a soft economynot disastrously weak but just soft certainly softer than the hard data that have been coming in  second the financial markets are still unsettled and with the markets putting a very high probability on action i am concerned about the effects of violating that market expectation  i ask myself how big a risk it would be to violate the market expectation and i am not really sure  but i am not sure that i want to find out either  it is just not a risk that i really want to run 
that said it is very important that we understandi think everybody does but i want to state itthat there can be no equilibrium in the economy if all we ever do is follow the market expectation  we have to get out front and we have to help define what that market expectation is going to be  i think there are a number of things that we could do coming up to the december meeting not only in the statement but also in speeches and comments that we make  i favor the alternative a language for the most part but i am a little concerned about the assessment of risk statement  if it is really true that upside risk to inflation is mantra then what is operative in the statement is downside risk to growth in terms of shaping market expectations about the committees direction in the future 
as i try to think through the downside risks to growth in the coming weeks or the next few months we cant really do anything about what is going to happen in the remainder of the fourth quarter or the first part of next year  but when i think about the period over which the policy action makes a difference i am not sure that the risks are really skewed to the downside  we could well see the recovery of normal market processes proceeding plus the lower interest rates giving more or less equal probability in the second third or fourth quarter of next year of a 50 basis point upside surprise or a 50 basis point downside surprise in the growth rate of gdp 
so i would like to see us work on the language for paragraph 4  given that paragraph 3 includes risks to inflation we might concentrate just on the growth risk and we might say something like after this policy action the upside and downside risks to economic growth in coming quarters are roughly balanced  because i think this will be the thing that the market keys off of in terms of a hint about our future policy or likely policy direction  i would like to see us go as far as we can in the direction of saying that we think weve done enough at least for the time being  lets sit wait and see what happens providing that the information comes in more or less as expected and we dont have any big surprises on that 
looking further ahead we are at a point where we are really within reach of bringing the inflation rate down to about 1 percent on a longrun basis  were also at a point that in coming meetings we could throw that option away  if we go too far or hang on with lower rates too long then were going to end up eighteen months from now looking at a situation in which we have rekindled some inflation pressures  so this is a critical time in terms of not going too far and also of being willing to take back some of these cuts  i guess the way i look at it is that if 5 percent was the appropriate funds rate in july or june before the financial distress really took hold it probably cant be too far off where we want to be once the financial turmoil is largely over  we are going to end up substantially below that if we cut 25 basis points today  so i think its important that we not go too far and that we try to set market expectations that we have this much longer run view and that were not just reacting to the very short run data on the real economy  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president plosser 
mr plosser  thank you mr chairman  the last time we sat around this table i and many of you argued for what the markets described as a surprisingly aggressive 50 basis point rate cut  at that time the baseline greenbook forecast was for 25 basis points 25 in subsequent meetings and then flat thereafter  our rationale was that we were trying to act preemptively trying to get ahead of the curve to limit some of the potential spillover effects from what we then believed to be a weakening housing market perhaps a somewhat softer labor market and the financial turmoil  we also argued that higherthannormal tail risk loomed out there that it was associated with the financial market meltdown and that it warranted aggressive action to help forestall the possibility of that  in the forecast that we submitted in september and we all submitted a forecast the appropriate policy varied  nine of us submitted appropriate policy as being consistent with the greenbook which was 25 25 and then constant  of the remaining eight seven of us had a 50 basis point cut in september which we did  many of those including myself had some further cuts to the funds rate but further out in the economy more like in 08 later in 08 and 09 as we move toward morestable inflation expectations coming down a recovered economy and so forth  i was certainly in that camp as well and in fact most people ended up with a funds rate forecasted at either 4 or 4 percentlittle differences but not much  in september only two of us anticipated appropriate policy as dropping 75 basis points before the end of 07   
of course we all have the luxury fortunately of changing our minds in response to data and other things and certainly all of us are doing our best to read the tea leaves of the economy both aggregate and within our regions and that influences the color and texture that we put around our forecast  we all work very hard at that and i respect those efforts  but i think it is important that as a committee we enforce discipline and systematic behavior on ourselves as our views evolve particularly as those views influence policy choices  without that discipline without that systematic behavior i find it very difficult to figure out how i am going to communicate to the public about what monetary policy is doing and why  it makes both our commitment and our credibility either to inflation or to employment growth more difficult to substantiate  it makes transparency in general more difficult  all of those thingscommitment credibility and transparencyare important elements of what contributes to a stable economic environment  now i have tried to impose that discipline about policy on myself by focusing on the incoming data trying to focus on how those data cause me to revise my outlook for the real economy not for tomorrow or next month particularly but for the coming quarters  after all the monetary policies we have just been talking about operate with somewhat of a lag  in that sense i think there has been a lot of discussion by myself and others around the table that we are datadriven that we are forecastbased in how we think about our policy choices and that we try to take a somewhat longer run view  i think that view is important to communicate to the public 
i suspect that at the end of our last meetingcertainly i can speak for myselfmany if not most of us probably would not have anticipated that we would cut again at this meeting  perhaps some of you did  certainly your appropriate policy paths in our forecast at the last meeting didnt suggest that  but we wouldnt have anticipated cutting unless we thought that the outlook for the economy had noticeably deteriorated  so what has really happened since the last meeting  well the collective forecasts that we submittedin terms of risk assessments ranges medians and however you want to look at themhardly budged  the greenbook forecast didnt change very much  the economy generally had betterthanexpected news on many frontsnot hugely better but certainly the surprises were on average to the upside for most of us given our forecast from last time  i thought we generally agreed that the risk of serious financial meltdown while perhaps it hadnt vanished had mitigated at least somewhat  as a consequence neither the greenbook nor our collective fomc forecasts moved very much  to the extent that they did they actually moved up a little 
based on that forecast and on the data that came in im in a very troubled position in figuring out how to justify in my mind additional rate cuts at this meeting  had this meeting been held two weeks ago as president poole suggested before the markets reaction to the writedowns in some of the financial institutions before the fairly dramatic flipflop in the fed funds rate futures market about the assessment of a future rate cut i certainly would not have been in favor of a rate cut at that time and i suggest that each of you should ask yourself the question that bill did  would i have chosen to cut rates at that time  i certainly would have also resisted the temptation arising from those data and what has happened over the past two weeks to be in any great rush to think we needed to call a special meeting of the fomc to consider additional rate cuts  my attitude would have been that these financial markets are volatile and they are bouncing around an awful lot we understand that there are risks but lets wait and get the data on the real economy and see how it is evolving and make appropriate decisions at the time  what worries me is that we run the risk of being whipsawed here by market expectations or by the financial markets that are moving around in a very volatile way  that leaves me with some concern that we may be putting ourselves in a position of either responding too much to these volatile markets or being accused by markets of being bullied by the financial markets 
so at this point my take is to say that we are going to get a lot of data between now and december  we are going to get two more employment reports as we have discussed  we are going to get some more information about retail sales and consumption  i would prefer to keep my own approach to disciplinebased policymaking by looking at the forecast and waiting for the data to tell me whether my forecast deteriorated significantly  if it has i will be the first to argue for an additional rate cut in december if i think it is called for   
right now we have a difficult time justifying a decision  on what grounds are we going to justify it particularly in a more systematic fashion  i think that creates problems for us  as we have already been discussing it is creating somewhat of a problem in the language of the statement and i will come back to that in a minute  but i also think that without a very articulate rationale in the data and in reasoning that supports a systematic approach to policy we run the risk of being capricious or arbitrary  i think we are in a situation as kevin warsh said yesterday and tom hoenig spoke about when many of us view inflation risks as more fragile perhaps than they have been recently particularly more fragile in an environment in which we are cutting rates  i think that we run the risk more so now perhaps than in other times that inflation expectations might be at risk  i dont want to raise those inflation expectations  they are much harder to get down  you cant act nimbly to deal with movements in expected inflation   
i also think we have to ask ourselves the questionand this ties into the balance of risks issueif we choose to cut today when our forecast hasnt declined and suppose the data between now and december look as they have for the past six weekskind of in line with what we expected not much different one way or another with nothing really falling out of bed or boomingon what basis in that meeting would we choose or not choose to cut again  at this meeting we have had a hard time grappling with the criteria that we are using  if we are not very explicit about those criteria we could find ourselves in the same boat next time  i think this is related to toms point that once we start on the path of making explicit what our expectations are or what the market is going to be expecting us to do without having a firm basis for saying we are doing this because of x or y we are going to find ourselves in an awkward position in december 
so i share brians concern about the assessment of risk language in alternative a being balanced when it seems to be out of touch with the way the committee has described things  again i think that puts us in an awkward position of trying to balance those two things  so with that i appreciate the time mr chairman  on net i am troubled by a cut today  i would much prefer to wait until december and to assess the data that come in  if a 50 basis point cut in december is required so be it but i feel as though we would have a firmer basis then for making that decision  thank you 
chairman bernanke  thank you   
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  yes vice chairman 
vice chairman geithner  let the record show i am asking this with a smile  president plosser you are not really suggesting that your colleagues if they have evolved in their view are undisciplined unsystematic or capricious in their rationale for that evolution are you 
mr plosser  no i am just saying that the communication of that rationale is tricky and i did say that people are making their best efforts to make their forecast  i explained my view of how i discipline my forecast and how i discipline my policymaking   
vice chairman geithner  just to clarify about the submission you presentedyou have as i think you said yesterday a 25 basis point cut early in the year in the first quarter 
mr plosser  first quarter perhaps but that was conditioned on inflation and inflationary expectations remaining well behaved 
vice chairman geithner  thank you 
chairman bernanke  president yellen 
ms yellen  thank you mr chairman  i found the choice between alternatives a and b to be a tough call  ive struggled with this over the past week and in the end i find the arguments for alternative a for a 25 basis point rate cut more persuasive  i have several reasons for this judgment 
first as i argued yesterday further action to my mind is appropriate even leaving aside the recent financial shock  with output near potential and inflation near my objective the stance of policy should be close to neutral and while we can debate exactly what the equilibrium real interest rate isthats an important discussion to meit appears that even after our action in september policy is somewhat restrictive  i agree with president plossers view that we need to maintain some consistency in our thinking over time and i would say that i expressed this identical view at our last meeting and said at that time that i did envision a 75 basis point cut during 2007  so my views havent changed and the data that we have seen in the intermeeting period havent suddenly pushed me in the direction of this moveinstead if anything slightly away from it but i regard those data as largely uninformative  so my views really havent changed about this but it seems to me that the argument that we should be moving toward neutral does allow for quite a bit of flexibility in the timing of an additional rate cut  it doesnt have to be something that we do in october  we could do it in december or it could wait until january  so that argument in and of itself doesnt completely persuade me that we have to do it today 
but i do think it would be prudent to act today for a couple of reasons  the first has to do with the effects of the financial shock of the summer  when we came into the meeting last month we faced credit conditions that were quite restrictive and our goal was to offset that shock to avoid a significant economic slowdown  i think the favorable inflation results over the previous six months did give us the flexibility to take strong action which we did  my judgment is that we have had some success so far  financial conditions appear to be easier than they were in september and arguably as i said yesterday i think we may have roughly neutralized the shock  but an important element in our success has been the decline in treasury rates along with the further decline weve seen in the dollar and the increase in equity prices since we last met  those changes are supported by the markets expectations that we will ease further at this meeting and beyond  in other words if we dont ease today as the market expects then rates may move up and that raises concern to my mind about whether we will have accomplished the goal of offsetting the restrictive effects of the recent financial shock  a second reason for easing today is the asymmetric nature of the risks we face in achieving our goals  i do see some upside risk to inflation although i have not read the recent increase in fivetotenyear inflation compensation as really reflecting a market perception of a deterioration in longterm inflation expectations  in my view the more serious risk is the one that our chairman discussed yesterday of unleashing negative nonlinear dynamics in the real and financial economy that could be difficult to reverse  conditions in housing markets and their possible implications for housing prices and in turn consumption are at the center of these concerns  in addition although liquidity in financial markets has improved i think the markets are still rather fragile and subject to further sudden disruptions 
im comfortable with the wording in alternative a including the balance of risk assessment  through the fed funds rate being 25 basis points lower i do see the upside risk to inflation as being roughly balanced with the downside risk to growth  i think the statement does give us sufficient flexibility to respond in whatever way we need to and that includes the possibility of taking back some of this easing should there be upside surprises  i do think that its important to signal to markets that this is not yet another step in a planned series of continuing rate cuts 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president rosengren 
mr rosengren  thank you mr chairman  i too find myself torn between alternative a and alternative b and have been anguishing over them much of the last week figuring out where i come out  the economic outcome detailed in both bostons and the boards forecasts with no change in interest rates seems reasonable  the evidence since the last meeting indicates that there may have been more strength in the real economy than we expected in the third quarter and financial markets have been recovering but they are certainly not back to normal  the risks are clearly on the downside and our forecast expects a weak fourth quarter  so certainly an argument for alternative b is to cut when it is clearer that the fourth quarter will be weak or we have data of moresignificant collateral damage from the housing sector  the argument for alternative a would seem to be that we should take out more insurance against the downside risks  the costs for such action are not great and given the downside risk some additional insurance is not unreasonable  however we have discussed the modal forecast at some length but our rigor around the tail is quite limited making it difficult to determine how often and how much insurance should be taken out against downside risk  thus i prefer to wait until there are more data that the economy is weakening which i think is likely to happen 
just to comment on the assessment of riskswhen i look at the uncertainty in terms of gdp growth i think of the histograms  thats quite stark  if the major concern we have is downside pressure on prices of housing which is my concernthat housing prices continue to decline and housing gets much worsei think 25 basis points is probably a small premium to pay  but i doubt that i would change where i would put the weighting even with a 25 basis point cut  i think the housing scenario that is detailed in the greenbook will still be there whether or not we cut the 25 basis points and my guess is that between now and december well have more confirmation that it is a concern 
whatever we do in terms of the language we need it to be consistent and accurate and i am a little worried about the language in alternative a being consistent and accurate with what we are going to portray in our uncertainty of risks if we show those histograms  so if were showing the histograms regardless of whether or not we have a 25 basis point cut i think the alternative b language is more consistent with at least what we put down  unless people think that with the 25 basis point cut there is a big shift in the uncertainty and the risks to gdp growth i do worry about how that will play out in the market and what kind of a tension there will be 
chairman bernanke  president lacker 
mr lacker  if the language in alternative a section 4the assessment of riskwere simply about the likelihood of rate changes in either direction and didnt say anything about growth and inflation would you view that as inconsistent with the assessments in our projection 
mr rosengren  no  if the goal is to try to convey that we arent necessarily going to cut rates again that is different from an assessment that theres a downside risk that housing will get much worse  so whatever we put in that should reflect what we actually want to convey and certainly shouldnt be inconsistent with histograms that were going to be publishing at the same time 
mr lacker  i asked this mr chairman because ive said this before on a couple of occasions  the awkwardness about the assessment of risk statement is that it talks about rates but it talks about them using a code about growth and inflation rather than talking about the rates themselves 
chairman bernanke  just for clarificationand brian you can correct mewe are not going to publish the histogram showing the risks  we will describe verbally generally speaking the committees views  president evans 
mr evans  thank you mr chairman  i find myself in agreement with so many things that have been said already no matter how the conflict may appear  this is a close call  i think its a tough decision  i have frankly gone back and forth in thinking about the nuances here  it is the case that the data have been better than i expected at the time of our september meeting  the adp report this morning sort of continues that  it didnt have to work out that way but 106000 is a pretty strong number  im still trying to figure out exactly how to project that to payroll employment  the bad news that we have seen in terms of surveys has hardly been surprising given our views and what we would have expected in september  so i found myself grappling with many of the ideas that president plosser was talking about earlier in terms of data dependence and our decision and discussion in september  one view is that 50 basis points in september was seen as enough and we would be judging our future actions on the basis of deterioration in our forecastdata that come in worse than that or some information about risks that are hard to quantify but we thought would be important  i havent seen the impetus for that  so thats one view  then the other view is the riskmanagement perspective  maybe many people president yellen included thought that more than 50 was required but only 50 in september was really achievable without startling markets  so theres a tension there   
mr chairman i really enjoyed your speech in st louis when you talked about different responses to different types of uncertainty  with the sort of standard brainard response when the economy might be changing but we have a lot of uncertainties we go slowly and we look at it  juxtaposed against that are other types of risk such as the financial risks where things could be moving much more quickly and we dont fully appreciate the potency of policy and what we can do against certain tail risks  in that case the robust control type of approach suggests that we should do more then in the event that we find that policy is very effective we can reverse it  of course reversing it is importantwe talked about that last time too   
it seems to me that were close to the limits of initial risk management  thats how ive thought about this and i thought that governor kohns comment that we shouldnt view this as an openended commitment to risk management was very important  after all how can you ever argue that more insurance wont help against some catastrophe some unforeseen tail risk that hasnt yet happened  there is a lot of value to setting a benchmark stopping point for how you would respond to that tail risk  then if other evidence intervenes to make you reassess the likelihood of that tail risk or the cost of it then theres reason to do more  but i think theres value to putting the benchmark out there  another way to stop this insurance is if we end up balancing the risk  the actions taken move our inflation risk up and weve had some concerns about that  im actually pretty comfortable with the inflation risks and people have reminded me that im pushing this pretty far  ive taken more comfort from our ability to forecast inflation than perhaps others wouldit seems to have a pretty reasonable trajectory  but as we continue to move toward moreaccommodative policy in the hopes of addressing a tail risk i think those risks go up too 
as i looked at table 1 and i struggled with the rate decision it seemed to me that the balance of risks was more important and what got my attention early on was the risk assessment under alternative a  i thought it was important to project our assessment that risks were a little more balanced  i can easily imagine that well have reasons to reduce the fed funds rate because we think that r is lower but its purely opportunistic to take advantage of that now  we could have done that several meetings ago but we can do it opportunistically  so im okay with the action of 25 basis points today and i think that the balanced risk assessment is important  we probably do need to think about the linkages with our projections i hadnt really taken full account of that myself  that will put me and i hope many of us much closer to the views that president plosser expressed in terms of data dependence because i think that the risks will be balanced in how the data continue to roll out in the intermeeting period  so thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor mishkin 
mr mishkin  thank you mr chairman  i take the view that a cut today is justified on the basis that keeping rates where they currently are leaves us with a lot of downside risk  thats exactly what ive been hearing from other people  if there is in fact downside risk why not move today  i would be very troubled by not changing and still using the language in alternative b because it says theres a lot of downside risk  then there is the problem of why we are sitting there and not doing anything  on just the straight economic issues i think that a cut could be justified  in particular i was one of the people who advocated a cut at this meeting  in fact i was being a biti dont know what the right word isflamboyant when i suggested a cut of 50 basis points and then that we might move back up 25 basis points  i was trying to make the point that i was very concerned about the macroeconomic risk the potential for a downward spiral of financial disruption leading to problems in the real sector and then feeding back on the financial markets and really felt that we needed to keep ahead of the curve 
what is key is that the response to our actions on september 18 was almost textbook perfect in the sense that the markets really got the message that we were not going to be asleep at the wheel  as a result the macro risk was taken out of these markets and we achieved exactly the kind of signaling that we intended  so clearly i do not feel that we need to get ahead of the curve in that sense the way i did last time  also very important in my thinking about the macro issues is that i think inflation expectations are contained  we have been able to achieve that  in particular there is a bit of concern about inflation compensation having gone up in terms of the spread between nominal rates and tips  but the analysis that ive heard from people who are much more knowledgeable about the way yield curves operate is that the way to interpret this is that theres an increase in uncertainty about what inflation would be  i hope that our communications strategy will help in that regard  in fact that provision of information will actually help the markets in the current environment  furthermore the michigan survey has if anything gotten better in terms of inflation expectations  i always get a little nervous about asking regular people what they think because if you ask them what theyre watching on tv theyre never going to tell you that theyre watching vanna white  theyll tell you that theyre watching ballet or the history channel  laughter  but i dont see a problem there and that the eci numbers came in the way they did also gives me some confidence on the inflation front 
i am very concerned about charlies issuei always call president plosser charlie because we have known each other such a long timeabout being led by the markets  it is very important that we not get into that box  i worry about that but i am a bit less worried about it in this context in that we affirmed last meeting that we were not being led by the markets because we sure as heck surprised them  so the fact that we dont surprise them this time to me does not create a pattern that were just doing whatever the market tells us 
i also want to raise a consideration that i think deserves some emphasis which is thinking about scenarios of what may happen  this relates to what bill talked about but i want to be a little more explicit  i want to ask myself what might happen as a result of our policy actions today and what the implications might be for the economy  in particular lets think about the case of our doing alternative b  in that case i think there is a significant probability that the markets would react quite negatively and that the macro risk that we took out by our action on september 18 might creep back into the credit markets  im actually very worried about the skittishness of the credit markets  when youre in a financialdisruption type of world things are much more nonlinear  so i would have no disagreement at all with charlie on the issue that if you are in a normal situation then you definitely do not want to be led by the markets at all  but i think that we do have to worry about market considerations a bit more in the current situation when we could have a negative reaction to what we do  that creates problems in the credit markets and then that weakens the outlook for the economy and there is an issue about what do we do then  if we then cut in december and cut more than 50 basis points thats really bad  or if we dont cut and things head south that could be very very problematic 
but i do not think that cutting today will have very negative effects on inflation expectations  however i do think that the issue of going forward is very important and this relates to the statement  i strongly agree that we need a much stronger balance and an indication that our action todayif we do what i suggest which is to cut 25 basis pointsdoes not mean that we expect to cut at the next meeting or further out  we really need to make that very clear  the statement will be one part of it although i worry very much about the issue that we always put much too much weight on the statement and that we dont have other means of communicating  im not sure what to do about this ive been thinking about it and havent come up with any good answers  but there are issues in terms of how other central banks communicate things beyond the statement that are hard to communicate with fifteen words rather than something more extensive 
so my viewand it is reflected in my projectionsis that if we cut 25 basis points its not clear to me that the balance of risks is so much to the downside  i think the risks to the downside have been very substantially eliminatednot that they arent still there to some extent  i think they are but not really as much and i think that is true of the actions on september 18 and today  because im never very precise in my languageas you know i tend to say pitiful thingssomebody will craft this much better than i do  but im wondering about the assessment of risk  let me make a suggestion although im not sure this is the best way to do it  we need to emphasize that its not just the upside risks to inflation but also the downside risks to the economy that have lessened  it is also important when we have a 25 basis point cut not to say to the markets that were so worried about the economy  one possibility might be for example to say that the committee judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the somewhat reduced downside risks to growth  so we would not be saying that there isnt some downside risk but that its not really as strong as we thought  its certainly not as strong as we thought on september 18  but i think that with this kind of reduction in rates it would reduce the risk  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  its a little past 1030  coffee is available  why dont we recess until 1100  thank you 
coffee break 
chairman bernanke  lets recommence with president fisher 
mr fisher  thank you mr chairman  flying home last time i thought it would have been nice to have been at the bank of china and cut 37 basis points  laughter  i dont want to repeat what has already been said at the table because so much has been said  but it is important to note that since we last met the data on the economy are stronger  some of us have expressed concerns about inflation  credit markets as i said yesterday are at least in remission if they havent fully recovered and are in better shape than they were  listening to the arguments i took particular note of president pooles comment that hes not sure that he wants to find out what the market reaction would be if we did not cut rates 25 basis points  i lived through three market corrections as a market operator 197475 1987 and 2001  i lived through a dollar crisis as a public servant in the us treasury  and i havent heard a person yet talk about some of the risk  the riksbank by the way last night and the mexicans raised rates but more important the europeans are talking tough because of their concerns about inflation  i am worried about the pernicious effects of inflation  i think president hoenig hit the nail on the head when he said its easier to lower than to raise 
i would simply counsel since i dont have a vote that we should consider the value of keeping our powder dry  its very dangerous in my opinion for policymakers to be driven into a culdesac by futures markets  in response to the question i asked earlier the markets have been all over the lot  i am worried that we have too much of a discussion about what markets expect of us since the fed funds rate is designedas you have made very clear in your speeches mr chairmanto affect the economy and should be so driven  so were i to have a vote today i would be thinking along the lines of presidents hoenig plosser and rosengren in terms of their expression  everybody has been grappling with this issue  we would make a great wrestling team  we are thinking very hard about these matters  but in the balance of risks that i see given the improvement in the data im tempted to consider the value of another cut as insurance against weakness  yet we took a huge step last timewe took out a doublebarreled shotgunand it seems to be reflected in the data that the staff projected  im a little worried not so much of being accused of being asleep at the wheel but of having our foot too heavily on the accelerator if we cut 25 basis points  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president pianalto 
ms pianalto  thank you mr chairman  i like several of my colleagues who have gone ahead of me find myself torn between alternatives a and b  i also wrestled with many of the issues that president plosser articulated so well  i left our september meeting thinking that the 50 basis point cut pretty much put us close to where we needed to be given our outlook and my outlook hasnt changed much in the past six weeks  as i said yesterday im not certain about whether the weakness that im hearing or have heard about during this intermeeting period is simply evidence of the business conditions that are unfolding as i thought they would or whether there is more weakness than i anticipated in september and more weakness than i have reflected in my projection  the committee has said repeatedly and for good reason that our decisions are going to be dependent on the incoming data and as many have already said the data seem to be confirming my outlook  but financial markets do remain on edge  moreover many of the incoming data are backward looking and hence dont provide me with great comfort when were trying to ascertain what might lie ahead  the projection that i submitted for this meeting as i said yesterday is rather fragile and it wouldnt take much additional market turmoil or deterioration in household and business confidence to push my nearterm growth outlook even lower  so i think this risk is the predominant one that we face today and it is a risk that has weighed heavily on my deliberations for this meeting 
the assessment of risk language in alternative b addresses these concerns and i was contemplating supporting no change in the fed funds rate and the language in alternative b  however in the climate that we find ourselves i believe that just saying that the risk to the outlook is to the downside isnt enough  i do think that we should be taking out some insurance against possible further deterioration in the nearterm outlook  so i support a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate target today and i support the language thats embodied in alternative a  i believe that the language does acknowledge the likely slowdown in the economic expansion  it also acknowledges that if we take this action today the risks are roughly balanced and importantly it suggests that further policy easing may not be forthcoming  i also like the language that was added regarding the recent inflation numbers  finally as governor mishkin pointed out it is difficult to express all of these issues in our short statement  it seems to me that we can draw some comfort from the fact that the minutes will be providing the public with a greater understanding of the different views that were expressed today and some of the challenges that i wrestled with  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  president stern   
mr stern  thank you mr chairman  as i commented yesterday i think theres a respectable chance that by the middle of next year or so the economy will be growing again at a reasonable rate and because of the lags between our actions and their effects on the economy there is not a lot we can do about what happens in the intervening period anyway  it seems to me that those kinds of considerations are at the heart of something like the case for alternative b  leave well enough alone  there has been some progress in the financial markets and that stepthat is taking no action todaywould in my view be consistent with longterm achievement of the dual mandate  but i am an economist  so on the other hand financial conditions are still unsettled and its difficult to know the degree of restraint that changes in the cost and availability of credit relative to conditions back in june will have  it might well be prudentthis is the case for alternative ato take additional steps today to err on the side perhaps of doing too much since it seems to me that it is inevitable that a lot of uncertainty is associated with the economic outlook 
weighing those two cases i come down in favor of alternative a but with misgivings and let me share those misgivings  i think that there is some chance that financial conditions will remain unsettled for several more months at a minimum and so in some sense that part of the environment may not change very much in the next few months  you pointed out yesterday mr chairman that an important ingredient in the greenbook forecast is a cessation of the drag from housing roughly around the middle of next year  lets suppose that in fact turns out to be precisely correct  thats all well and good but we wont recognize that it has actually happened with any degree of confidence given the flow of data probably before august or september at the earliest even if the anecdotes get a little more positive  so i can see a situation in which the circumstances we confront over the next series of meetings dont look very different from the circumstances were confronting today  i think we have to be very careful of not letting good intentions on a decisionbydecision basis get into what turns out to be a policy error as a consequence of an accumulation of those kinds of decisions  its the timeinconsistency problem obviously and that gives me some pause even though i come out at the moment in favor of alternative a 
as far as directive language for a variety of reasons that others have expressed i am uncomfortable about characterizing the balance of risks the way they are characterized in alternative a  i think that a way we might consider going although its not the most elegant solution is perhaps just to drop that first sentence under alternative a  we succeeded at the last meeting in making it clear that we were data dependent and you had significant swings in probabilities of funds rate reductions over the intermeeting period  i think this would leave us in that circumstance  as president pianalto pointed out we have the minutes coming out and we may well have the communications package including the narrative coming out with it  obviously theres a threeweek lag but it seems to me that that would be an effective way of communicating what we want to communicate and perhaps of putting the attention on that communications package which i think would turn out to be valuable 
chairman bernanke  governor mishkin 
mr mishkin  gary im a little puzzled here  im not sure i understand  what i understand from your reasoning is that the key issue is that you dont want to give an impression that we are going to keep on cutting   
mr stern  thats right 
mr mishkin  so if you take that first phrase out youve taken out any issue of balance of risk  my view is that the markets would interpret this as actually indicating that the committee would be more likely to cut in the future 
mr stern  well i dont know  if you look at the language from the last meeting we were careful not to precommit to anything and it seemed to me that the markets understood the data dependence  i forget the precise numbers but i guess the probability of a  percentage point cut ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent or more when you think of it in terms of bigger cuts too  it seems to me that the proof of the pudding is in the eating  that seemed to work out okay 
mr mishkin  but in this case if we do alternative a we will have cut 
mr stern  well i dont follow that  we cut even more significantly at the last meeting 
mr mishkin  thank you 
chairman bernanke  governor warsh 
mr warsh  thank you mr chairman  let me be the most recent but i guess not the last to say that this is a close call  i suppose i take more comfort in that than some around the table because i am pleased at the progress though it is not perfect and were not even back to an honest view of normal in the financial markets  that its a close call suggests to me that the data in the financial markets are normalizing  i guess the alternative of a close call would have been to have this be an easy call and i suspect that the only way this would have been an easy call would be if we continued to have bad data and bad sentiment in the market  so i think were in the realm of a close call and we shouldnt completely rue that situation  again thats probably a function of the resilience of the economy the resilience in the markets some time and patience and maybe even a little good monetary policy  so im okay with that i think 
the judgment that we make on moving or not moving  percentage point today matters but it strikes me as being considerably less important than what the future path of policy is expected to be in the capital markets  so i think that the most important judgment we make is in the fourth paragraph rather than the first paragraph  let me spend a moment on what the financial markets are telling us with a degree of certainty which speaking for myself is quite surprising  again i think they have responded to real data over the past couple of weeks  they havent changed their probabilities based on utterances from the chairman or from any of us and i take some comfort in that  i might disagree with what theyre saying but i dont think that theyre just giving us a mirror image of our own views  so i take what theyre saying and the certainty with which they have taken on board that were going to move today  its not determinative  its not dispositive nor should it be but the debt capital markets at least think that the economy is worseworse than the greenbook and worse than many of us feel  again i would say that i have to take that on board without giving it too much predictive capability   
i think that brian is rightgiven the fragility in the financial markets and given the surprise that we had for them last time i wouldnt want our judgments today to add to that volatility which i think would be quite possible  in sum i would say that i support alternative a as written on this revised page  i think that absent having strong language in alternative a section 4 it would look to some as though the markets dictated this outcome  i think a4 and robust balance of risk language is important so that the markets dont believe incorrectly that we succumb to what their wants are  i think that previously including at our last meeting when we spoke about uncertainty they seemed to understand what that wasthat it wasnt that were just calling it uncertainty but we really have cuts ahead  for better or for worse theyve now learned a lesson  uncertainty with even pretty good data led us to cut this time if we end up adopting alternative a  so if we use that same uncertainty language i dont think it would have the effect that it had last time of letting folks be on both sides of the bet on whether we would have continued actions  so im comfortable with alternative a paragraph 4  it is a way of addressing market expectations and addressing our uncertainties by insurance but being very clear to the markets that they ought not prejudge nor have we prejudged the outcome next time  the references to inflation risks there and in alternative a paragraph 3 are useful to address some of the broader concerns we have about commodities and the foreign exchange value of the dollar  so with that i think that alternative a is the right thing to do and that it does preserve for us plenty of ability to call it as we see it when we meet next  thank you mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  thank you  governor kroszner 
mr kroszner  thank you  as i discussed yesterday i take very much a riskmanagement approach  but i also like the way that president evans characterized that riskmanagement approach as your having to think about the costs and the benefits and very much focus on the potential costs  so in thinking about the best way to go i think about if we do or dont move then what are the downside risks to each  weve seen as many people have said a lot of progress in the financial markets  we have also seen a little backing up of some of that progress and a flattening out over the past couple of weeks  in particular the one set of markets that we havent seen as much progress in as certainly i would like is housingrelated markets  that is for me the most direct channel between financial turmoil and the real economy   
as i described yesterday my tail risk scenario is sort of a slowburn scenario  it is not one in which this financial turmoil will get out of control and we will have an incredible mess so we need to cut interest rates to prevent it  i think that was more the concern and focus in our previous meeting  we have seen improvement although i dont think weve seen normalization particularly in the housing markets  given that weve had some but not full normalization and then given that we have resets coming and the tightening of credit standards the elimination of a lot of subprime lending the rules that we are going to put out and the rules that the congress is considering regardless of how carefully we craft them or whether or not the congress makes progress the effect on the housing market will undoubtedly be somewhat chilling  so i see a potential slowburn scenario in which it is valuable to be buying some insurance against that as early as possible  these problems may be peaking toward the middle of next year because thats when they have the most potential to have a negative effect on housing prices which as others have described could have this sort of simultaneity issue or vicious cycle aspect that could lead things to go down   
given that we have those conditions and we have that potential going forward it seems worthwhile to buy that insurance now  what is the cost of doing that  of course it is in terms of inflation and inflation expectations  as the markets have changed their expectations about what were likely to do at this meeting and even as they have dramatically changed their path of future policy moves theres very little evidence that inflation expectations at least up to the fiveyear horizon have moved up significantly  there is a question of how to interpret that longerterm change in inflation expectations i take it very seriously and i think we have to try to understand it better  but i dont think that theres an enormous cost in terms of moving now versus six to nine months from now to buy more insurance against what i see as a challenge from the recent financial market turbulence  i think there is also a concern which president poole raised that if we have a fairly large surprise to the markets it could reduce or even reverse some of the progress that has been made in some of the markets potentially forcing us to move more than we would like at the next meeting 
so that said i think it is very important and very valuable that we make a move now  as other have said it is a close call because we have to worry about the cost with respect to inflation  one way to contain that cost as a number of people have said is to clarify the path going forward to show that what were doing now is responding not to current data but to the forecast about the data  obviously when the markets were expecting gdp at 31 and it comes in at 39 were not saying that were reacting to current market data by making a cut  but we are thinking about the potential future effect and then trying to give some guidance through a balance of risk statement  im open to a modification of that statement to try to convey that we think we dont necessarily need to do more with respect to the challenges that are coming now but were going to continue to remain vigilant and look at things like the housing market and other markets that have potential to have negative ramifications for the whole economy  thanks   
chairman bernanke  thank you  vice chairman 
vice chairman geithner  thank you mr chairman  i think the economy is slowing  even the nonhousing part of the economy is slowing a bit  housing prices are still obviously sliding down  we dont really claim to know much about where theyre going to end up or where we are in that process but it seems that they are falling and probably at an accelerating rate  our modal forecastour meaning from the submissionsis for an economy that slows further and runs below trend over several quarters  but if you just look at the size of the bars on the submissions the size of that bar about downside risk to growth is very high much higher than the bar about upside risk to inflation  there is a huge amount of uncertainty about what equilibrium is and where shortterm interest rates should be over time  but i think it is fair to say that we are now at the high end of if not slightly above most of those estimates of where equilibrium is  therefore it seems to me sensible that most of our submissions had a downward slope to the path of the fed funds rate going forward over this period 
the question then is not principally whether to move but when and what signal of a change or no change should come  i think it is a very close call and everything that i say i say with a lot of unease and discomfort  if the choice is to stay firm but to signal more explicitly than we did in september that were likely to move further that seems to me just a bad choice  i think it is likely to amplify many of the risks that you are all worried about and it probably would make people more tentative about coming in and doing what theyre going to do to let this thing work through the markets because they will be living with our acknowledgement of substantial downside risk without action and uncertainty about whether were going to move  i think you might argue that a decision not to move with an explicit asymmetry in the balance of risks to growth would lower the path going forward and add to that uncertainty in some sense 
i do not think that the markets are so fragile now that they could not take an adverse surprise of this magnitude even though it is a very very large adverse surprise relative to recent history  i dont think thats a good argument for moving  i think the best argument is that were still in the midst of what is a very delicate and consequential assetprice adjustment in the us economy with a fairly dense thick adverse tail on the potential implications about the evolution in housing  the chairman spoke eloquently early in the yeari think it was early in the year but maybe it was late last yearabout the pattern of history and the acknowledgement that weakness tends to cumulate and you dont really have a lot of experience with sustained periods of belowtrend growth without falling into a more substantial rise in unemployment rates  those risks have to be substantially greater when you have an economy going through this kind of assetprice adjustment 
i found these charts discouraging not reassuring in the sense that were anticipating a slowdown in the rate of growth of credit for the economy as a whole thats comparable to 01  i think the pressure on bank balance sheets is probablyits hard to make these statements with any certaintygreater than it was in 01  at least a reasonable expectation is that its going to be bigger than it was in hindsight in 01 and i think you have a much more substantial impairment to the functioning of what kevin calls debt capital marketsthe industry around the design of securitization and structured finance et cetera which has been so important to the way credit gets originated and moved  that disruption could take a long time to resolve and i think that just has to amplify the density of the adverse tail and the growth outcome certainly with more uncertainty at this time   
i think that it is hard but the better course of valor is to move today and i like the language in alternative a  let me just go quickly through the arguments against it that i find most compelling  the best argument against is the fear that many of us spoke aboutthat even though the inflation numbers have been reasonably reassuring and we havent seen substantial erosion in inflation expectations that we can measure there is a bit of deterioration in the feel in the psychology  we have to be very careful that we dont add to that through our actions or peoples expectations about how were going to behave going forward  but we should take some comfort from the fact that the market is pricing in more than 100 basis points of easing over the next two years  you have to believe that a fair amount of that is already reflected in breakevens reflected in what people are willing to pay for insurance against adverse inflation outcomes and reflected in the dollar  it doesnt mean that if we validate part of those expectations you wont see erosion but we should take some comfort from that 
just one more thing  we have been through three years of very substantial relative price shocks in energy prices commodity prices and some other things  those hit an economy that was growing over the period above most estimates of potential and we have had pretty good performance of underlying inflation and inflation expectations in that context  so even though we look forward and we see whats happening in commodity prices energy prices and the dollar as posing some potential risk of upside pressure on input costs that is hitting the economy in a very different state  the experience of those last couple of years should give us a fair amount of confidence in the judgments we bring as to how we think about inflation going forward  i think we have less uncertainty around an inflation forecast than we would have had two or three years ago and still substantial uncertainty around the growth forecast inevitably given what the economy is going through  the balances suggest that it is better to move today because of that  as i said im comfortable with the language in alternative a  i would be comfortable with governor mishkins amendment to ai think that helps a bit  i have a lot of sympathy for all the arguments against the first sentence in alternative a in any form but on balance i would say that we just dont want to take the risk that by omitting some statement like it we cause people to price in a steeper slope to that path going forward  it is something that we should try to avoid and the best way to achieve that is the language in a  thank you  
chairman bernanke  thank you  thank you all  well it has been said many times but this is very very close and ive thought about it quite a bit obviously  i have a lot of sympathy for president plossers very clear analysis  there have been good data since the last meeting  we have talked about the importance of spillovers  we have not so far seen evident spillovers from housing into other sectors  we did take a preemptive action in the last meeting  inflation is a concern  i think not immediately but some of the factors like input costs are there and market expectations alone are obviously not a reason to move  all of those things are valid and i have thought about all of them  
so why do i favor a cut  most of the arguments have been made  the downside risks are quite significant if the housing situation including prices really deteriorates  i think part of the difference between what the market sees about housing and what we see is that we are a little more sanguine about price behavior than the market is and a decline in prices has effects both on consumers and on the credit system  so i think that risk is fairly important and may swamp some of the other issues  there is some new information that is relevant  the senior loan officer survey and other information suggest that credit conditions are tightening and that this will have an effect i believe in some significant markets certainly including housing  other information like consumer sentiment and consumers views of the labor market suggests some slowing and some weakening  the decline in sentiment in the markets in the past two weeks is very interesting  on one level i feel as though we failed to communicate somehow however i dont know exactly where the mistake was  the markets seem to be responding to information about earnings reports and projections of future activity and so on both in the financial sector and in the real sector and as a number of people have said i dont think we can entirely ignore that information  so i think there are some good reasons on the real side to take out a bit more insurance as has been said  i agree with the vice chairman that the credit markets probably could stand the surprise but they have become somewhat more uncertain and i think their basic problem is macro uncertainty  it has to do with concerns about tail risk and that is something that we can i think address a bit 
the point has been made a number of times first by president yellen that the current rate could be construed as being slightly restrictive and that creates an argument for a somewhat lower rate  an additional argument is that the core inflation rate has come down some since last year and so the real federal funds rate on that basis has gone up 
finally an argument that i would bring to you is about tactics and the vice chairman also alluded to this  most of the paths that we submitted include a path for policy that is perhaps slightly lower than the current one and the question is how we do this  if we take alternative b which i think is the most obvious alternative on the one hand we dont take an action and on the other hand we express alarm about the economy and say well probably be cutting in the future  that makes calibrating how the longerterm expectations will respond to that very difficult  i think it would on balance tighten expectations a bit because we didnt act but it does create some uncertainty  the advantage of alternative a even as we take a cut is that we will i hope curb expectations for sustained additional cuts through several mechanisms  first in the economic growth paragraph we have switched language from actions intended to help forestallvery indirectto should help forestall suggesting that we are now more confident in our ability to prevent bad outcomes in the economy  second we haveand this will certainly be noticedtaken note of energy and commodity prices among other factors and we have highlighted our concerns about inflation  third the rough balance of risks certainly indicates that we are not eager to cut again quickly unless the data clearly support it  so a lot of this is tactical about how to take control of expectationsyou know how to manage the markets views of our policies  and i just felt a bit more comfortable with taking the action but then using that to recalibrate our balance of risks  for what it is worth 75 basis points of easing has been pretty much the standard fed medicine for financial crises ever since 1970 or so in that respect we are in good company  thats my recommendation25 basis points with alternative a  any questions or comments 
vice chairman geithner  with the mishkin amendment or without 
chairman bernanke  what exactly was the mishkin amendment 
mr mishkin  it was to add a phrase before the downside risks to growth to say the committee judges that the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the somewhat reduced downside risks to growth  it would give a flavor that in fact our actions have reduced the downside risk 
chairman bernanke  i worry about that  for example by saying that the action should help forestall instead of is intended to forestall i think we address that 
mr mishkin  i didnt feel strongly about this  it was just maybe ill do it in speeches afterward 
chairman bernanke  the other comment that came up i think president hoenig and president stern mentioned it is not exactly softening but emphasizing the uncertainty that surrounds our judgment  so another possibility and i have always regretted making suggestions on the statement is that we could take the first sentence from the september paragraph 4 cut out the phrase since the committees last regular meeting and say developments in financial markets have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook  however the committee judges that    and we could put that at the beginning of the assessment of risks  is that as appealing  i dont know  i guess my prejudice is unless there is strong sentiment to stay with what we have because that is what people have talked about 
vice chairman geithner  i think the problem with that is that developments of financial markets on balance since the last meeting have been reassuring  the panic has receded  the disruptions are more contained and so i dont think that works 
chairman bernanke  okay  i withdraw that  any other comments  all right  if not ms danker will call the roll  lets just note for the record that for the first time we will be voting on the entire statement 
ms danker  i will start with the directive from the bluebook  the language is as follows 
the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  to further its longrun objectives the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent 
then the statement which i will not read in its entirety is as written under alternative a in the revised october 31 table that was handed out 
chairman bernanke  yes 
vice chairman geithner  yes 
president evans   yes 
president hoenig   no 
governor kohn   yes 
governor kroszner   yes 
governor mishkin   yes 
president poole   yes 
president rosengren   yes 
governor warsh   yes 
 
chairman bernanke  thank you very much  i need to have the board for a moment 
meeting recessed 
chairman bernanke  let me just address quickly the last item on the agenda which is communications  on october 19 you received a memo from the subcommittee that describes the latest round of changes to the projections  i wont repeat what they are but if there are questions we can take them  i dont believe we received any comments on this round  ill talk in a moment about getting this ready for prime time  but what id like to talk about now is as i discussed in september asking the committee for a consensus to release these projections  they would be released with the minutes of the current meeting on november 20 which is one day less than three weeks because wednesday is the day before thanksgiving  so we would release it on tuesday  the necessary explanation of the projectionswhat they mean and how to interpret themwould be in a speech that i propose to give on november 14  that speech would be preceded by a press release from the fomc describing the plan in general terms  you received copies of the press release  michelle do we have other copies  does anyone need it 
ms smith  it was not changed from what you received  i have extra copies if you need one 
chairman bernanke  all right  if anyone needs a copy michelle is happy to give you one  i would talk in general terms about this approach why were doing it what the implications are and so on  id be happy to share my draft remarks with anyone who would like to look at them  let me be cleari do not plan to reveal any of the data from the projections  they would be released to the public for the first time in the minutes and so it would obviously be very important for everyone not to release that information  president plosser 
mr plosser  your speech is november 14 
chairman bernanke  my speech is november 14 and the release of the minutes will be on november 20  that would give people some time to digest the ideas  yes 
mr lacker  and the press release 
chairman bernanke  the press release would be on the morning of november 14 before my speech  on previous occasions when the fomc has announced communication changes they have followed the meeting by some weeks  its not unusual for that to happen 
there are questions about timing whether we should think about doing it later  we had some discussions about this  my own view is that this was the most convenient time  january would run into the monetary policy hearings for example  if there are serious problems in the markets or anything like that i am prepared to add material about the markets or to substitute another speechto do whatever is necessary to address that issue  but i do think that besides the natural rhythm and the fact that we are about as far as we are going to get in finetuning this the fact that this has appeared in the press suggests that we should just go ahead and get it out soon if possible  in a moment im going to ask you for your comments and then ill ask you for your consensusfirst on releasing the material and second on the speech and the rollout of the press release 
let me just say that as brian indicated we do have until tomorrow close of business to revise our projections  this counts  this is the real thing  please take a look at your projections in light of this mornings data and in light of the discussion today  in the future we will not be doing this every meeting only four times a year  so in that respect it wont be such a burden as i know it has been  so i urge you please to do that  let me now open the floor for any comments or questions about projections the rollout plan or anything  president poole 
mr poole  i have two comments  brian talked about the skewness which i gather we are going to describe in words but not use the histogram  i have the following question about the skewness  i was one of those who said broadly similar and heres how i would look at it  you start with some point estimate  lets make it simplenext year fourth quarter to fourth quarter  you ask yourself how far down you would have to move the point estimate such that the probability to the right and the left would be about the same  if the amount that you would have to move that point estimate is a fraction of a standard error then i would interpret it roughly speaking as that there are symmetrical risks  i just have the suspicion that people who are talking about weighted to the downside are in a way mixing up the first moment and the third moment of the probability distribution  so i worry that as i think brian was worrying that this will give a message thats going to interfere with the communication that we also want to offer about the policy path  thats the best way i can think about itto ask about how far you would have to move your point estimate to make the probability to the right or left roughly the same  i would also note that the greenbook for example has reduced the point estimate for next year  percentage point from june to now roughly speaking  maybe i can even ask dave about whether he thinks the distribution around the current point estimate is very skewed and i could also go on and ask how far down he would have to move that point estimate to make the probability to the right and left about the same 
the other point that i want to makeand it is really in many ways a much more important pointis that when we disclose the 2010 inflation projection and presumably mr chairman at the february monetary policy hearingsassuming that some member of the congress actually asks you a question related to monetary policy which is not a givenlaughter a very logical question either then or sometime in the future would be where you personally stand what your number is in that projection  i would very much like to know that answer in advance because i would be more than happy to conform my estimate which i regard as a target to the number that you would throw out  i think theres an issue here  in an inflation projection for 2010 that varies from roughly 15 to 2 the numbers are materially different and i think that question is going to come back at us over and over again  so i wont say any more about that but i do believe that i would hate to be in a position of having to explain why my number is different from yours 
chairman bernanke  well let me say first on the mode and the median you make a good point on the first issue about risks  the question to ask yourself is given your most likely forecast on which side are the largest and most costly deviations most likely to occur  in which direction are the risks skewed  that is the way to think about it 
mr poole  well i would keep separate the cost from the distribution itself 
chairman bernanke  no i dont think so  i think you ought to put in some costs 
mr poole  im not saying i would ignore the costs but maybe we need to be clear about what this probability distribution is supposed to mean  i thought that this was supposed to mean simply the weights that i would give on various possible outcomes in terms of the probability that the forecast might be 1 percentage point below or 1 percentage point above the central tendency however i described it  now i agree that a full analysis requires that you also add the costs to those but i would interpret that as not being part of the projections process for gdp and inflation but rather youd fold that in through the policy decision as to how you weight those various possible outcomes  but i have interpreted it all along as being really a statement about your probability distribution on the outcomes unweighted by the severity of the outcome 
chairman bernanke  okay  i think that the answer would be pretty similar in either case  so we can discuss this at another time  on your second question i think im kind of a special case because people will overweight what i say if i give a number  so i would not give a number and what i would say is that what matters are the views of the broad committee and i dont want to distinguish myself from the broad committee  it is a committee decision process  if individuals want to give their numbers i suppose thats okay  but i would urge you to consider the externality a bit which is that there will be some desire to figure out who is where on the distribution in order to assess who is holding which type of policy preference and so on  certainly many of us have often given our views of what price stability is and so on  i dont think i want to prohibit that but my recommendation would be to be a little fuzzy a bit careful about being too precise and too sharp about that number 
mr poole  well it wont really matter very much with me because i will be out of here before too long but i have long been on record as bringing the number down and so i cant back off that  thats what i believe and so im going to keep that 
chairman bernanke  thats fine 
mr poole  but ill disappear from the calculus next spring anyway 
chairman bernanke  president fisher 
mr fisher  mr chairman i appreciate your answer  the one worry i have had about this exercise which is much better the way it is now expressed and presentedi think it is ready for prime timeis that we might be divided as to our individual instincts  we do operate as a committee  we have said this a million times but id like to reiterate it  to me its the last bastion of integrity here in washington  to go down a path of who is saying what just threatens to tear us apart and i would urge your response on everybody else as well  thank you for the spirit in which you answered that 
chairman bernanke  president lacker   
mr lacker  no comment   
chairman bernanke  anybody else  president lockhart 
mr lockhart  has there been any reaction to the greg ip story  have we received any feedback from the principal audience for the projections 
chairman bernanke  yes and there have been no problems  the response has been positive 
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  yes vice chairman  im sorry 
vice chairman geithner  i want to come back to president pooles question  president poole you said a fraction of a standard error  how large a fraction of a standard error would you want to use as a basis  really im not sure what the standard error is in this context  but just in terms of how you think about this how large a fraction of the standard error 
mr poole  well i was one of those who put down bthat both the distribution and the skewness were broadly similar to the past twenty years  so i came out that way  i was trying to offer a way to think about this issue and for those who believe that the probability distribution is way over on one side a way to think about it  how far would you have to move that point estimate  i wasnt trying to give the answer i was trying to give a way to approach the question 
vice chairman geithner  mr chairman maybe we should clarify just this one point  did you leave the question abouti dont know what this chart is called it is not going to be in the addendum to the minuteswhat those bars show about the balance of risk  is it about just the probability of the outcome or about the probability of outcome and the costs or consequences of the outcome 
chairman bernanke  may i ask the staff do you have institutional memory on this question   
mr madigan  i am not sure what the question is exactly  what is the question 
chairman bernanke  is the skew that determines the risks simply the probability of outcomes or is it the probability weighted by the cost of certain outcomes 
mr madigan  well i think it is a matter of how the members interpreted it in responding  laughter  the memorandum to the committee asks whether the risks around your projection for each variable are weighted to the upside weighted to the downside or broadly balanced 
mr kohn  i think the balance of risk statement in the announcement has had the utility weight on it there have been times when the committee was more concerned about falling to one side or another  but i at least interpreted the forecast as simply whether there were skews to one side or another  if i may have the floor to talk a bit to president pooles point  i think we do say in the statement that there are upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth  so i would be concerned if the whole committee shifted to the middle because then i think we would be contradicting the announcement that we made so i think your point is good  i mean you ought to be sure that you really do think there is downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation or whatever and adjust it for the policy choice that we made today  
chairman bernanke  the utility cost is relevant in the statement and you cant take a balance of risks unless you compare them in terms of cost  there is no other metric by which you can compare them  so in that case it has to be costweighted  but i think it is more or less equivalentthe univariate answers you are giving about mode versus median 
mr poole  but if we view the projections as being a statement just about the probability distribution of the various outcomes this might be an important point for you to explain in the speech that you give because the whole thing is labeled projectionsi guess we have been calling it a projections exerciseand so i have interpreted that as a discussion of the numbers 
chairman bernanke  i think we wont go too far wrong by interpreting it as a probability distribution in the shape of the probability distribution for outcomes 
mr poole  thats the way i have interpreted it 
chairman bernanke  okay  president lacker 
mr lacker  at the risk of introducing further moments of the probability distribution into the discussion have we been instructed as to whether our projection is a mean or a maximumlikelihood estimate 
chairman bernanke  i think our standard procedure is that it is a modal 
mr lacker  a maximumlikelihood estimate 
chairman bernanke  yes 
mr madigan  the memorandum to the committee says please provide your projections of the most likely outcomes et cetera 
chairman bernanke  im sorry president plosser we have kept you waiting 
mr plosser  its not important  i dont have any comments  i just wanted to say that i think the staff has done a great job and the subcommittee has done a great job  this is a very important step forward for us and i am strongly supportive of it  i want to thank governor kohn janet yellen and the other members of the subcommittee for getting us here and you for taking this step forward  i believe that as we go through this time after time it will be refined  we will stumble over a few things and the language is going to be tricky but i just want to commend the committee for taking this step 
chairman bernanke  let me also commend governor kohn president stern and president yellen for their excellent work  we really appreciate it  governor mishkin 
mr mishkin  thank you  i just want to return to the point that the chairman president poole and president fisher raised  in my conversations people have expressed different views at this juncture about what the optimal longrun inflation rate is  people know that i am a 2 percent kind of guy and i know good people here who are 1 percent kinds of guys  but in talking to people about this i hear a lot more consensus and that people dont feel strongly  so i would be in concert with what president poole said  if the chairman said how about x i would be more than happy to say giddyap i am with the chairman  so again my colorful language  but the key point here is that i think it would be very helpful at this juncture that people really not emphasize differences but that in fact there really is consensus on this committee  that takes one of two forms  one is if you had something in the past thats fine but you can say that you had that in the past but you are actually comfortable with where the general committee is and that way you can soften it  two is a case in which somebody like me has not actually publicly talked about an inflation goal  in that case i would keep my mouth shut on the issue  in terms of this initial launchagain emphasizing the fact that there really is a lot of consensus on the committee because we know that the press loves to create the opposite of consensus because it sells newspapersthe more we can be supportive and to the extent that we can look unified on this the better off we are  i sense that is actually where the committee is so i would encourage it in this process 
chairman bernanke  governor kroszner 
mr kroszner  i just wanted a clarification  in the explanation will we say that the projections are based on what we have done  for example today given that we are having a policy move and i am not sure that everyone around the table had anticipated that move today in their path will we be articulating that these are not the numbers that we came into the meeting with but these are the numbers that we think after the policy action has been taken 
chairman bernanke  yes lets do that because it will be more consistent with the statement  so let me ask everyone to rethink their risks conditional on our policy move today 
mr kroszner  thank you 
chairman bernanke  vice chairman 
vice chairman geithner  sorry mr chairman two points  one is a concern to which i have no solution  the chart that is now called chart 1 which has evolved over time has a slight disadvantage because it doesnt have fans around it because we all didnt like the fans of having the sense of a pretty narrow range of likely outcomes for the future  i just wonder whether anybody is uneasy given the relatively low probability that we are going to end up within those over time  i dont have a solution to this  i was wondering whether if you changed the scalelaughter  this is a concern with no real suggested solutioni apologize  my second point is more significant  bill i think you asked a good question  mr chairman another question that is interesting is when asked whether the world should interpret the central tendency of the committee at a threeyear horizon for pce inflation as the rate that is consistent with the committees longrun view of price stability how will you answer it 
chairman bernanke  it represents the diversity of views on the committee about that with the additional caveat that not everyone may necessarily believe that we will approach their ideal level of price stability even in three years conceivably  so it is a mixture of elements and thats what i will talk about  again if you would like to look at the speech 
vice chairman geithner  no  i think that is consistent with how it is described and what is discussed but it just goes to the point that bill you raise which is for some of you your optimal horizon is always going to be two years or three years  but you said all that could be said i think about that  
mr hoenig  mr chairman 
chairman bernanke  yes 
mr hoenig  im sorry but i need to understand what you just implied  are we to go back now and redo our projections for this meeting under the assumption that we took the action today 
chairman bernanke  if you wouldnt mind yes 
mr madigan  and appropriate policy going forward  
mr hoenig  okay  but its not what i based my decision on 
vice chairman geithner  tom if you took a view about what appropriate policy was last friday and you have a chance now to assess in light of what the committee did what appropriate policy is going forward whether that has changed and what implications that change has for your forecastisnt that the way to say it 
mr hoenig  but the whole point of the process was to prepare us for this meeting and now i am going to go back and reassess the process i went through in light of what took place in this meeting  if everyone is comfortable with doing that then i would be happy and able to do it  at least i understand that we are all going in the same direction that way  so i am fine with it as long as that is what in fact were doing  
mr plosser  but the greenbook wont be changed  this confuses me a bit  i wasnt quite cleari thought i was but i guess i wasnt 
 chairman bernanke  we can do whatever we want as long as we all agree to do the same thing  laughter 
mr hoenig  if thats it then ill go back and do it  i just want to make sure thats what we all agree were going to do  if that is then fine but i didnt have that understanding before you made that statement 
chairman bernanke  president lockhart   
mr lockhart  is there an inconsistency in adjusting a forecast after the meeting when the minutes are the minutes of the meeting and the forecasts informed the judgments that were expressed in the meeting 
chairman bernanke  no i dont think so  it is based on the information in the meeting including the data we received this morning 
mr lockhart  im not sure i see minutes reflecting subsequent actions or subsequent decisions  
mr fisher  were releasing this with the minutes 
chairman bernanke  were releasing it with the minutes  its not part of the minutes  
mr lockhart  oh okay  good point 
mr hoenig  its like an annual report that has updated information in it  as long as everyone is doing the same thing 
chairman bernanke  i hope president hoenig that you wont be in this situation too often  laughter 
mr hoenig  ive got a long record and i havent been in this situation too often  but i have been in this situation before 
chairman bernanke  any other questions or comments  may i have the sense of the committee to proceed with the release  thank you very much  i appreciate it and i appreciate everyones hard work and cooperation  i think this is a very important step and i am very pleased with the outcome  let me just describe now the sequence of events  i will now give you the date of the next meeting and i will adjourn the meeting  laricke blanchard is here to talk briefly about congressional issues for us and the lunch for cathy minehan begins at 1230  okay  so our next meeting will be tuesday december 11  the meeting is adjourned 
 
end of meeting
